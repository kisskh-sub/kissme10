Not just simple coding…

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:02.339

the entire data system.

and handle transactions…

marrying another guy right now?

00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:38.754
When on earth are you going to get married?

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.830
This time it was the other party's fault.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.291
As the eldest grandson of the family…

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.710
You should get married
before Grandpa passes away.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.462
Siwoo isn't married yet either.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.797
But your sister's married
and doing so well herself.

00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:52.550
Can't you be at least half like her?

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.968

- Still, our parents know each other.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.850
Especially…

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.643
Through brand marketing…

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:10.061
I've gained various…

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.502
- Hands-on experiences…
- Nude model?

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.022
Really?

00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:14.442
With that as my foundation…

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.153
If I could officially join…

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.323
Your company…

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540
That's enough.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.835
Next person, please.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.087
Hello.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.132
I'm applicant no. 763 for the
HR team, Kim Youngwoong.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:41.259
With a deep understanding
of people and organizations…

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.094
I want to create a
positive company culture…

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.347
And contribute to talent development.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.141
During university, through
various team projects…

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:51.936
I learned the importance of smooth
communication and collaboration with members.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:52.937
Through this…

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.137
Keep next Saturday open.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:30.768
I'm setting up a dinner with
Director Choi's daughter.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.110
How was the blind date?

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.781
How much did your mom tell you?

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.620
Your mom was lamenting to mine again.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.122
The eldest grandson shouldn't be like this.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:54.917
The Confucian girl's here.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.920
You'll seriously regret it later, you know?

00:13:58.712 --> 00:13:59.797
Not my business.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.674
Mind your own.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.885
I'm doing very well, actually.

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:08.681
Probably?

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:15.938
But serious question here.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.816
Have you ever felt lonely?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.823
Not really.

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:31.078
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.548
Hey.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.194
By the way, did you hear about Minwoo?

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:46.926
Jung Minwoo?

00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:48.511
Why?

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:51.599
He's single and doesn't date, right?

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.100
Yeah.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.394
I think he doesn't like women.

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.313
Is that so?

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:01.274
I think he just doesn't
like people in general.

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:04.903
Well, he's always eating alone and stuff.

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:09.449
But he seems pretty close
with CEO Sooyeon, right?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.619
Were they college classmates or something?

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:12.952
Hey.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.455
What if they're secretly dating?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.748
Oh, come on.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.374
What nonsense.

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.127
The CEO has a boyfriend.

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:21.377
Ah, right.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.112
"I think he doesn't like women"

00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:48.822
"Is that so?"

00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.534
"I think he just doesn't
like people in general"

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.208
Would you like another drink?

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.670
Same one, please.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.593
You're drinking a lot today.

00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:11.594
Huh?

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.348
Ah, yeah.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.997
Why do people get married?

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:44.419
Why must they insist on living with someone

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.797
when it's obvious that
they're not even compatible?

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.425
Dating, marriage, whatever.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.929
That whole process is so inefficient.

00:16:55.931 --> 00:17:01.478
It's easier to just work like a machine
without hurting others.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.985
Drinks are simple.

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:10.696
Like water or soda.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.114
You just drink them as they are.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.285
No need to mix, clean and efficient.

00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:34.428
But cocktails are different.

00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:38.015
Different ingredients mix and blend.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.269
Sometimes they clash,
creating a story in each sip.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.961
I think dating and marriage are similar.

00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:13.175
When people who don't seem
to match collide, mix and blend…

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.720
They create a unique
flavor just for themselves.

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:20.140
Isn't that process too complicated?

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.400
Sometimes it's too bitter.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.236
Sometimes it's too sweet.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.864
But when you find the perfect combination,
you cannot forget that taste.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:44.832
But yeah.

00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:48.585
Sometimes I also wish I
could live like a machine.

00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.879
Because…

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.549
I have a family to care for.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:57.052
So love and romance
feel like luxuries to me.

00:18:57.928 --> 00:19:00.847
Getting close to someone and opening up…

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:04.643
Sometimes feels like an unbearable burden.

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:07.437
So…

00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:10.648
For now, I tell myself that focusing
on work is the only right thing to do.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.526
I live on convincing myself of that.

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.077
Welcome.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.327
Hyung!

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.219
Is that the person…

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.597
From that blind date…?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.836
