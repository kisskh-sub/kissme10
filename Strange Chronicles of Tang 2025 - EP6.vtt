[Episode 6]

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.670
Easy with it,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.240
or the dew will all end up on the ground.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.080
Thank you for the advice,
Madam Master of Rain.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.560
It's you?

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.110
After hearing what you said,
I asked around

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.000
and learned
that this is a lucrative business.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.660
So, I-I wanted to give it a try.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.870
Madam, do you live near this place?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.480
Yes.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080
Who do you live with?

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.710
My husband.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.070
Why are you being so distant with me?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.800
Since I came of age at 15,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.680
I'd run into several scoundrels

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.509
every month.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.120
You're a scholar.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960
Why are you behaving like them?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.150
You're getting it wrong.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.880
How could I possibly be like...

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.759
Previously,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.250
to drive away

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.000
that punk Da for you,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.120
I nearly lost my life.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.350
Have you forgotten it?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.570
Da craves money.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.390
You didn't hire him, did you?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.680
My husband and I are deeply in love.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.040
Whatever your intentions are,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.440
please stay away from me.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.080
Got a finding?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.630
What's going on?

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.079
Why is she giving you the cold shoulder?

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.990
Madam Master of Rain

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.640
is quite popular in town.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.030
Isn't it just normal

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.160
that she ignores me?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.190
Go get that piece of clothing

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.030
for me now.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.400
I think it was hung there not long ago.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.730
Maybe it's related to the missing person.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.680
Yes.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.260
This is Lai's robe.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.150
I made it for him myself.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.940
Where is he?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.410
He...

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.800
hasn't been found yet.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.260
Then...

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.000
where was this robe

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.960
discovered?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.640
In the Ascension Forest.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.630

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.930
He died out there,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.310
and someone hung his robe

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080
in the Ascension Forest.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.930
That's not too bad.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.780
Not too bad.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.390
Officer,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.300
please hang this robe

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.560
back on where it was.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.120
So I won't be haunted by Lai's spirit

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.030
anymore.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.190
You...

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.650
Early this morning,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.840
I found Lai's robe

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.060
at this place.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.540
It's been confirmed to be his by his wife.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.910
You nearly lost your life

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.310
at this place yesterday.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.290
Why would you dare come here again?

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.250
Where is Lu Lingfeng?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
Why the shouting?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.160
Aren't I right here?

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.960
Exactly.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.890
With you here, what do I have to fear?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.840
I'd really like to know

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.840
what these Ghost Birds do at night

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.750
and what they feed on.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.589
That's the spot, I think.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.930
Right.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.320
This is the spot.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.000
Madam Master of Rain said

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.770
this red robe

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.930
was hanging right here when she saw it.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.840
It seems this robe

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.190
is all we can count on to find clues.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.560
Show me that turquoise

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.240
again.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120
The robe is made of ordinary fabric,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.250
yet the knot button is premium turquoise.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.690
Such a combination...

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.310
must be rare in the market, right?

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.070
Right.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.390
In that case,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720
let's go visit

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.520

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.070
Which old friend?

That button is turquoise.

from your shop.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.920
Why didn't you report it?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.560
That robe was not for sale.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.690
I kept it for myself.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.560
But you couldn't recognize
your own clothes,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.360
and used the words "seems like."

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.920
He's just getting old and foolish.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.670
He's been working here

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.720
for over a decade,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.830
dealing with these clothes every day.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.960
He's inevitably confused sometimes.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.800
Working here?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.200
So you're not the shop owner.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.510
But how did you

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.730
answer my question earlier?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.160
Well, he...

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.390
Enough said about him.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.590
Let's talk about you.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.190
Now that he's not the owner,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.120
are you?

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.830
I...

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.680
Mr. Dai!

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.750
Mr. Dai,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.630
you've made the leap

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.159
from manager to shop owner.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.720
Isn't it time to pay the difference
for the coffin?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.240
It's crafted from cypress wood,
not mulberry.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
So you need to pay me 500 extra coins.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.500
Is that cypress coffin worth so much?

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.120
A cypress coffin

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.960
is certainly more expensive
than a mulberry one.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.700
A cypress coffin

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.240
can deter evil spirits

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.730
and monsters

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.510
from the deceased.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.350
That's right.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.750
How brilliant of you.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.940
Such a nice shop

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.400
of your nephew's is now

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.580
in your possession.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.200
Yet you're haggling

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.530
with me for his coffin.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.960
Is it even appropriate?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.780
Butterfly,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.300
give him the money.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.960
Just leave, you awful man.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.510
If you had paid up earlier,
I wouldn't have come at all.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.080
Thanks.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.810
So your nephew died?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.920
Shancai died of a sudden illness.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.240
There were witnesses.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.710
Did I ask you about that?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.220
He really died of a sudden illness.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.240
He had no children.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.150
As his uncle,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.450
I had to step forward

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.550
to hold a funeral for him.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.510
Then you conveniently took over his shop

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.720
as its new owner.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.470
Let me ask you.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.550
How much savings did your nephew have?

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.300
Less than 100,000 coins.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.240
It sounds like you think

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.890
it's too little, don't you?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.030
Dai!

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.150
Why did you kneel down?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.150
I...

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.800
My legs suddenly went weak.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.410
Have I told you to get up?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360
What's your name?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.270
Butterfly.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.390
How are you related to him?

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.120
Not in any way!

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.390
I'm Shancai's wife.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.550
Then how could you
deny being related to him?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.010
Isn't he Shancai's uncle?

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.680
Yes, he is.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.350
Your husband is dead.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.630
This shop should be yours.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.690
Why is it his now?

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.630
It's not like that.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.760
Uncle is just managing the shop for me.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.240
He claims to be the shop owner.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.750
Others consider him that way too.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.080
Why don't you refute it?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.510
I...

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.030
Mr. Dai.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.700
Please tell us

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.240
how your nephew died.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.250
I didn't kill him!

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.510
Then you must've murdered your husband.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.710
I didn't do it either!

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.490
Are the two of you...

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.670
having an affair?

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.590
She seduced me!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.000
You old bastard!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.730
We agreed to never tell.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:03.870
[Butterfly, Shancai's wife]

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.150
Yet you've confessed even before being

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.920
taken to court.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.520
Bah!

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.450
You did seduce me!

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.150
You had thoughts about me and peeped at me

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.120
while I bathed.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.720
How else could I have
successfully seduced you?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.670
What kind of excuse is that?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.960
I...

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.760
The two of you, stop bickering.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.870
Just tell us how you killed Shancai.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.240
Confess now.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.920
Or you'll be put to torture.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.960
Shancai...

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120
had severe ulcers

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.820
on his back.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.940
The doctor said he must avoid goose meat.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.000
Actually,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.660
he had never eaten goose meat,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.240
so it was easy to fool him.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.030
I just...

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.210
In fact, it was her idea!

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.360
What?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.840
You ungrateful bastard!

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.970
I'm going to end you!

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.480
I'm telling the truth!

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.170
I...

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.720
I'm telling the truth!

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.510
-You're dead meat!
-Official Lu, this...

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.710
What's going on here?

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.150
Before Shancai died,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.420
I decided to

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.000
to move all his valuable belongings

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.440
to my place,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.110
since it'd be ominous

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.520
to do so after he died.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.490
I meant to take this robe too.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.730
At that time,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.210
I dared not leave his home,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.390
being worried
that his friends might visit him

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.520
and get him a doctor.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.360
So,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.700
I hired delivery service.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.300
Delivery service?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.650
Like a courier?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.390
Yes.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.250
Everything was delivered,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.380
except for this robe.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.470
Recently,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.750
I've been wanting to confront them
about it.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.210
Who provided the service?

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.570
The Flying General.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.510
We often have them deliver
the expensive clothes

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.480
made in our shop.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.790
Nothing had gone wrong before that.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.980
Here's your statement.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.590
Read it.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.540
Sign it

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.190
if you find it correct.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.250
Let me through!

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.840
Make way, please.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.670
-Give me a hand.
-Let me through!

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.080
Sure.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.570
Gentlemen,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.670
here are the logs.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.990
[Flying General]

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.750
This is it.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.280
[Courier: Chen Shubao]

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.870
It was Chen Shubao who made

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.750
this delivery.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.550
He has the name
of a fallen kingdom's ruler.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.480
I knew he couldn't be a good person.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.180
Mr. Kang,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.320
you seem to have much knowledge
about the history and famous figures

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.610
of the Central Plains.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.870
Though I'm Sogdian,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.420
I've long been a Chang'an resident

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.480
and a Tang citizen.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.950
Where is Chen Shubao?

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.090
Have him come over.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.650
He no longer works here.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.320
Then where does he live?

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.480
I don't know.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.050
But you should.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.840
You recruited him to deliver items,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.790
yet you don't know where he lives.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.080
How would that leave you

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.270
if he stole anything?

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.750
This person is somewhat unusual.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.390
When he first came here...

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.810
My name is Chen Shubao.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.870
Isn't it

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.000
a king's name?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200
Where do you live?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.220
Does it matter?

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.680
Of course it matters.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.390
What if your purpose of working here

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.320
is to steal valuable items

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.910
that customers entrust to us for delivery?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.110
I won't steal.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.260
I'm a scholar.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.620
And I'm a businessman.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.400
Words are not enough to convince me.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.200
I must know

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.730
where you live,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.200
[Chen Shubao]

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.800
meet your family,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.440
and inquire

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.120
about your character in the neighborhood

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.180
before hiring you.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.740
That's too much trouble.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.440
How about this?

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.510
I'll leave a deposit with you

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.370
as a guarantee that I won't steal.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.870
A rich man chose to work as a courier.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.790
Mr. Kang,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.030
didn't it strike you as odd?
