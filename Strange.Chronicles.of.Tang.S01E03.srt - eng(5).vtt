[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.960
[Episode 3]

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.470
Tell us.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.790
So the 3 of us

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.650
don't have to suspect each other.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.710
Otherwise...

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.120
Don't! Don't! Don't!

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.480
I know nothing about any blood letter.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.110
When did I ever write a blood letter?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.640
You messed with us
and then tried to leave?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.560
If we hadn't locked you up here,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350
you would have run away long ago.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.350
You wrote a blood letter asking for help,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.210
and now you don't dare to admit it.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.270
Then I have no choice.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.430
Though I hate to do it,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.760
I'll have to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.750
kill you.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.110
Get off the horse.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.320
Don't make any noise.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.470
I...

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.210
I did think about

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120
renting a place somewhere else.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.870
But now I don't want to leave.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.800
You three

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.280
have treated me well,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.420
taking turns keeping me company.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.579
This is even better

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.870
than having multiple wives.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.960
Living such a pleasurable life,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.290
who would want to leave?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.910
And also,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.570
when I wanted mushrooms for my birthday,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.730
you three

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.280
gathered mushrooms to make soup for me.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.760
How could I possibly think of leaving?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.840
Did you really not write a blood letter?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.870
No, I didn't.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.360
Look.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.520
If you don't believe me,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.650
see for yourselves.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.230
Where are the wounds

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.210
on my 10 fingers?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.740
Where have they ever bled?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.760
Could it be that Lu Lingfeng

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.290
has deceived us?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.280
Manniang,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.320
you don't need to be so vigilant.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.160
He must have made a mistake.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.400
We've lived in the Xiuzhen District

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.500
for several years.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.510
Surely nothing will happen.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.540
It's still your fault.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.030
Manniang told you to talk less,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.690
but you just wouldn't listen.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.060
Who put him in the cage?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.800
I did.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.680
Let him out.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.159
If he's locked up too long and gets sick,

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.760
how will he relieve our woes?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Manniang,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.870
you make it sound like

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.070
you're the only one who cares about him.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.750
Thank you, ladies.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.660
Woe-Reliever.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.950
Since it wasn't

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.800
you who wrote that blood letter for help,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.370
you might as well stay here.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.720
Better than having you go elsewhere

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.950
and flirt with other women.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.720
You don't need
to take the palace examination anymore.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.320
We will take good care of you.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.790
For the rest of your life,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.080
this is how it'll be.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.420
Someone else is here!

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600
Ladies, protect me!

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.490
Someone has finally come to rescue me.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.490
These 3 female bandits

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.080
are extremely vicious.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.150
I've been imprisoned here in darkness,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.670
forced all day long

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.320
to relieve their woes.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.510
Jerk!

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.090
Didn't you just say

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.720
it's a pleasurable life
living with the 3 of us?

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.450
This forest is called Ascension Forest.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.170
I pulled the robe off the tree

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.640
3 days ago in the morning.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.430
According to local custom,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.760
whenever someone dies,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.800
their family applies a little sheep fat

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.460
to the clothes or accessories

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.040
they last wore

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.460
and hangs them on branches
in Ascension Forest.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.870
This robe

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.610
belonged to someone who died?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.630
Hanging up the deceased's clothes

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.270
is supposedly to summon their soul,

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.710
but actually, it serves to appease ghosts.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.270
This way, the spirits of the dead

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.040
won't linger

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.100
in the family home.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.270
So, isn't it the truth
that once someone dies,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.600
their family just wants
to get rid of them?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.040
Why?

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.600
Did I say something wrong?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.200
Not at all.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.120
It's just that nobody else
thinks of it that way,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.600
but now that you mention it,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.200
I think you make a good point.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.480
Why is there a green bird over there?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.390
Indeed.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.800
It's bright green.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.030
Madam Master of Rain,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.400
do you come here often?

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.810
Every morning.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.920
Because, besides being a Master of Rain,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.320
I have another identity.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.680
I'm a dew collector.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.070
You collect morning dew?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.600
Exactly.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.600
A Master of Rain, much like a coroner,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.070
is passed down through generations
in the family.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.870
My generation has no male heirs.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.740
I was 10 years old then.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.360
And somehow, I became

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.650
Chang'an's first female Master of Rain.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.120
I can't say I hate it,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.290
nor do I particularly like it.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.270
But I always wanted to choose something

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.270
for myself,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.600
so I became a dew collector.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.800
What's the dew used for?

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.159
For years, Xiuzhen District
has been accepting

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.310
cultivators from other districts

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.170
and even from other prefectures.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.830
There are nearly 1,000 of them now.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.680
They believe

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.630
that if they continuously consume
morning dew,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.090
they'll eventually ascend to immortality.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.530
That's quite a business
with no investment.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.480
That morning,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.480
as usual,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.450
I came to Ascension Forest to collect dew.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.750
It was my first time

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.680
taking a robe from Ascension Forest.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.400
I really liked the color

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.070
and thought I'd wear it
during rain prayers.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.670
But when I tried it on at home,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.730
for some reason,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.050
a bone-chilling cold came over me.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.300
It was terrifying.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.160
Just then, someone
came collecting old items,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.120
so I sold it.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.030
I know I was wrong,

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.549
but the robe was hung for the dead,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.370
so it's not really stealing, is it?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.270
I suppose not.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.390
I just want to know

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.480
where exactly

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.130
this robe was hanging.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.020
Right here.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.240
On that branch?

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.310
Anything else?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.510
If not,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.920
I need to go back and cook for my husband.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.270
Thank you for your trouble.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:09.970
Today,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.670
thanks to your timely arrival,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.470
that scoundrel didn't succeed.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.320
Thank you.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.370
D-Don't mention it.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.280
If it weren't for Madam Yingtao,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.780
I would have been done for.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.670
Then I should thank you too.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.240
No need.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.400
I didn't come to save you anyway.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.000
Well, you're still a good girl.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.750
Mr. Su is quite fortunate.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.670
I... I really am a good girl.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.340
You're not bad either.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.120
Well,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.060
how did this turn
into a mutual admiration session?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.080
You two should not

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.570
stay here too long.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.510
Though this place
is called Ascension Forest,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.440
the yin energy is very strong here.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.600
Thanks for the reminder.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.460
We'll just look around and leave.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.390
That woman is strange.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.000
Is she?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.630
She just complimented you.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.680
She's right, though.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.120
I am a good girl.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.200
Yes,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.030
yes, you are.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.000
Can a good girl

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.390
climb trees?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.750
Of course.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.150
Yingtao!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.730
Are you okay?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.130
I'm fine.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.340
Why were there so many birds in this tree?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.620
And they're all green.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.320
According to legend,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.390
after death but before burial,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.320
a type of bird flies out from the coffin,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.390
called Sha.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.720
The "Sha" that means "kill"?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.480
Yes, yes,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.670
that's the word.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.400
It has emerald green feathers,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.670
transformed from human ghosts.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.270
It shouldn't be called Sha.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.080
Might as well just call it Ghost Bird.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.720
Its common name is indeed Ghost Bird.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.950
These birds are strange.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.700
I didn't see any outside.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.700
They must

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.200
only live in this forest.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.780
So,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.270
it's not the birds that are strange;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.550
it's this forest.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.720
Can you climb up again?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.270
Yes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.390
Have you found any clues up there?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.790
No.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.870
There's not even a thread

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.970
on these branches.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.080
Could Ruiqiu have lied to us?

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.960
Here, catch this.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.360
Hang it there.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.540
What are you doing?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.960
Quickly, search carefully.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.550
If the robe had knot buttons before,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.720
they must have been torn off

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.670
when Ruiqiu pulled it down.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.730
Hurry, look for it.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.550
Su Wuming.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.000
Is this it?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.900
This should be it.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.960
The fabric is ordinary,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.530
but this knot button

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.790
is made of turquoise.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.440
The robe

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.130
has quite a history.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.680
Run now!

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.700
Guys.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.030
You must be wanderers
of the martial world.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.150
Who sent you

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.960
to assassinate us?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.720
Not gonna say anything?

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.480
Fine,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.600
I'll tell you something.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.410
The man behind me

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.410
is under my protection.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.860
If you dare take his life

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.330
or harm him in any way,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.160
I will fight you to the death.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.720
Until

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.980
I shed my last drop of blood!

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.390
Thankfully, you've been

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.850
by my side, protecting me.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.960
Otherwise,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.260
I would've died twice.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.150
Quick, help rub my back.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.950
What's wrong?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.120
When I was saving you,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.050
I pulled my back.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.750
Good thing I've scared

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.960
those 2 assassins away.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.840
Otherwise, we'd both be dead.
