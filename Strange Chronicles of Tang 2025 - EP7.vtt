"Behind me, unseen those to come."

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.240
Who are you?

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.000
I...

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.940
I'm a businessman.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.809
No one introduced you.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.080
What do you want?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.200
D-Don't hurt me!

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.049
P-Please don't hurt me!

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.720
I...

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960
I might have come to the wrong place.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.290
I'm leaving right now.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.590
Get back to your work.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.790
[Relieve Woes]

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.990
We need a proper plan.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.510
This is no ordinary place.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.060
Yingtao,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120
you did a good job.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.490
This...

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.250
It's you?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.240
Aren't you from the county office?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.150
What have I done wrong

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.480
to be treated like this?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.280
Let me ask you.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.910
How much did you

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.020
pay Lady Hong's Secondhand Store

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.350
for that robe?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.440
Fifty wen.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.630
Stop lying, or you'll be dead meat.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.120
I...

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.250
No one will save you.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.480
Thirty!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.860
Thirty wen.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.800
Officer,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.790
I did trick 20 wen
out of the county office,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.650
but that's not a capital offense.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.750
It's hard to make a living in Chang'an.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.390
I still owe much money to the pawnshop.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.720
I had no choice!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.400
Seems he's ready to tell the truth now.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.060
Yes, I am!

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.200
I really am!

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.670
What exactly does
the Relief-from-Woes Shop sell?

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.240
This shop

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.570
doesn't sell anything.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.480
It's a sanctuary where hearts are soothed.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.480
Sanctuary?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.390
Tell me more.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.030
Chang'an does have a lot to offer,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.960
but the living cost here

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.890
is just too high.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.000
Both commoners and officials
feel under pressure.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.670
That gave rise

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.150
to the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.030
It's designed to

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.600
relieve people of woes and stress.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.510
Every three days,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.630
there is a Confession Assembly
in the shop.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.270
Though I became

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.870
an official member long ago,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.390
I still haven't reached the lowest rank

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.160
of iron.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.840
So,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.510
I can only listen
from the outermost circle.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.750
I don't even have the privilege

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.600
to pour my heart out in front of others
or pay membership fees.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.860
It's a privilege to pay membership fees?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.130
Never heard of that.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.110
Just because you haven't heard of it
doesn't mean

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.640
you can deny its existence.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.510
Officer,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.560
please let me go.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.910
Today, a gold member is coming for a visit

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.550
for the first time.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.680
I need to go meet him.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.080
This is his first visit,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.510
yet he's already a gold member?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.930
How to make that happen?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.910
Well,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.200
it's difficult.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.120
But not very difficult.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.180
To become a gold member immediately,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.670
one needs to offer gold, of course.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.000
What kind of sanctuary is this?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.530
All is just a scam for money.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.620
I'll go destroy it.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.020
You...

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.790
No need to rush.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.430
Let me ask you.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.150
How much gold does it take

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.550
to become a gold member?

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.320
No fixed amount.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320
It's negotiable.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.790
The Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.070
is not meant for commerce.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.480
Since there are too many members,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.910
it's impossible to give everyone

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.840
a chance to talk.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.360
The shop thus puts its members

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.090
into three tiers, namely iron,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.510
silver,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.240
and gold.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.790
There are limited spots

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.840
for gold members.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.750
The rule says

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.750
only those who have paid 100 visits

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.480
are qualified to compete for a spot.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.150
But given my connections,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.600
I can help those

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.360
who feel like
getting things off their chests

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.200
in front of others

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.480
as a way to relieve themselves of stress
become gold members,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.840
provided that they offer

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.640
valuables like gold and silver.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.670
I see.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.980
Aren't you going to meet someone?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.360
Off you go.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.080
Okay.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.190
There you are.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.430
Are you Sheng?

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.350
Yes, exactly.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.780
Why weren't you waiting here?

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.790
My stomach got upset

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.260
and started acting up,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.040
so I had to go find a washroom.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.390
It took some time.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.800
Please forgive me, sir.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.480
Lead the way.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.210
This way,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.130
please.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.810
That voice sounds so familiar.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.870
Yingtao,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.750
come over.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.010
Have you seen this person before?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.550
He's too far away,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.240
with that veil covering his head.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.100
I can't get a good look at his face.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.270
Who is he?

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.530
I'm going all in.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.960
Y-You have a gold ingot?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.150
This is designated

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.870
to my use as Chief of Secret Agents

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.410
for collecting

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.770
special intelligence.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.150
What's your plan?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.510
You're not going to buy

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.040
a gold membership, are you?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.390
Not one,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.270
but two.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.370
I have a feeling

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.750
that there's something interesting

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.440
about the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.000
Let me open your eyes
to a whole new world.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.860
Oh, please.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.910
You just want me to protect you

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.570
from losing your life, right?

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.910
You should've played dumb.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.860
You do know when to make your move.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.330
That being the case,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.840
how can I not grant a gentleman's wish?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.210
"Before me, unseen are the ancients."

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.600
Officers,

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.490
why did you catch me again?

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.830
Wait a minute.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.480
Are you trying to buy

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.360
two gold memberships

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.760
with only one gold ingot?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.240
Isn't it too little?

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.600
Strike the deal,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.440
or...

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.710
I'll cut off your head.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.560
It's deal.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.040
"Before me, unseen are the ancients."

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.270
What's the next line?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.530
"Who wouldn't say so?"

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.480
What did you say?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.960
Women shouldn't respond with that line.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.290
They should say, "Whatever you say, sir."

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.330
"Who wouldn't say so?"

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.240
"Whatever you say, sir."

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.480
Just head to

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.670
the golden masks.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.000
Then, a man will say,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.130
"Gold melts, and silk is stained."

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.670
All you need to do is respond

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.330
with the next line of the poem.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.400
What about me?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.120
Women should answer,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.750
"Friendship should be tested in person."

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.000
What's all that?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.560
Do keep it in mind.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.590
A wrong answer

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.100
will get you killed.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.360
"Gold melts, and silk is stained."

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.840
"Friendship is tested
in the shifts of fortune."

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.130
"Friendship should be tested in person."

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.320
It turns out the two of you

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.320
are gold members invited by Master.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.150
Please proceed.
