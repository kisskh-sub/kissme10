Support Admin Watch on

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.225
Don't let them take what's yours.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.685
Don't be fooled.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.382
Show them who's in charge.

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:23.105
And you don't wait for
weakness, you create it.

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.618
Follow your heart.

00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.328
Parkour, park our, park our!

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:27.728
Kapour, kapour, asshole!!!

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:28.857
Profanity.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:33.293
I'm jealous.

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:35.152
You agreed to be my fiancée.

00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:39.560
What do you think you're doing here?!

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.593
It hurts, I didn't do anything!

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:44.036
I told you, you're mine.

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:49.309
You really targeted Jay-jay, huh?

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.894
Why did you do that to Kiko?

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:51.812
Kiko.

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:53.146
Please forgive me, Jay-jay.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.214
Just don't do it again, Kiko.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:57.776
Why weren't you answering your phone?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.694
What if the incident with
Rory happens again?

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:01.112
You're too attached to Jay-jay.

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:02.572
That's too much.

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.865
Falling in love is so hard.

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:05.575
There are two guys chasing after you.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.660
What are you talking about?

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.161
Keifer ain't shit.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:09.871
He's selfish when it comes to girls.

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:10.956
Yuri's a coward.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.564
Jay, he doesn't fight fair too.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.483
He makes a move without us knowing.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.547
As time passes,

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:22.241
I'm filled with so many
questions in my mind,

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.456
and my feelings.

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:32.209
As well as economic classes,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.962
we shall never be free of dominations.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.799
What message do you think
the author is trying to convey?

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:40.801
Ms. Mariano.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.137
Ms. Mariano!

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:45.156
Sir?

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:46.672
What's the answer?

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:50.035
Huh?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.140
I'm supposed to answer now?

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.022
Can I have more time to think?

00:01:53.654 --> 00:01:54.864
My question is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:58.059
what message do you think
the author is trying to convey?

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:06.137
Sorry, Sir.

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:07.494
I don't know.

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:14.837
Why are there still questions I don't
know how to answer up until now?

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:19.356
Class!

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:20.507
Class, reminder.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.903
Reminder, you have your
upcoming outdoor retreat.

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:24.946
Okay?

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.149
Huh?

00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:32.094
Shall we go on a date at the retreat?

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:34.354
It's a retreat!

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:36.023
I'm out of here.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:37.667
Jay give that to me, I'll carry it.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:38.334
Oh!

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.253
It's just light.

00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:40.397
There's nothing inside, see?

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.756
Oh, whatever!

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.299
I don't know anymore!

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:46.492
I'll just avoid these two for now!

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.510
Okay.

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:30.989
Hmm.

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:33.098
I feel like, this should be here.

00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:34.825
There!

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.916
Oh, I have an idea!

00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:37.815
Okay.

00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:39.872
Hey!

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:41.040
Jay, let's buy Yogorino please!

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:42.417
I've been craving it
for so long, please Jay!

00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:43.877
Please, please, please.

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:44.961
Jay, Yogorino!

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:45.796
- Shh!
- Please.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.921
- Just one.
- You wish!

00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:48.339
You don't even clean up after yourself,

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:49.603
and now you're making requests.

00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:51.909
Look at this, you're adding more mess.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:53.785
Wow, you even brought lights.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.597
Amazing, you're turning
my room into a storage unit.

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.789
Jay, come on it's just Yogorino!

00:04:58.165 --> 00:04:59.101
- Whatever!
- Wow, so selfish.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.852
Jay, please!

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:03.086
Just Yogorino, please!

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:05.648
I'm begging you Jay,
please, just one Yogorino!

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.649
Just one, please.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.443
I've been craving it forever, Jay.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.178
You know what, what if
the rabies reached your brain?

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:12.447
It wasn't treated in time.

00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:13.698
You're seriously something else now.

00:05:13.722 --> 00:05:15.783
Then that's more reason
for you to buy me Yogorino.

00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:17.493
What if that's my last wish?

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.645
You'll feel guilty for the rest of your life!

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.290
Fine, forget it!

00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:23.234
I'll just leave if that's
how you're going to be!

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.097
Wow.

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:26.860
Fine, take this!

00:05:27.277 --> 00:05:28.403
So dramatic.

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:30.506
- You're always like that.
- Wow, amazing!

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.799
You're packing my stuff!

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:33.885
- This is mine!
- You're shameless, that's mine!

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.053
You've got some nerve!

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:36.013
- Fine Jay, forget it!
- But that's really mine!

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.513
Don't talk to me anymore, I'm leaving.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.622
Okay, okay!

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.206
I'll buy it for you!

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:41.892
Really?

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:42.917
Yes!

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.311
Promise?

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:45.336
Yes, promise!

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:47.005
Thank you, Jay!

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:49.235
Buy your own snacks too,

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:50.259
so we can eat together.

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:52.111
Wow.

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:53.535
Why don't you come with me instead?

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:55.699
No need.

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:56.990
You can handle that already.

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:58.575
You survived
seventeen years without me,

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:00.143
you can handle this too.

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:02.455
You're such a pain the ass!

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.479
Annoying!

00:06:04.982 --> 00:06:05.625
So annoying!

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:06.252
That hurt.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:07.651
I'm going broke because of you.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.153
You're treating me next time.

00:06:21.623 --> 00:06:22.624
Smells so good!

00:06:30.674 --> 00:06:32.759
Are you going with Eman tomorrow?

00:06:34.553 --> 00:06:36.722
Do you have plans on Sunday, Jay?

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:39.975
These two annoying boys again.

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.020
Can you let me think for a moment?

00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:46.540
Oh.

00:06:46.565 --> 00:06:47.565
I'll go change first!

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.085
I love you, Jay!

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.109
Damn you!

00:06:53.034 --> 00:06:54.535
What flavor would he like?

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:57.909
Good thing there's a pint for takeout.

00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:07.014
You're taking forever to choose.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.562
David!!!

00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:09.354
Ouch!

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:10.385
What was that for?

00:07:10.714 --> 00:07:11.483
What do you mean "what was that for"?

00:07:11.507 --> 00:07:12.855
You scared me, you jerk!

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.092
You looked so serious.

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:15.886
I'm choosing, okay?

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:17.182
Hurry up already.

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.429
My treat.

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:20.556
Really?

00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:22.236
No take backs!

00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:24.978
Hmm...

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:26.730
One large...

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.499
Mango.

00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:29.191
- Speculoos.
- Speculoos.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:30.125
Yes.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.881
And one pint of Berry Choco Crunch.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:35.906
But this one

00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.217
let's get it later since it's for takeout.

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:38.885
Okay.

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:39.909
I'll be back.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.726
Hi, Ma'am.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.751
One Mango Speculoos please.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.397
One Berry Choco Crunch.

00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:53.048
Where's my Yogorino, Jay?

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.720
You wait!

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.325
Thank you, Ma'am!

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.641
Okay, thank you!

00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.310
One Mango Speculoos for the lady.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.312
Thank you!

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.065
So you went out just for Yogorino?

00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:12.859
I've got a pest at home.

00:08:13.735 --> 00:08:14.836
Where is that kid anyway?

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.798
Why didn't you bring him along?

00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:17.322
That brat is too lazy.

00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:19.950
He even pestered me into
buying Yogorino for him.

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:21.410
How about you?

00:08:21.473 --> 00:08:22.474
Why are you here?

00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:24.203
Uhm...

00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:26.278
Unwinding.

00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:27.738
- Hmm?
- I've been overthinking.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:29.792
Why?

00:08:30.252 --> 00:08:31.253
I don't know.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.403
About what?

00:08:36.258 --> 00:08:37.384
A lot of things.

00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:40.136
Just tell me.

00:08:42.848 --> 00:08:43.848
It's just

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:45.618
you wouldn't understand, Jay.

00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:46.977
It's just random thoughts.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.984
Where are you?

00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:55.735
Why aren't you replying?

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.988
Why do you care where I am?

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.271
Are you my boyfriend?

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:00.917
What is it?

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:02.624
Oh, nothing.

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:03.952
Must be a wrong send.

00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:05.473
It's Keifer, isn't it?

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.550
I knew it.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:10.578
Are you and Keifer together?

00:09:13.503 --> 00:09:13.981
Sorry.

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.547
- This is your fault!
- Sorry.

00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:22.196
So fussy.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.220
It's just a little.

00:09:23.638 --> 00:09:24.848
It's fine, it's just a few.

00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:29.227
I'll poke your eyes out!

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.521
Huh?!

00:09:30.562 --> 00:09:32.189
Your eyes, you're staring so hard!

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:33.291
No!

00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:35.066
The necklace!

00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:36.476
I was looking at your necklace.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.533
Why is there a ring on it?

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.530
Ah...

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.076
Uhm, it was just given to me.

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:47.811
I can't wear it yet, so

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.301
I just placed it here for now.

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:52.023
I see.

00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:53.935
Thank you.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.021
That's not from me.

00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:55.814
Who is it from?

00:09:55.838 --> 00:09:56.838
I don't know.

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.051
Who told you to give
this necklace to me anyway?

00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:03.428
Don't mind it.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.931
Come on, tell me.

00:10:06.348 --> 00:10:08.284
Or at least give me a clue.

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.331
A clue?

00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:11.728
Okay, here's a clue.

00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:14.147
Do you know any child of Poseidon?

00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.651
You don't know anyone?

00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:18.859
Even from books?

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:20.106
Films?

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.466
Oh, maybe

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.909
maybe I know a fictional character uh...

00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:27.877
Percy

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.204
Percy!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.432
Have you been meeting up with Percy?

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:32.462
No.

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:34.435
He just sent it to me.

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:35.752
But you guys talk?

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.098
He only calls whenever he wants.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.506
That's it.

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:44.511
Maybe you can try to contact him now?

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:45.821
Because

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.639
he called me before,

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.534
but the number he used
doesn't work anymore.

00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:51.351
Please, David.

00:10:51.893 --> 00:10:52.936
Please.

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:55.689
I really need to talk to him.

00:10:55.814 --> 00:10:57.482
I can send him a message instead.

00:10:58.233 --> 00:10:59.943
But I can't guarantee he'll respond.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.026
- Okay?
- Yeah.

00:11:03.071 --> 00:11:03.965
Smile.

00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:04.364
Hey!

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:05.758
Wait, I'm not ready yet.

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:06.782
Sent.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:08.593
You're good, huh.

00:11:08.618 --> 00:11:09.661
Now we wait.

00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:10.893
We wait?

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:12.706
Does he reply quickly?

00:11:12.914 --> 00:11:13.914
We'll find out.

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:17.543
There!

00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:24.509
Remove that ring from her necklace.

00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:27.220
Or I will kill Yuri once I get back.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.431
Ahhh!

00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:53.599
Why do your eyes look like that, Jay?

00:11:54.706 --> 00:11:55.782
You look scary.

00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:01.421
Your eye bags have
eye bags of their own too.

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:04.382
I didn't sleep well!

00:12:06.134 --> 00:12:09.614
Percy didn't reply after his last message.

00:12:09.638 --> 00:12:10.906
What was that about?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.807
Why did he say that about Yuri?

00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:18.313
Wow, you even took a picture.

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.522
Look at yourself.

00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:22.275
[phone buzzing]

00:12:23.902 --> 00:12:24.902
What's that?

00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:29.115
Is it yours?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.375
- You're making a mess.
- Sorry.

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:41.878
Just put it there.

00:12:43.713 --> 00:12:45.173
Did you throw away your phone, Jay?

00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:47.591
Uhm...

00:12:48.218 --> 00:12:49.237
Nothing,

00:12:49.678 --> 00:12:50.804
I'm just annoyed.

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:55.159
The person I wanted to text
and explain isn't replying.

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:57.977
But the people I'm avoiding keep texting!

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.821
Do you have rabies in your brain too?

00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:03.492
Give that to me.

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:11.007
Hello?

00:13:11.032 --> 00:13:14.053
Kindly explain to me why
you're not answering my calls

00:13:14.077 --> 00:13:15.412
or my messages?

00:13:17.372 --> 00:13:19.040
I just saw my phone now.

00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:23.508
Are you going to the grocery with Eman?

00:13:25.046 --> 00:13:26.089
Ah yes, I'm going. Why?

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:32.846
Wow, amazing.

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.015
What?

00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:38.902
Ah,

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.229
I won't be able to join you later.

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:43.624
I'll meet up with Rakki and my sister.

00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:44.625
What time will you be home?

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:45.649
Will you be late?

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.545
I'm not sure but

00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:48.569
I'll call you right away.

00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:50.655
Okay, see you later then.

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.300
Where are you going?

00:13:52.324 --> 00:13:53.450
I'll take a shower, duh.

00:13:53.616 --> 00:13:54.909
Okay. I'll go first!

00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:56.021
Hey!

00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:57.681
Wow, amazing!

00:13:57.705 --> 00:13:58.788
You're so annoying!

00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:01.207
Look at that, now he's gonna sing!

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:03.334
[Ci-N singing]

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.714
Good morning!

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.443
Why do you have to
open the gate so wide!

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:11.277
Sorry.

00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:12.301
I'll go ahead, Jay.

00:14:12.927 --> 00:14:13.928
Okay, text me!

00:14:14.304 --> 00:14:15.305
Alright!

00:14:19.934 --> 00:14:20.934
You know what man,

00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:23.062
her arm is only about as big as this bat.

00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:29.694
This bat is solid, but that
girl's face is on another level.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.571
Tell me about it.

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:34.365
Here we go again.

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:36.534
Don't tell me...

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:45.794
Get in!

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.717
What, do you have a problem?

00:14:53.718 --> 00:14:54.886
Do you need back up?

00:14:55.678 --> 00:14:57.198
Early in the morning, and
you're thinking about fighting.

00:14:57.222 --> 00:14:58.982
They're not doing
anything anyways, let's go.

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.305
Some of the boys are sulking,

00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:22.455
they wanted to come along.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.166
Good thing it's just the three of us.

00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:27.937
It's hard to do the groceries
when there are too many people.

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:29.671
They all want different things, right?

00:15:33.883 --> 00:15:34.883
Who's that?

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.363
Uhm.. M-my

00:15:37.387 --> 00:15:38.197
best friend.

00:15:38.221 --> 00:15:39.074
Ah!

00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:40.258
- Keigan's girlfriend!
- Yeah!

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.867
Here.

00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:44.727
Let's split up so it'll be faster.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.648
Then we'll meet at the cashier, okay?

00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:49.941
- Oh, okay.
- Sure.

00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:50.794
I'll get this one,

00:15:50.818 --> 00:15:51.860
you grab a new cart!

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:53.903
You're so sneaky.

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:55.822
This looks delicious.

00:16:05.582 --> 00:16:07.226
This is a good distraction.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.894
At least I won't be thinking
about the engagement,

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:10.187
as well as the King of Assholes.

00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:11.212
Oh my God!

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.926
What is this I'm seeing?!

00:16:19.053 --> 00:16:20.805
Jay-jay, you're going crazy!

00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:22.131
Huh?!

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:24.726
I thought it was the King of Assholes.

00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:28.521
What was that?

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.447
It doesn't even look like him.

00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:41.784
Oh shit!

00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:46.473
Darling, are you okay?

00:16:46.497 --> 00:16:48.791
Ah yes, sorry.

00:16:53.254 --> 00:16:54.727
I literally just said so.

00:16:54.752 --> 00:16:56.312
Yet here you are bugging my mind again!

00:16:57.592 --> 00:16:58.593
Tss.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.024
Is that for me?

00:17:17.612 --> 00:17:18.696
Whatever.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.449
So it is for me?

00:17:22.325 --> 00:17:23.217
No!

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:24.619
It's for everyone!

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:26.788
Ugh, it fell.

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:31.501
Thanks anyways,
but it would be a waste.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.419
A waste?

00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:36.798
Isn't that your favorite?

00:17:37.173 --> 00:17:38.173
Yeah,

00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:39.216
I like sweets.

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:40.752
But

00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:43.158
I like a different kind of sweet now.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.306
What?

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:49.810
Your lips.

00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:56.901
Why are you blushing?

00:17:58.778 --> 00:17:59.778
No, I'm not.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.308
It's hot!

00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:05.827
Why were you ignoring my messages?

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:11.666
It's all crumpled now.

00:18:13.251 --> 00:18:14.460
Did I do something wrong?

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:19.917
Jay!

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.133
Tss.

00:18:23.052 --> 00:18:23.928
I got this!

00:18:24.012 --> 00:18:24.989
I can do this!

00:18:25.013 --> 00:18:25.824
Give it to me!

00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:26.865
I said I got it!

00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:27.701
Let me.

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:28.965
I got this, you're so annoying.

00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:31.310
Give it to me!

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:40.778
Fine, let's push it together.

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.394
Oh wait, grab that.

00:18:55.418 --> 00:18:56.127
This one?

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.003
Yeah.

00:18:57.086 --> 00:18:58.086
Can't reach it?

00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:00.173
I can reach it, you're just closer.

00:19:01.382 --> 00:19:02.508
Okay, if you say so.

00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:03.925
What else?

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.680
I think we got it all,

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.015
I'll pay now.

00:19:10.224 --> 00:19:11.350
Okay. I'll go first!

00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:12.769
I'll wait for you outside.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.979
Why, where are we going?

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.357
I found out something about your father.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.362
Tss.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.576
Where did he go?

00:19:29.452 --> 00:19:30.637
We bought everything already, right?

00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:31.661
Yeah,

00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:33.122
it's all complete.

00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:37.644
What happened to you, Jay?

00:19:37.668 --> 00:19:38.669
Look!

00:19:43.925 --> 00:19:45.819
This kid is really something else!

00:19:45.843 --> 00:19:47.845
You'd think he doesn't drool in his sleep.

00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:50.264
Looks like Section E's
youngest is all grown up now.

00:19:50.848 --> 00:19:52.141
"Grown up," huh?

00:19:55.686 --> 00:19:56.914
Hey, what are you doing?

00:19:56.938 --> 00:19:57.939
Let's take a picture.

00:19:58.231 --> 00:19:59.607
Don't make it too obvious!

00:20:00.024 --> 00:20:01.024
Don't move.

00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:07.842
Send it to me!

00:20:07.866 --> 00:20:09.093
- Send it to me, okay!
- Okay!

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:10.660
- Yo, yo!
- Send it to me immediately!

00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:14.246
Hey, bro!

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:16.934
Ci-N got more rizz than you.

00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.560
While this guy right here,

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.854
can only hold hands
while walking with his girlfriend.

00:20:20.878 --> 00:20:21.815
Stop it!

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:22.898
Admit it!

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:24.132
Weak!

00:20:24.632 --> 00:20:25.776
Asshole, stop it!

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.528
- Bro, you have no game.
- Stop it, the both of you!

00:20:27.552 --> 00:20:28.737
I'll knock both of you together.

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.072
- He started it!
- What?

00:20:30.096 --> 00:20:31.389
- Jay, shall we go?
- Weak! Weak!

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:32.784
Uhm

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:33.867
you guys go ahead.

00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:34.891
Here, take this.

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:36.602
I still have somewhere to go.

00:20:36.853 --> 00:20:37.620
Where?

00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:38.645
I'll just take you there.

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:40.565
No it's fine, it's nearby.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.641
- Bring this.
- Are you sure?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.419
Just text us when you get home.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:45.486
If I have load.

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:46.991
You take care!

00:20:47.405 --> 00:20:49.073
- Take care, Jay!
- Okay.

00:20:49.157 --> 00:20:50.158
Behave.

00:20:50.658 --> 00:20:52.243
They better watch out for you two.

00:20:57.498 --> 00:20:59.208
[phone buzzing]

00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:04.172
Hello?

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.633
Let's go together.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.091
Wait for me.

00:21:07.967 --> 00:21:09.260
Where are we going?

00:21:09.886 --> 00:21:11.572
What did you learn about my father?

00:21:11.596 --> 00:21:13.347
I'll explain later.

00:21:26.324 --> 00:21:28.243
- Hello, Sir.
- Good afternoon.

00:21:29.363 --> 00:21:31.008
- Thank you.
- Wow!!!

00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:33.177
You use a different car every time!

00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:34.052
Lend me one!

00:21:34.076 --> 00:21:34.911
Which one?

00:21:35.018 --> 00:21:36.561
The one we used today?

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:38.194
The one for Mondays?

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.392
The Tuesday car suits you better.

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:41.352
Tuesday?

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:42.353
Which one's the Tuesday car?

00:21:42.377 --> 00:21:44.396
The other cars are on the other side.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.714
So, just pick any.

00:21:47.089 --> 00:21:48.090
Are you serious?

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760
Yeah.

00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:54.931
I'm actually even willing
to give you my entire house.

00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:59.453
Just make sure you won't marry Yuri.

00:21:59.477 --> 00:22:00.645
Tss, whatever!

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:02.306
Tss!

00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:04.253
Even without all that

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.360
you're still gonna end up with me.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.738
Cause remember,

00:22:12.573 --> 00:22:13.574
you're mine.

00:22:19.413 --> 00:22:22.208
I'm not a thing that anyone can own.

00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:26.337
Okay, fine.

00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:28.523
If you don't like that,

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:29.715
I'll change it.

00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:37.890
I'm yours then.

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:48.335
W-Where is it anyway?

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.777
What did you find?

00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:01.205
Nice one.

00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:03.433
- Nice one.
- Damn!

00:23:03.457 --> 00:23:04.467
Nice one.

00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:07.503
- 1,000 laps.
- Hey!

00:23:07.878 --> 00:23:08.938
Hi, Jay!

00:23:08.963 --> 00:23:10.107
What's going on?

00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:11.156
Why are you guys here?

00:23:11.632 --> 00:23:12.859
Are you feeling better?

00:23:12.883 --> 00:23:13.653
Why are you drinking?

00:23:13.677 --> 00:23:14.695
Of course I'm okay.

00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:15.445
I'm strong, duh.

00:23:15.469 --> 00:23:16.362
Let's go!

00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:17.387
Ouch!

00:23:17.422 --> 00:23:18.560
- What was that for?!
- Hey!

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.683
- Asshole!
- Edrix, stop that!

00:23:20.808 --> 00:23:22.452
You're here to hang out, - Ouch!

00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:23.916
If something happens to him I swear!

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.281
Why is it bad?

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:27.719
I think you just want Keifer
all to yourself, that's why!

00:23:28.482 --> 00:23:29.483
Hey!!!

00:23:29.692 --> 00:23:31.670
- Okay, continue!
- Ouch!

00:23:31.694 --> 00:23:33.755
- Ouch!
- You're so dramatic, I wasn't even close!

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:34.506
Go over there!

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.258
You want me to punch you?

00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:37.575
You deserve it, you're
impossible to talk to!

00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:39.017
I'm just kidding!

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.494
- I'm kidding!
- Yeah, sure!

00:23:40.745 --> 00:23:41.745
Enough.

00:23:43.873 --> 00:23:45.041
Why are you so quiet?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Drix.

00:23:48.377 --> 00:23:49.377
Get it.

00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:53.215
Is it here?

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.051
What is it?

00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:56.968
Let me see.

00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:58.530
Hurry up!

00:23:58.554 --> 00:24:00.264
Wait, I can't open it.

00:24:01.849 --> 00:24:02.850
There.

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.982
It's your father, Jay.

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:12.985
W-Where did you get these pictures?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.571
Well here's the thing

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.157
we found out that your
father is the son of uh

00:24:18.449 --> 00:24:19.718
business tycoon?

00:24:19.742 --> 00:24:21.285
And he's currently in New York.

00:24:21.494 --> 00:24:22.828
Aside from that, Jay

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.915
there's something else
we wanted to show you.

00:24:39.322 --> 00:24:40.686
He's with Percy?

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.893
Why are they together?

00:24:53.317 --> 00:24:54.556
I don't know, Jay.

00:24:55.986 --> 00:24:57.231
I'm confused too.

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:01.325
That's all the information we could find.

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:09.625
I just want to get to know my dad.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.211
But Percy

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.840
he's with him?

00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:20.594
What's really the truth?

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:24.140
Jay...

00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:34.358
It just raised more questions for me.

00:25:35.095 --> 00:25:37.309
I want answers.

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.751
Hey.

00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:47.705
I promised, right?

00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:50.791
Whatever happens,

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:52.768
we'll figure it out.

00:25:53.794 --> 00:25:55.087
We'll find the answers.

00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.799
Thank you, Keifer.

00:25:59.258 --> 00:26:00.926
For helping me look for my dad.

00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:05.097
You're welcome.

00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:26.293
If my eyes had a mouth,
they'd be cursing me by now.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.544
At this rate, all this thinking
will just add to my eye bags.

00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:44.665
What happened, Jay?

00:26:45.763 --> 00:26:47.003
Don't you want me here anymore?

00:26:48.557 --> 00:26:49.580
So dramatic.

00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:51.393
Then why are you crying?

00:26:52.186 --> 00:26:53.222
Did something happen?

00:26:54.187 --> 00:26:55.193
What happened?

00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:02.555
I found out something about my dad.

00:27:03.906 --> 00:27:05.546
Shouldn't you be
happy if that's the case?

00:27:08.702 --> 00:27:10.287
I am, but

00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:11.871
but

00:27:13.374 --> 00:27:15.384
our situation is complicated.

00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:22.512
It's okay, Jay.

00:27:25.803 --> 00:27:28.430
The electricity bill will
decrease, don't worry.

00:27:29.443 --> 00:27:30.449
You jerk!

00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:31.910
- I'm talking about my feelings here!
- You're too.

00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:32.745
You're too serious Jay,

00:27:32.769 --> 00:27:34.129
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:35.937
Sorry.

00:27:36.397 --> 00:27:37.874
- I'm not used to seeing you sad, Jay.
- Sir

00:27:37.898 --> 00:27:39.538
- would you like some drinks?
- Thank you.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.503
What if you buy us two some yogurt,
so we'll both be happy.

00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:42.361
Wow!

00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:43.946
Is it really for me or for you?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.781
For us.

00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:54.182
What's that?

00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:55.206
Why do you have that?

00:27:55.749 --> 00:27:57.957
Look, my sister gave it to me.

00:27:58.168 --> 00:27:59.934
She said she's getting me a condo unit.

00:28:00.004 --> 00:28:01.398
Huh, getting you one?

00:28:01.422 --> 00:28:02.631
- Yeah.
- Why?

00:28:04.508 --> 00:28:06.010
I can't come home anymore.

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:09.291
And Mom wants me
to mature already, so

00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:11.448
this is the solution they thought of.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:14.810
What's your plan?

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.064
I don't know yet.

00:28:21.312 --> 00:28:22.326
But

00:28:23.212 --> 00:28:24.630
I think this is for the best.

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:27.740
I mean, I was basically
alone at home anyway.

00:28:28.532 --> 00:28:31.219
Except for the fact that I had
lots of helpers to mess with,

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:32.494
and boss around.

00:28:38.167 --> 00:28:39.201
Jay

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.587
I have a favor.

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:42.969
What is it?

00:28:44.632 --> 00:28:46.300
Apply as my helper.

00:28:47.635 --> 00:28:48.487
You're impossible!

00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:49.654
You're already treating me as one!

00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:50.406
I'm just kidding, Jay!

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.407
You're so mad.

00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:53.074
- "You're so mad", my ass.
- I'm just trying to make you laugh.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.576
Have you seen my room?

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.785
It got messy because of you!

00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:56.995
- It smells!
- Wow, the nerve!

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:58.288
- You got some nerve!
- It was already like that before I came!

00:28:58.312 --> 00:28:59.581
- No it wasn't!
- Yes it was!

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:01.082
- Liar!
- You're unbelievable!

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.542
- It stinks!
- You stink!

00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.419
- You stink, too!
- Oh, that smells good!

00:29:03.443 --> 00:29:04.502
You can smell it cleary, stinky!

00:29:04.526 --> 00:29:05.754
- Oh!
- That's what my room smells like now!

00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:07.005
- Just like that!
- That's what your breath smells like too!

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.798
Like a sewer!

00:29:07.822 --> 00:29:08.989
- Oh!
- Then yours too!

00:29:09.657 --> 00:29:11.283
Whatever, you stink.

00:29:18.332 --> 00:29:20.000
Tell him this.

00:29:30.052 --> 00:29:31.261
Tell him this.

00:29:32.012 --> 00:29:35.006
If you have no intention of
telling me who you really are,

00:29:35.516 --> 00:29:37.512
don't show up or contact me anymore.

00:30:11.468 --> 00:30:12.476
David.

00:30:12.553 --> 00:30:13.576
Have you read it?

00:30:16.824 --> 00:30:18.326
I can't blame her.

00:30:19.393 --> 00:30:21.061
If this reaches Keifer,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.373
he definitely won't let me
get close to Jay-jay,

00:30:23.397 --> 00:30:24.397
you know this.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.690
I know.

00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:26.858
I know.

00:30:27.234 --> 00:30:28.234
Thank you, David.

00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:29.820
For taking care of Jay-jay.

00:30:30.612 --> 00:30:31.612
That was our deal.

00:30:32.322 --> 00:30:34.533
You take care of my girlfriend's
treatment in New York.

00:30:36.326 --> 00:30:37.536
And I look after Jay-jay.

00:30:38.162 --> 00:30:40.775
Good thing you accepted
my offer for Cheon Sa.

00:30:41.957 --> 00:30:44.334
Even though you were
shocked to see me alive.

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.211
I have no choice.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.173
No other hospital
wanted to operate on her.

00:30:50.424 --> 00:30:51.400
Don't worry.

00:30:51.425 --> 00:30:52.593
You'll see Cheon Sa soon.

00:30:53.093 --> 00:30:54.093
Just

00:30:54.428 --> 00:30:55.613
take care of Jay-jay.

00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:56.971
Okay?

00:30:56.997 --> 00:30:58.035
And remember

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:00.934
don't fall in love with her.

00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:14.698
Just get back here as soon as you can.

00:31:15.157 --> 00:31:16.157
Okay.

00:31:33.133 --> 00:31:34.069
Son!

00:31:34.093 --> 00:31:35.511
Sorry for dropping by.

00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:37.906
You left your lunch at home so

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.265
I brought you some
vegetables for you to eat.

00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:43.412
Uhm, Mom...

00:31:43.436 --> 00:31:44.436
Yeah?

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:46.563
Can I go home already?

00:31:48.357 --> 00:31:49.414
No.

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:51.026
You know you can't, right?

00:31:51.527 --> 00:31:53.634
We still have to monitor your health.

00:31:53.659 --> 00:31:55.703
Especially since you felt pain again.

00:31:55.989 --> 00:31:57.366
Stupid accident.

00:31:58.575 --> 00:32:00.011
Which reminds me,

00:32:00.035 --> 00:32:01.912
what did the doctors say yesterday?

00:32:03.831 --> 00:32:05.707
Just same old, same old.

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:08.168
Did they give you new medicine?

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:10.808
No.

00:32:11.004 --> 00:32:13.900
They said my body responds
well with the one I have now.

00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:14.925
That's good.

00:32:15.175 --> 00:32:16.199
Just let me know

00:32:16.718 --> 00:32:18.512
when your spine hurts again, okay?

00:32:21.348 --> 00:32:22.377
Your Dad's here.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.070
Oh, really?

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.246
Hey, Dad.

00:32:27.271 --> 00:32:28.272
Hey.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:49.668
Hey, what are you doing there?

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.896
Don't mind me!

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.605
Don't tell me you're
writing nonsense again!

00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:53.274
No, I'm not.

00:32:53.298 --> 00:32:55.692
That's minus points in heaven, kid.

00:32:55.716 --> 00:32:56.360
Minus points huh,

00:32:56.384 --> 00:32:57.652
that's why I'm attending church.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:58.969
To get additional points.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.721
You go to church?

00:33:01.388 --> 00:33:02.401
Of course!

00:33:02.556 --> 00:33:04.057
Well, sometimes.

00:33:04.224 --> 00:33:05.434
Someone invited me today.

00:33:06.727 --> 00:33:10.230
You should attend too Jay,
to reduce your sins.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480
The nerve!

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:12.523
Just leave already!

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.694
You went to church once
and now you act holy.

00:33:25.913 --> 00:33:26.913
Hello?

00:33:27.414 --> 00:33:28.414
Are you busy?

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.462
Not really, why?

00:33:34.129 --> 00:33:36.298
Let's go to church, I'm almost there.

00:33:36.465 --> 00:33:37.539
Hey, wait!

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:38.799
See you, Jay!

00:33:39.092 --> 00:33:40.092
Huh.

00:33:45.432 --> 00:33:46.934
What are you doing today?

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.230
You both always contact me
at the same time, huh?

00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:55.067
It's annoying.

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:03.784
Hey,

00:34:04.284 --> 00:34:05.260
Jay!

00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:06.286
Oh.

00:34:06.662 --> 00:34:07.829
Where are you going?

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.139
Uhm...

00:34:09.164 --> 00:34:10.248
- Ma'am.
- I'm going to.

00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:13.752
Ma'am, someone's waiting
for her outside.

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.419
Who?

00:34:15.514 --> 00:34:16.415
Who?

00:34:16.463 --> 00:34:17.547
Is it Keifer?

00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:18.233
No, Sir.

00:34:18.257 --> 00:34:19.424
It's Yuri.

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.971
Okay, make sure to come home early.

00:34:25.597 --> 00:34:26.824
I'll go ahead.

00:34:26.848 --> 00:34:29.184
Okay, you guys take care.

00:34:40.404 --> 00:34:43.566
I still can't picture myself getting married.

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.828
But what choice do I have?

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.375
My family needs it.

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:00.674
Are we attending mass here?

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.479
Yes,

00:35:02.509 --> 00:35:03.518
don't you want to?

00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:05.514
It's not that.

00:35:06.346 --> 00:35:07.889
I was just expecting Buddha.

00:35:08.724 --> 00:35:09.738
Buddha?

00:35:10.183 --> 00:35:11.184
Why?

00:35:12.845 --> 00:35:13.972
Why are you laughing?

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.707
You're Japanese right?

00:35:15.731 --> 00:35:16.731
Buddhism.

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.819
What year were you born?

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:24.781
You know some Japanese are Catholic.

00:35:26.074 --> 00:35:27.074
How would I know?

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:36.460
He's so cute!

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.137
Is he with his girlfriend?

00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:40.928
I don't think so.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.311
She looks ugly!

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.318
True, but look at him so handsome.

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.511
I agree, compared to Ella.

00:35:47.261 --> 00:35:50.195
I don't know why these two like me.

00:35:52.941 --> 00:35:54.234
Don't listen to them,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.270
okay?

00:35:56.825 --> 00:35:58.869
For me, you're the most beautiful.

00:36:02.234 --> 00:36:03.242
Where will we go later?

00:36:04.702 --> 00:36:05.702
Anywhere.

00:36:06.192 --> 00:36:07.193
Anywhere?

00:36:07.629 --> 00:36:08.630
How about to...

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:10.595
- Where?
- To.

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:11.620
Where?

00:36:12.287 --> 00:36:13.140
To a motel.

00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:53.141
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:36:13.164 --> 00:36:14.164
Hey!

00:36:14.211 --> 00:36:15.211
Are you crazy?!

00:36:15.254 --> 00:36:16.854
- Inside the church of all places!
- Why?

00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:19.234
I'm just kidding, relax.

00:36:19.795 --> 00:36:21.171
What if I kick you?

00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:22.989
Oh, I know.

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:24.466
Let's just cook instead.

00:36:26.093 --> 00:36:27.093
Are you in?

00:36:34.476 --> 00:36:36.770
Welcome home, young master.

00:36:43.395 --> 00:36:45.064
Sit down there first before we cook.

00:36:45.357 --> 00:36:46.499
Oh, okay.

00:36:52.994 --> 00:36:54.121
Can I look at this?

00:36:55.205 --> 00:36:56.205
Sure.

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:08.343
Here, you eat first.

00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:10.093
Wow!

00:37:10.804 --> 00:37:11.888
You still remember?

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.932
Go, eat.

00:37:15.498 --> 00:37:16.750
This is delicious!

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:19.185
I'll get one.

00:37:20.157 --> 00:37:21.033
This is you?

00:37:21.058 --> 00:37:22.226
Don't look at that.

00:37:22.649 --> 00:37:24.752
Wait, I didn't even start yet.

00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:26.420
It's all embarrassing stuff anyway!

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.588
You're overreacting!

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:28.965
It looks decent!

00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:30.174
What do you mean decent?

00:37:30.198 --> 00:37:31.783
See, this one looks nice.

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.495
- Model.
- Wow, making fun of me now huh.

00:37:35.745 --> 00:37:36.745
Go, eat some more.

00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:40.458
So this is how you smile.

00:37:41.084 --> 00:37:42.395
Ahh.

00:37:42.419 --> 00:37:43.419
Let me see.

00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:47.048
- You're just making fun of me, Jay!
- You really smiled, so gullible.

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:48.792
Wait.

00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:52.679
Why do you look mad in this picture?

00:37:53.138 --> 00:37:54.407
Look, you're the only
one who looks mad.

00:37:54.431 --> 00:37:56.266
You know what
you should stop now, Jay.

00:38:01.013 --> 00:38:02.556
Did you guys serve at the church?

00:38:02.772 --> 00:38:03.857
Good thing you didn't burn.

00:38:04.149 --> 00:38:05.901
Angelo got us in there.

00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:08.195
He said maybe we'd behave.

00:38:08.403 --> 00:38:09.417
What happened?

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:11.322
Well.

00:38:11.347 --> 00:38:12.640
We got kicked out right away.

00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:14.951
Because Keifer punched
the Head Sacristan.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.458
You know,

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:18.888
he's really crazy huh?

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.500
That's the last picture of us together.

00:38:46.453 --> 00:38:47.454
Let's go!

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:49.502
Let's cook.

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.250
- Huh?
- Come on.

00:38:51.784 --> 00:38:52.813
But I'm still eating.

00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:05.459
Oh.

00:39:05.835 --> 00:39:06.896
- Ouch!
- Damn you!

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.213
What, is that how you cook?

00:39:08.297 --> 00:39:10.132
I know the meaning of "baka"!

00:39:10.298 --> 00:39:11.750
I just realized it now!

00:39:11.775 --> 00:39:12.775
What "baka"?

00:39:12.843 --> 00:39:14.386
You said that to me before!

00:39:14.761 --> 00:39:15.530
When

00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:17.698
when it was raining before,
then we slipped in the mud!

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.722
Baka?

00:39:19.516 --> 00:39:20.892
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:39:21.518 --> 00:39:23.687
I'm going to carry you, stupid!

00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:25.063
Where?

00:39:25.647 --> 00:39:26.648
Where's the cow?

00:39:27.232 --> 00:39:28.316
- Ahh!
- Oh!

00:39:28.608 --> 00:39:29.710
Right, I remember now, sorry.

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.027
I was just hot-headed back then.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:34.030
[in Japanese] "Stupid, stupid, stupid".

00:39:36.992 --> 00:39:38.991
I miss being friends with Yuri.

00:39:39.803 --> 00:39:42.765
Why do things have
to be so complicated?

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:46.707
I know.

00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:49.844
I'll teach you some Japanese words.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.630
Why?

00:39:52.278 --> 00:39:53.733
So when we go to Japan,

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:56.094
you won't say random stuff
to the people there.

00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:00.472
Okay.

00:40:00.807 --> 00:40:01.875
Fine, hit me with it.

00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:03.269
Hmm, okay.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.021
Let's do greetings first.

00:40:06.659 --> 00:40:07.993
Say, "konnichiwa."

00:40:08.183 --> 00:40:09.784
That means, "Good day".

00:40:11.859 --> 00:40:12.944
[In Japanese] Good day.

00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:14.880
Wow! You're good.

00:40:14.904 --> 00:40:16.197
Nice, right?

00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:17.531
Alright, now this one.

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.176
Say...

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:19.844
What?

00:40:19.868 --> 00:40:20.868
"Konbanwa".

00:40:21.494 --> 00:40:23.204
It means, "Good evening".

00:40:23.913 --> 00:40:25.057
Konban

00:40:25.081 --> 00:40:26.183
[in Japanese] Good evening.

00:40:26.207 --> 00:40:28.102
Wow, so proud of yourself.

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:29.854
- Acting all smug.
- See?

00:40:29.878 --> 00:40:31.421
That was easy.

00:40:32.005 --> 00:40:33.381
What about "thank you"?

00:40:33.757 --> 00:40:34.883
Ah, okay here.

00:40:34.908 --> 00:40:35.986
Say

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.671
"a rig a to gozaimasu".

00:40:38.887 --> 00:40:39.946
What?

00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:41.282
"Aribato ni Lamas"?

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:42.974
What's "aribato ni Lamas"?

00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:45.745
[In Japanese] Thank you.

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:47.270
Arigato.

00:40:48.247 --> 00:40:49.790
Where are your plates?

00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:51.649
There, over there.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.293
- There.
- Here?

00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:55.779
Arigato, a rig a to!

00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:57.923
Gozaimasu.

00:40:57.947 --> 00:41:00.200
Arigato go..

00:41:01.409 --> 00:41:02.928
Where's the knife?

00:41:02.952 --> 00:41:03.952
Here.

00:41:04.496 --> 00:41:06.498
- Arigato...
- My hands are dirty, sorry.

00:41:07.366 --> 00:41:09.827
Arigato go...

00:41:10.919 --> 00:41:11.920
Arigato...

00:41:13.046 --> 00:41:15.006
Ah, I know now!

00:41:15.632 --> 00:41:16.633
Arigato gulaymas.

00:41:17.425 --> 00:41:19.803
What "gulaymas"?
There's no vegetables!

00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:22.101
I don't want to anymore,
you're laughing at me!

00:41:23.807 --> 00:41:24.974
No, let's do it this way.

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.318
Just copy my lips, okay?

00:41:27.477 --> 00:41:28.477
Like this.

00:41:28.812 --> 00:41:30.313
Arigato.

00:41:31.189 --> 00:41:32.857
Arigato.

00:41:32.982 --> 00:41:34.668
- Go.
- Go.

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.069
- Zai.
- Zai.

00:41:36.444 --> 00:41:37.904
- Masu.
- Masu.

00:41:38.613 --> 00:41:40.383
[In Japanese] Thank you.

00:41:40.407 --> 00:41:41.343
There!

00:41:41.367 --> 00:41:42.426
Great, you did it!

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.077
[In Japanese] Thank you.

00:41:44.994 --> 00:41:46.749
[In Japanese] Thank you.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.581
Gomasu...

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.649
- Ah, how about this one.
- What?

00:41:51.626 --> 00:41:53.128
Say

00:41:54.587 --> 00:41:56.089
[in Japanese] I love you.

00:42:01.344 --> 00:42:02.804
[in Japanese] I love you.

00:42:04.764 --> 00:42:06.485
I know this.

00:42:07.475 --> 00:42:09.394
But why can't I say it?

00:42:11.938 --> 00:42:13.106
Aishi..

00:42:13.773 --> 00:42:15.000
Aishite.. What?

00:42:15.024 --> 00:42:17.837
[in Japanese] I love you.

00:42:17.861 --> 00:42:18.925
Aishi.

00:42:22.031 --> 00:42:22.759
Never mind!

00:42:22.783 --> 00:42:23.950
Let's just cook.

00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:26.630
Yeah.

00:42:27.412 --> 00:42:28.705
That's hard.

00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:37.338
You're smiling silly, are you going crazy?

00:42:38.047 --> 00:42:39.108
No.

00:42:39.466 --> 00:42:41.134
I'm just imagining our future.

00:42:48.975 --> 00:42:51.186
Jay, what's happening?

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:53.730
What's happening?

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:56.417
I'll get a towel, wait a moment.

00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:57.335
Don't!

00:42:57.359 --> 00:42:58.794
Please, don't leave!

00:42:58.818 --> 00:42:59.878
I'm not leaving,

00:42:59.903 --> 00:43:01.070
I'm just getting a towel.

00:43:01.446 --> 00:43:02.840
I'm scared.

00:43:02.864 --> 00:43:04.491
I don't want to hurt you.

00:43:04.824 --> 00:43:05.594
Hurt me?

00:43:05.618 --> 00:43:06.844
You're the one who's injured.

00:43:06.868 --> 00:43:08.304
Yuri please,

00:43:08.328 --> 00:43:09.913
call Keifer.

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:12.558
Call Keifer.

00:43:12.582 --> 00:43:13.726
Jay, I'm right here.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.627
Why would I call Keifer?

00:43:17.462 --> 00:43:19.589
K-Keifer...

00:43:31.184 --> 00:43:32.184
Jay...

00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:43.196
Are you okay now, Jay?

00:43:46.359 --> 00:43:47.611
I'm sorry, Yuri.

00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:50.119
I shouldn't have said what I said earlier.

00:43:50.553 --> 00:43:51.596
It's okay.

00:43:52.664 --> 00:43:54.666
But I wish you had explained it to me.

00:43:56.876 --> 00:43:58.916
I feel like I don't know
anything about you anymore.

00:43:59.879 --> 00:44:01.381
I'm still your friend, right?

00:44:05.343 --> 00:44:07.554
I'm scared to tell you.

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:09.346
To tell everyone.

00:44:11.057 --> 00:44:12.057
Because.

00:44:12.725 --> 00:44:14.578
Because, even I don't understand

00:44:14.602 --> 00:44:16.187
what's happening to me.

00:44:17.939 --> 00:44:19.524
You can tell me, Jay.

00:44:20.114 --> 00:44:21.157
Okay?

00:44:21.609 --> 00:44:23.169
Who knows, I might be able to help you.

00:44:25.518 --> 00:44:27.019
Yuri...

00:44:30.285 --> 00:44:31.286
Uhm

00:44:32.328 --> 00:44:33.830
there's something wrong with me.

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.875
Whenever I see blood,

00:44:40.295 --> 00:44:42.255
something strange happens to me.

00:44:42.714 --> 00:44:43.983
- Enough!
- At first, I thought

00:44:44.007 --> 00:44:45.568
it was just a phobia, but

00:44:45.592 --> 00:44:47.260
over time it became something else.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.597
I lose consciousness.

00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:54.026
But they told me,
I still act as if I'm still present.

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:58.371
I move and start hurting others.

00:45:00.023 --> 00:45:02.609
But no matter how hard I try

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.576
I don't remember hurting anyone.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.949
I don't know where I got it from.

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:13.577
But

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.140
it started

00:45:16.164 --> 00:45:18.249
when Aries' father kidnapped us.

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:20.659
Then it happened again when

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.879
when Cyrus and I fought.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.798
And the last time was with Ram.

00:45:27.008 --> 00:45:29.385
Keifer said that you
teamed up against him.

00:45:32.472 --> 00:45:34.724
We only said it, but

00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:37.644
Angelo and Aries know
what really happened.

00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:39.520
Keifer knows too?

00:45:39.854 --> 00:45:41.334
That's why you wanted me to call him?

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:46.086
If you don't want me anymore because

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.362
of what you learned

00:45:48.363 --> 00:45:50.344
- if you're going to call off-
- No.

00:45:52.568 --> 00:45:53.944
Don't say that, Jay.

00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:57.080
I love you.

00:45:58.764 --> 00:46:00.808
And I will still love you, no matter what.

00:46:01.834 --> 00:46:03.127
Remember that.

00:46:04.212 --> 00:46:05.230
But what if

00:46:05.254 --> 00:46:06.254
Jay,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.383
don't overthink.

00:46:09.384 --> 00:46:10.927
We'll figure this out.

00:46:14.722 --> 00:46:15.722
Come here.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:29.486
Jay

00:46:30.412 --> 00:46:31.747
can I kiss you again?

00:46:39.561 --> 00:46:40.561
Uhm,

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.520
I'll just get a new band-aid for you.

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:43.751
I'll come back.

00:46:53.469 --> 00:46:55.296
How stupid of you, Jay-jay!

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.557
Can I slap you, just once!

00:46:58.057 --> 00:46:59.076
What are you doing?

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.476
It's a mess already!

00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:30.715
We're here.

00:47:32.919 --> 00:47:34.254
Thanks for today, Jay.

00:47:34.593 --> 00:47:35.593
I had fun.

00:47:36.012 --> 00:47:37.013
Thank you, too.

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:44.579
Uhm, see you tomorrow.

00:47:44.604 --> 00:47:45.622
I'll pick you up again.

00:47:45.646 --> 00:47:46.957
Oh, don't!

00:47:46.981 --> 00:47:48.208
No need.

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.460
Ci-N and I will go together.

00:47:49.484 --> 00:47:50.777
He still doesn't know yet.

00:47:51.363 --> 00:47:52.211
Okay,

00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:53.666
maybe next time.

00:47:54.155 --> 00:47:55.156
I'll go ahead, Jay.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.367
Take care going home.

00:48:11.881 --> 00:48:12.882
Oh!

00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:29.057
Why are you here?

00:48:31.692 --> 00:48:32.669
Get in.

00:48:32.693 --> 00:48:33.505
Huh?

00:48:33.529 --> 00:48:34.612
Where are we going?

00:49:17.613 --> 00:49:18.990
Where are we?

00:49:21.409 --> 00:49:22.785
What did you and Yuri do?

00:49:26.706 --> 00:49:27.683
We

00:49:27.707 --> 00:49:29.125
Went to church.

00:49:30.418 --> 00:49:31.419
What else?

00:49:34.297 --> 00:49:36.299
We went grocery shopping, we cooked...

00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:38.616
What else?

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.721
We talked, and we also
looked at pictures.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.182
What else?

00:49:47.268 --> 00:49:48.620
Nothing else.

00:49:48.644 --> 00:49:50.062
What else?

00:49:51.105 --> 00:49:52.565
Nothing else.

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.777
Don't lie to me, please.

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:01.532
We

00:50:05.286 --> 00:50:06.996
He kissed me.

00:50:10.166 --> 00:50:11.584
Keifer...

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:14.337
Why are you doing this to me, Jay?

00:50:16.088 --> 00:50:17.340
I'm yours.

00:50:18.507 --> 00:50:19.592
You're mine.

00:50:20.343 --> 00:50:22.094
Why are you doing this to me?

00:50:22.678 --> 00:50:23.763
Keifer

00:50:25.348 --> 00:50:27.600
you know my situation.

00:50:27.892 --> 00:50:30.061
Please don't make this harder for me.

00:50:31.854 --> 00:50:33.022
Do you like Yuri?

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.115
Do you like Yuri?

00:50:46.077 --> 00:50:47.078
Yes!

00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:54.794
That's why I accepted the engagement!

00:50:55.495 --> 00:50:56.495
Liar!

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.464
I'm not lying.

00:50:58.839 --> 00:51:01.467
Then why did you respond to
my kiss on New Year's Eve?

00:51:03.344 --> 00:51:05.513
Why did you come here with me?

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.263
Huh?

00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:09.099
What am I to you?!

00:51:10.518 --> 00:51:11.644
What am I to you, Jay?!

00:51:14.397 --> 00:51:15.856
Tell me that night was a lie.

00:51:16.649 --> 00:51:17.649
Say it.

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:20.820
Tell me that it meant nothing to you!

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:23.882
Tell me and I'll leave you alone!

00:51:23.906 --> 00:51:25.199
Fine!

00:51:26.659 --> 00:51:28.202
Okay, fine!

00:51:29.499 --> 00:51:31.376
I'm not sure about what I feel,

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:34.141
but this is what's right, it should be Yuri!

00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:36.252
Because of that fucking engagement?

00:51:37.104 --> 00:51:39.398
That's what's right, Keifer!

00:51:41.215 --> 00:51:43.860
I can't stand thinking
about or seeing Yuri hurt

00:51:43.884 --> 00:51:45.695
for the same reason.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.139
So even if I'm not sure,

00:51:48.556 --> 00:51:50.993
even if I can't get you out of my head,

00:51:51.017 --> 00:51:53.203
even if I know my heart
has a different answer,

00:51:53.227 --> 00:51:54.979
I'm holding myself back!

00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:57.898
I want to experience being happy.

00:52:00.192 --> 00:52:01.527
Yuri again?

00:52:07.241 --> 00:52:08.281
Why?

00:52:09.452 --> 00:52:10.452
Jay,

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:11.973
do you really think

00:52:11.997 --> 00:52:14.040
I'm the one who always gets chosen?

00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:16.541
Hmm?

00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:20.897
Do you think I was the first
one they cared about

00:52:20.921 --> 00:52:22.590
when we got into that accident?

00:52:23.716 --> 00:52:25.569
They said he should be the priority,

00:52:25.593 --> 00:52:27.094
because he's the weaker one.

00:52:29.096 --> 00:52:30.181
What about me?

00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:37.104
Did any of you ever think that

00:52:37.897 --> 00:52:39.648
maybe I'm not as strong?

00:52:40.983 --> 00:52:43.027
Me, huh?

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.488
Who grew up without a mom.

00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:48.741
Was abandoned by my dad.

00:52:49.325 --> 00:52:52.369
And who raised my siblings
on my fucking own.

00:52:53.579 --> 00:52:55.557
Did any of you ever think

00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:56.749
if I was okay?

00:52:58.959 --> 00:53:00.020
Stop it...

00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:01.045
And now you?

00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:05.466
Please don't be like them, Jay.

00:53:08.177 --> 00:53:09.177
Please.

00:53:09.512 --> 00:53:10.763
Not you, too.

00:53:12.264 --> 00:53:13.264
No.

00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:14.891
Not me.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.186
Not me.

00:53:33.828 --> 00:53:35.746
I don't care about anything else.

00:53:37.289 --> 00:53:38.791
Let them choose Yuri.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:43.462
Just don't let me lose you too.

00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:47.299
I love you, Jay.

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.098
What Keifer said wasn't a question.

00:53:54.932 --> 00:53:56.976
But I already knew the answer.

00:54:02.356 --> 00:54:04.275
I love you too, Keifer.

00:55:28.234 --> 00:55:29.586
Good night.

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.364
I love you, to infinity and beyond.

00:55:33.739 --> 00:55:35.699
I love

00:55:36.158 --> 00:55:36.886
me!

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:38.053
- Who's that?
- Huh, where?

00:55:38.077 --> 00:55:40.829
You said I love you, I love you huh!

00:55:41.413 --> 00:55:42.323
He's absent.

00:55:42.348 --> 00:55:44.643
Keifer's not going to school today
if he's the one you're looking for.

00:55:44.667 --> 00:55:46.394
Huh, what do I care about him?

00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:47.520
Did that man come here?

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.921
Keiren! Where's Keiren?

00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:50.214
Where did you go?

00:55:51.382 --> 00:55:52.382
Fuck!

00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:56.095
You lost again to that Hanamitchi kid.

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:57.948
They're just kids!

00:55:57.972 --> 00:55:59.431
You're spoiling that kid!

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.101
That habit will stick with him
for the rest of his life!

00:56:03.477 --> 00:56:05.980
Serina, where the hell are you?!

00:56:06.647 --> 00:56:08.416
That's my money, it's not yours!

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.918
Remember this!

00:56:09.942 --> 00:56:11.402
I'm the one who's in charge!

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:13.129
Are you Jasper Jean Mariano?

00:56:13.153 --> 00:56:14.947
The Watson Family is asking for you.

00:56:15.406 --> 00:56:16.383
Are you all complete?

00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:17.408
Sign this.

00:56:18.492 --> 00:56:19.910
I'm not signing anything!

00:56:22.871 --> 00:56:23.580
No!

00:56:23.622 --> 00:56:24.623
Keifer!!!

00:56:24.873 --> 00:56:26.458
Go on, pull that trigger.
