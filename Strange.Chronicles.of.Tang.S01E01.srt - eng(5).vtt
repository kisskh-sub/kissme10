That's exactly what I was wondering.

What exactly is the Crimson Decree

Crimson Decree?

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.840
The truth is, I don't fully
understand it myself.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360
I only heard about it back

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
when I was roaming the Ghost Market.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.190
I really did just hear it in passing.

This assassin group
called Crimson Pact

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.650
The Crimson Decree

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.120
is their highest-level summons,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.850
issued to killers

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.470
within the organization.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
My take is this:

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.960
Silent Ember

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
is past seventy,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.330
yet he still took this recent risk.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.680
He likely aimed to accept the mission

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.710
to be issued via the Crimson Decree,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.750
to prove he remains

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.190
the world's foremost assassin.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.480
So what is this assassination mission?

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.670
I have no idea about that either.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.070
And I wouldn't dare to guess.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.600
Alright,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.550
stop keeping us in suspense.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.680
It might be a coincidence,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.160
but look at the record:
the Crimson Decree has only

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.800
ever been issued in years
of court upheaval.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.390
For example,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.330
the first year of Shenlong,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.390
of Jinglong,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.190
and of Tanglong.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.000
And this year in Chang'an…

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.930
there's been something very strange
about the weather.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.190
Your Majesty.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.160
Why does this taste different?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.700
On my own initiative,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.600
I added some ophiopogon root, poria,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.860
and wild jujube seeds.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And for what reason?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.600
In ancient times, when King Wen of Zhou
divinated the hexagrams,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.830
he would bathe and change
into fresh robes first.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.600
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon
also states:

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.330
"When the yang qi is exhausted,
one should rest."

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.920
Your Majesty, burdened by court documents
day after day,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.360

than four hours each night.

is the very foundation of the state.

I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.159
I commanded you to prepare
that gastrodia powder

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.550
for the precise purpose of sustaining
my alertness to govern.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.950
I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.480
do not need any sleep-inducing remedies.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.830
But Your Majesty, you understand
the consequences better than I—

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.560
to persist in this exhaustion…

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.780
it cannot go on.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.460
Your intentions were for my good.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.000
You may rise.

Moonlight washes over the tiles,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.040
dew turns the steps to silver—

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.750
a fitting moment for the spirit
to roam the Great Purity.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.270
Your Majesty, these hands
that govern the realm must,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.730
now and then,
know the fragrance of a pillow.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.480
Do you think I can simply sleep

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.430
if I wish?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.680
Do you believe my worries

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.460
lie only within these memorials?

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.920
If preparing the gastrodia powder

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.630
twice daily is a burden to you,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.320
you are free to cease.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.870
To serve even one day
at Your Majesty's side

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.600
is a blessing

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.950
accrued over lifetimes.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.930
have me driven from the gates—

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.290

will rub off on us.

Now this is the kind of robe

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.280
that befits a man of my standing!

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.120
No buttons?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.240
That shopkeeper duped me again!

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.790
But it really doesn't have any patches,

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.780
and it was cheap.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.130
Good, very good.

Who goes there?

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.600
State your name.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.480
I'm Sheng,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.910
and I'm here to report a crime.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.640
Look at this.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.670
A blood letter?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.360
Rel...

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.750
It could be Rel or Xia.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.020
Maybe it's someone's name.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.790
The unwritten part that follows

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.390
could be that person's name.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.980
It makes sense.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.150
This looks like a matter
of life and death.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.410
How much is this worth?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.610
First, tell me,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.920
where did you

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.200
find this note?

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.000
Here,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.200
here—

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.000
it was hidden right here.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.510
This robe isn't yours?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.200
Yes, it is.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.870
I bought it today
at a secondhand store.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.270
Was the button

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.910
already missing at purchase?

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.950
Never was!

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.910
I was just on my way

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.310
to return it for a refund!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.730
So… how much is this case worth?

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.240
You're so fond of money—

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.390
this note wasn't something

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.200
No,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.150
no, not at all!

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.870
I, Sheng, am a man

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.840
who owns property in Chang'an.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.270
I wouldn't dare trick the district office.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.330
Then let me ask you:

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.750
where exactly did you buy this robe?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.200
Lady Hong's Secondhand Store.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.630
It's at the north of Linghua Temple.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.510
So,

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.000
how much is the case really worth?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.800
Could you spare a little reward?

This looks like a plea for help
written in blood.

The last character is incomplete—

judging from what we have,
it could be "summer",

or perhaps "woes".

Yes.

You'll need to leave the robe here

as evidence.

It should stay.

from that secondhand store too?
