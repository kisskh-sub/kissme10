but it takes 11 hours.

I even found one
that takes 22 hours to walk.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.613
That drone's ours, right?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.848
Yeah, it is.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.683
TIME FOR SOME PHOTOS

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.918
You don't need to look.

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.721
[both laugh]

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.556
Perfect right now.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.191
It looks natural.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.726
Perfect. My gosh.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.027
-Take one for me.
-Okay.

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:15.095
The same way.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.196
-Okay.
-Look.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.330
And then...

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.166
[chuckles]

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.070
I saw this on YouTube.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:26.539
You take it like this,
it comes out naturally.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:27.841
Hold on.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:28.942
Naturally?

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.544
This gives you a natural shot,
YouTube says.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:35.448
[Jimin] That's nice.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.517
[Jung Kook] Let's go grab
something to drink.

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:38.585
[Jimin] Okay.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.653
[producer] Should we buy you something?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.722
-Sure.
-[producer] What do you want?

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.258
Do they have tea? Like mint? Herb mint?

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.559
Just water for me.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.061
-[producer] Water?
-Yes.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.496
They're really good.

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:51.898
Now that's skill.

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:53.500
[Jimin] Right.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.135
If I try to go that slow?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.103
I end up sinking like this.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.105
[muttering]

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.441
PASSING BY

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.243
[in English] Bless you.

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:04.978
[in Korean] So cute.

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:06.746
Adorable.

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:08.114
You can't stay still there.

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.483
-It wasn't salty when I tasted it.
-Thank you.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.651
Pour this in...

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.953
Isn't the ice gonna melt?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.689
AS THE ICE MELTS, THE DRINK SPILLS TOO

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:17.924
Hey, quiet.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.161
It's nice and cool.

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:23.763
Uh-huh.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:24.864
It's good.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.203
A PEACEFUL HEALING MOMENT
BETWEEN GREEN AND BLUE

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.839
[Jung Kook] It's really nice.
You feel more relaxed here.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.975
[Jimin] I want to try that.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.277
Doesn't look too hard.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.345
The water's calm, maybe it's doable.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.082
-Since you came all the way here...
-Yes.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.149
RANDOM DRAW

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:44.651
[Jimin] I'm fine with anything.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.019
[producer] One, two, three.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.555
We'll go by the order
of the KakaoTalk messages.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.756
We won't change it.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.258
Then psychologically,
number two seems the safest.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:53.793
-Psychologically...
-[Jimin] Two.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.564
I think they probably sent
something unusual for number three.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.334
But I think number two would
be neutral and safe.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.969
Yeah, something average.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.171
-You're good.
-[producer] PD Hana.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:07.140
Show us the messages in order.

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:10.043
-Either one or three must be the best.
-Right.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.911
-It's a 50-50.
-Right, right.

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.213
Number two's not bad.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.747
-Number two's the safest.
-Yes.

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.549
We'll go with number two.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.650
One, two, three.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:18.718
-Number 2.
-Number 2.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.920
Okay, I'll show you.
I swear I'm not lying.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.555
Number two.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.657
Number three.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.227
Hey, number two is the worst one.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.328
Let's go.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.430
HEADING INTO THE BLUE LAKE

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.765
MAKING A GRAND ENTRANCE

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.734
Where is it? Here?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.902
Where is it?

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.037
We just go down?

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:40.173
We ended up really going.

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.176
DIFFERENT FROM THE PHOTO

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:44.444
[Jung Kook] It's smaller.

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:50.617
Whoa, that's cold.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.418
SUDDENLY GOES IN THE WATER

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.853
[Jung Kook] Why did you go in?

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.826
All right, let's go.

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:01.127
All right, let's go.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.499
RUSHES BACK FOR FEAR OF BEING LEFT BEHIND

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.035
Once you're in, you really feel it.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.670
-Cold?
-Your body won't float.

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:16.576
JIMIN GETS ON BOARD FIRST

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:20.513
BOARDED SAFELY UNDER EXPERT GUIDANCE

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.650
CAREFULLY SETS OFF

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:24.784
Let's go.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.919
WOBBLY WOBBLE

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.021
Whoa, this is tricky. It's tricky.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.658
Relax, Jimin. Just relax.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.395
RELAXED AND SLOWLY FINDING HIS BALANCE

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.863
It's better now.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.634
QUICKLY GOT THE HANG OF IT

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.469
Seriously, it's so beautiful.

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.443
Let's try going to that island.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.778
I really wanna go there.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.646
JIMIN ENJOYING THE SCENERY

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.750
A STRANGE NOISE IS HEARD FROM BEHIND

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.818
[exclaims]

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.255
JUNG KOOK MAKING A LOUD, DRAMATIC START

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:07.794
POPPIN' PADDLING BEGINS

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.995
Where are you going?

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:10.863
Where am I going?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:11.998
Why won't this turn?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.369
Jung Kook, come here.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.605
BLAZING A NEW TRAIL

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.073
I can't change directions.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.475
Let's go forward.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.881
IN THE END, HE HAS A ONE-ON-ONE LESSON

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:32.185
FOCUSED MODE ON

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.021
BORN ATHLETE LEARNS INSTANTLY

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.889
Okay.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.291
BACK ON TRACK

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.359
Jimin.

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:41.761
Jimin, wait for me.

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:43.963
Jimin.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.902
-Jimin.
-Yes, come on.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.304
[Jimin] This is so much fun.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.405
I'm loving this.

00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:54.874
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.410
-Here for a getaway?
-Oh, nothing fancy.

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:59.412
-I see.
-Yeah.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:01.247
-It's fun.
-Right?

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:03.549
A PEACEFUL TRIP ACROSS THE EMERALD LAKE

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:07.954
[exclaiming]

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:11.024
SMOOTH PARKING

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.727
ARRIVED AT THE DIVING SPOT

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.862
So then...

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:16.929
TYING IT UP

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:18.298
Like this.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.733
What, are you tying it? You are?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.135
Yeah.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.269
Tying it where?

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.238
I'm tying it to the front.

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:27.407
But it's a bit short.

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:29.742
Mine's all tied up.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.344
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'LL WORK

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:35.181
FIX IT WITH MUSCLES

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:36.316
Just lift it up.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.951
Oh, right, that works too.

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.522
It's nothing, really, Jimin.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:44.490
That's good. All right.

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.260
[whoops]

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.695
All right.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:52.699
SPLASHING INTO THE LAKE
THAT LOOKS SO REFRESHING

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:53.766
Jimin.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:55.802
That was awesome.

00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:01.140
POV: FROM THE LAKE ITSELF

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:04.510
You filthy little rascal.

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.412
UNTYING THE PADDLEBOARD

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:09.282
You filthy little rascal.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.552
Damn it.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.488
LOST THE PADDLEBOARD RIGHT BEFORE HIS EYES

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:19.392
QUICK GETAWAY

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:22.228
-He's just leaving like that?
-[producer] It seems so.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.697
-Goodbye, then!
-[Jimin all laughing]

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.270
CASUALLY ENJOYING THE MOMENT

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:34.507
Is this a declaration of war?

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:37.210
DANGER DETECTED

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:41.581
JIMIN CLOSING IN FAST

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:45.785
SUDDEN CHASE BEGINS

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.257
[Jimin] Oh, you're fast as expected.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.194
GAP BETWEEN THEM KEEPS GROWING

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:58.498
JIMIN, KO

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.468
-Jimin.
-Yes.

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:04.771
Why were you chasing me?

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.039
I wasn't even chasing that hard.

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.808
I went after you once.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.410
You're mistaken.

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:19.552
MISCHIEF MODE ON

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:22.021
Such dirty tricks you play.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.892
I could totally push you in the water
with full force.

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.361
GETS PUSHED JUST LIKE THAT

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.464
A BITTER ENDING

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.132
[Jimin] That was fun.

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.301
It was so relaxing and peaceful.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.003
[in English] Let's get in the car.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.871
[laughing]

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.379
[Jung Kook] Let's go to eat some burgers.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.447
[Jimin] Let's go.

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:54.921
[in Korean] It's amazing that there's
a whole village up in the mountains.

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.256
-Like something out of a fairy tale.
-Yeah.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.692
[Jimin] I feel like
I'm inside a storybook.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:02.695
So far away from modern life.

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:06.132
Honestly, I want to live
somewhere like this when I get old.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.268
I remember feeling something
similar once before.

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.370
Remember when we went to Sweden?

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.040
I really loved that trip.

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.275
I've always wanted to go back there.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.110
But this place isn't losing either.

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.178
GREAT START

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:22.081
-[Jung Kook] If you're happy, that's good.
-I love it here.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:26.118
A DAY IN SWITZERLAND THAT WE WILL

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.588
SUDDENLY REMEMBER SOMEDAY

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.358
[Jimin] It's over there.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.227
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Barger's.

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:35.628
Perfect. We can eat outside.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:36.762
-Yeah.
-Good find.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.265
This place looks really good.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.399
This burger shop?

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:43.536
They say it's so good,
it's worth coming back here.

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:44.804
It's close, right?

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:46.038
Closest one from here.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.206
-Let's go here.
-Here?

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:48.274
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.642
-20 mins from here?
-Yeah.

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:51.077
That's close.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.311
Excuse me.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.379
WITH EXCITEMENT

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.114
It's the same menu we saw.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.850
I think this must be the original.

00:16:57.917 --> 00:16:59.318
And they have chicken.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.553
And ham.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.954
This one's the classic.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.856
-Barger's burgers.
-We should get

00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:05.858
-the top one. Let's get this.
-Yeah.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.727
I'll take the cheese one. Wait.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:08.895
I'll go with the same.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.163
-[Jung Kook in English] Can I order?
-Order? Yes.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.899
BURGER ORDER: COMPLETE

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:14.667
-Okay.
-[Jimin in English] Thank you.

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:16.168
[in Korean] Let's grab a seat.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:17.937
This is nice.

00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:19.972
[in Korean] I can't wait to eat
that burger.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.107
I'm starving.

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:23.643
When's it coming? I'm hungry.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:28.381
THE LONG-AWAITED BURGERS HAVE ARRIVED

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:32.218
MOUTHWATERING PRESENTATION

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.686
[Jimin humming]

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:38.691
I'm digging in.

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:45.965
Go ahead.

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:47.533
Why is it so good?

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:49.368
Let me try.

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:51.737
THRILL OF THE FIRST BITE

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:52.805
I'm excited.

00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:56.375
Why are the buns so thick?

00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.211
FURROWED BROWS OF TRUTH

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.250
[both] Mmm!

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:06.953
THUMBS UP

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.220
-It's good.
-Yeah.

00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:09.956
Way too good.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.691
Mmm!

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.758
BURGER

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:13.926
TRULY

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.161
DELICIOUS

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.863
SO GOOD, HE WANTS TO TELL EVERY CAMERA

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.166
This is so good.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.101
What a great find.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:25.771
I'm coming back here just for this burger.

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:27.740
Hey, here.

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:28.841
OFFERING FRIES

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.812
Here, you're not eating?

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:33.980
I'm taking it, then.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:37.950
You see,
it's because you're not one with nature.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:41.520
GENTLY IN SYNC WITH NATURE

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.255
TAKING THE FRIES

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.323
The bird took it.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.525
You're not supposed
to come off as threatening.

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:47.593
ANOTHER ONE ARRIVES

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.661
Again?

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:51.063
Succeed this time.

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:54.467
FLIES OFF RIGHT BEFORE HIM

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.668
Wow, how rude.

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.671
It flew right over us.

00:18:58.738 --> 00:18:59.972
ANGRY AT THE SPARROW

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.308
You...

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.945
Don't fly over people
while they're eating, okay?

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:07.246
-Success.
-[Jimin] Success?

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.814
-Success.
-That one's clever.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.250
THERE WAS A BURGER...

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.518
NOW IT'S GONE

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.021
I'll just pay with mine first.

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.522
-Oh, for mine too?
-Yeah.

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:17.623
Or with your money?

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.724
SNEAKY SMILE

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:19.792
What the heck?

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.229
Why is there yours and mine?

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.930
-There isn't.
-Yeah.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.501
My money is your money,
and your money is mine.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.536
What's with that suspicious grin?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.038
Just trust me.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.741
A SMILE THAT INSPIRES ZERO TRUST

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:36.909
Let's go pay.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:39.912
44 FRANCS PAID

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:41.147
Thank you very much.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.516
[in English] Really delicious.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:44.583
WET WIPES

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.985
-Thank you.
-Come again.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:49.388
-[in English] Thank you. It was good.
-Thank you.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:52.191
[in Korean] Wait, what? For hands?
I thought it was a snack.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.060
What should we do now?

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.063
[Jimin in Korean] Jung Kook, make pasta.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:59.131
-Is it three minutes away?
-Yeah.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.968
Oh, very smooth.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.104
[Jimin] We need oil?

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:08.007
[Jung Kook] Yeah, olive oil and garlic.

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:10.309
And something spicy, like chili pepper.

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:13.045
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:17.483
We're buying groceries for dinner tonight.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.618
[Jung Kook] Canned whole tomatoes.

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:22.121
There's basil... Yeah, it's this one.

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:23.189
It's pricey.

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.257
-We can spend three for that.
-We can.

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:26.892
We still have enough.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.895
This one's perfect. Good.

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.564
Can you add that spicy pepper?

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.998
-Peperoncino?
-Yeah.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.800
It'd be great to have that.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:36.736
A small one probably would be enough.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:38.771
My gosh.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:40.706
It'll work, right?

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:43.375
Where did Jimin go?

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.046
ON A QUEST TO FIND PEPERONCINO

00:20:47.113 --> 00:20:49.882
Not sure, but I want to find it
and get a compliment.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:52.017
Huh? Oh, this doesn't look right.

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:54.954
[in English] Excuse me.

00:20:55.054 --> 00:20:57.790
-[woman] Hello.
-Where is the red pepper?

00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.126
ASKING STAFF FOR HELP

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:03.095
FOUND IT WITH STAFF'S HELP

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.698
-Very kind.
-Have a nice trip.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.299
Oh, thank you.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.235
SHOWS IT OFF IMMEDIATELY

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.270
Oh, this one looks good.

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:13.906
I think this will work.

00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:15.674
[in Korean] I tried hard to find it.

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:17.343
PROUD MOMENT

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.578
Do they not sell milk here?

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.413
Well, I don't work here, so...

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.149
Garlic, veggies...

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:25.818
-Right, we'll need those too.
-Yeah.

00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:28.053
I'll go find them.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.055
JIMIN SETS OFF AGAIN

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.024
That's too much. Way too much.

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:34.226
Small one. We don't need that much.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.662
SOMETHING SMALLER?

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.831
OR MAYBE THIS ONE?

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:39.899
Let's go with this.

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:45.271
We need to get garlic and onions.
Or shallots.

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.506
Jung Kook said we need shallots.

00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:49.775
Why are there so many types of garlic?

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:52.244
A single bulb?
But we don't need that much.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.013
Actually, we might need a lot.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.614
-Jung Kook?
-Yes.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:56.782
Take a look at this.

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.250
Is this it?

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.785
Shallots? Yep, that's it.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:03.522
SHALLOTS &amp; GARLIC: CHECKED

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.291
SWEEPING UP MORE INGREDIENTS

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:06.392
Just random stuff?

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.459
We gotta eat.

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:09.461
Just go for it. Confidence is key.

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.363
But if this exceeds 50 francs...

00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:13.332
It won't.

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:15.234
I kept track of all items.

00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:16.869
TIME TO CHECK OUT

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:22.308
INGREDIENTS JUST KEEP COMING OUT

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:24.543
Oh, I forgot to include the pasta.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.145
Huh?

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:27.947
Pasta isn't that expensive.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:31.717
Hold on.
Let's put in the essentials first.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:35.988
WILL IT STAY UNDER 50 FRANCS?

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:37.756
[Jimin] Wow, it's spot on.

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.091
[Jung Kook] Perfect.

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:40.426
[Jimin] It's perfect.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.228
This is adulting.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:43.863
A TRUE DISPLAY OF ADULTING

00:22:43.963 --> 00:22:46.532
-Thank you very much. Bye!
-[in English] Thank you.

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:48.367
[in Korean] No shopping bag for us?

00:22:49.168 --> 00:22:52.504
I grabbed this from the veggie section.
Let's use it.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:55.441
A MOMENT AGO

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:56.809
I pulled out three...

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.177
BY MISTAKE

00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:00.112
-Oh, this works.
-Let's use it.

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:02.615
Let's fit what we can. The squishy stuff.

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:05.084
It's gonna rip.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.685
-We've got one more.
-One more.

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.687
Frugal. So frugal.

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:13.759
[Jung Kook] Oh, 49 francs.
Nailed it. We did great.

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:15.861
-Let's carry them from here.
-Yeah.

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:18.230
We really saved a lot.

00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:20.132
We even have change.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.002
GETTING 1 FRANC BACK FROM THE CART

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.103

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:26.472
-[Jimin] Takes 20 minutes?
-Yeah, looks like it.

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:28.674
Man, I just wanna shower and lie down.

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:29.975
I actually have to.

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:32.244
But the lake water was so clean.

00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:34.380
-It doesn't feel gross. Yeah.
-Right?

00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:36.615
If it were seawater, it would.

00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:38.183
-Definitely.
-Right.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.052
I'd have salt powder on my body.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.022
PICKING SONGS FOR THE DRIVE

00:23:45.324 --> 00:23:46.325
I know this.

-Right?
-Nope.

00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:54.533
What? Isn't it "FAKE LOVE"?

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.734
Correct.

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:59.138

I know. "Boy With Luv."

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:05.978
Correct.

00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:13.085
It's not our song.

00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:14.420
Then I can't guess it.

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:16.722
I'm sorry.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.024
I'm sorry.

A BITTERSWEET MOMENT

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.562
Sorry about that, Jung Kook.

We're here.

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:30.903
ARRIVED AT THE LODGE

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.005
[Jung Kook] We should put this
in the fridge.

00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:34.406
[Jimin] I'll put it away.

CHEESE

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.947
This is kind of a loophole.

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:45.451
Free stuff.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.289

[Jung Kook] Shall we go? Another round?

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:59.832
-[Jimin] Gotta start with ping pong.
-Never thought we'd be playing that here.

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.935
Haven't played it for a while.
I'm getting fired up again.

I'm getting used to it.

We can go up to 6 francs.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.482
[producer] If you lose, you have
to give back the 6 francs.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.051
But if you win,

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:54.019

[Jimin] The wind blows that way.

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:04.997
Even light hits send it over.

00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:06.665
I'll use every dirty trick.

No, no.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:07.092
He's going to panic.
We've used lots of rackets.

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:09.361
This one's the most confusing of them all.

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.762

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:01.933
LOSES ANOTHER POINT INSTANTLY

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.001
Is it my turn now?

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:04.336
-The score?
-Switch?

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.271
Is it 9-7?

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:07.806
It's Jung Kook Time.

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:08.974
BORN IN 1997

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:12.477
97 JUNG KOOK TIME ENDS

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.946
FELT MORE LIKE 0.97 SECONDS

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.048
MATCH POINT

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:17.382
[Jung Kook] Jimin.

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:18.517
Should we switch?

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.851
Are you confident?

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.553
Yeah, I'll try.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.755
-Going for the comeback.
-[Jimin] Okay.

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.458
That's the spirit.
Ping pong's all about that.

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.695
ONE LAST POINT TO END IT ALL

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.564
FULL-POWER SMASH

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:34.733
GAME OVER

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.169
[man] I'm sorry.

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:38.770
I'll go get the ball.

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:40.405
6 FRANCS

00:30:40.472 --> 00:30:41.473
6 FRANCS FLY AWAY

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.041
[Jimin] There'll be another game.

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:44.209
-[Jung Kook] Jimin.
-Yes?

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:45.877
Four-love was a bit... [laughs]

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.212
Want to play a game?

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:49.247
-I won, remember?
-Want to bet 10 francs?

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.449
Thank you.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.017
BOW TO THE DIRECTOR

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:55.887
-Congrats.
-[Jung Kook] A match is a match.

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.189
You're really good.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.326
-[Jimin] When are we eating?
-Let's just eat now.

00:31:01.393 --> 00:31:03.528
If you don't want to cook, don't have to.

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.064
No, I like my own cooking.

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:07.199
Oh?

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.567
Same here.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.402
I like your cooking too.

00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:11.570
Thanks, man.

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.805
-[Jimin] How many do we peel?
-A lot.

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:14.906
Shallots too. A lot.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.709
Huh? This one peeled so well.

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:18.877
Just do it roughly.

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.216
Stop inspecting everything.

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:26.084
Here, I'll prep the shallots.

00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:28.620
Here, you do one.
I'll take the smallest one.

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:30.589
Okay, cut it in half first.

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:37.195
CHEF JUNG KOOK'S PROFESSIONAL CHOPPING

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.563
Slicing straight down?

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.965
Where? Here?

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.600
Your hand position is wrong.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:44.669
Jimin, stop shaking and just go.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.506
Why are you standing next to me trembling?

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.607
How about garlic?

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.076
Garlic's actually dangerous. Please go.

00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:52.244
Bring it on.

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:55.046
FLASHY KNIFE SKILLS

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.681
CONFIDENTLY FOLLOWING ALONG

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:59.918
THE BEGINNER STRIKES BACK

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.354
Just go.

00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:04.055
That looked pretty good, huh?

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.926
It must've looked impressive from behind.

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:12.364
Stop trying to match the rhythm.

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.606
Jimin, you're funny.

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:25.343
[Jung Kook laughing]

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:29.448
REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.716
Jimin, just cut the garlic
however you want.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:32.784
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.620
[Jimin] Darn it.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.922
[Jung Kook laughs]

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:39.958
[Jimin] It's embarrassing.

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.161
BUT GIVING UP ISN'T MY THING

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:46.698
STARTS INTENSE GARLIC SLICING PRACTICE

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:49.501
BECOMING A SLICING MASTER

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.506
That persistence is impressive, Jimin.

00:32:54.573 --> 00:32:56.575
I've gotten this far on persistence.

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.376
GARLIC SLICING COMPLETE

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.213
All right, I'm leaving now.
My work here is done.

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:04.416
Yep, great job.
I'll make you a delicious dish.

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.017
EARNED HIS ONE SERVING

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.085
Exit.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.788
PASTA-MAKING BEGINS

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:12.524
HEATS OLIVE OIL

00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:14.292
ADDS GARLIC SLICED BY JIMIN

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.527
He cut it nicely.

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:19.164
Let the garlic cook slowly on low heat.

00:33:20.265 --> 00:33:22.067
DROPS A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF PASTA

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.169
You need to stir it in the beginning.

00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:26.004
Or it'll stick to the bottom.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.475
EYES ON THE REMAINING PASTA

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:31.943
Should I just use it all?

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.111
Would it be too much?

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:34.846
Is it too late?

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.350
Whatever.

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.952
DUMPS IT ALL IN

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.854
Whatever. It'll work out.

00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:46.725
It'll be half al dente, half fully cooked.

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.159
Loads of shallots.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.595
SPRINKLES SALT &amp; PEPPER

00:33:50.662 --> 00:33:51.930
FOR EVEN COOKING

00:33:51.997 --> 00:33:53.565
Bring out the sweetness.

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:56.201
ADDS CREAMY MILK

00:33:57.836 --> 00:33:59.671
That's a lot of noodles.

00:33:59.738 --> 00:34:01.206
I'll eat it all for you.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:03.008
FINISHING TOUCH: BASIL

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:05.243
[Jung Kook] Thick and creamy.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.411
CHEESE

00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:07.479
PEPPER

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:08.547
OLIVE OIL

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.583
JUNG KOOK'S BASIL CREAM PASTA COMPLETE

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.685
It's truly an honor, Jung Kook.

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:14.786
Let me try it.

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:15.854
TAKES A BITE

00:34:18.857 --> 00:34:20.759
THIS IS...!

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.527
EYES POP WIDE OPEN

00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:24.629
Doesn't it make you crave beer?

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:26.865
You seriously cook so fast now.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.870
Wow.

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:33.138
Hey, what is this?

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:34.940
-[producer] This is delicious.
-Right.

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:36.541
It's so good. The pizza is good.

00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:38.877
GOOD FOOD IS MEANT TO BE SHARED

00:34:38.944 --> 00:34:41.613
After tasting Jung Kook's cooking,
I can't eat this.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.248
-What is it?
-Tomato pasta.

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:47.886
TRYING THE LOCAL TOMATO PASTA

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.854
Yeah, mine is better.

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:51.856
There's a 100,000 won difference.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:54.793
I'll take this one.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.728
TAKES THE LAST NOODLE STRAND

00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:58.430
It's just too good.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.764
Seriously.

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:02.000
Wow, I got two pieces of garlic.

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:03.268
That's your doing.

00:35:03.335 --> 00:35:04.536
Yep, I'll eat them all.

00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:08.673
STRAIGHT INTO THE MOUTH

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.741
[exclaims]

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:13.111
JUNG KOOK SUDDENLY DEEP IN THOUGHT

00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:15.180
Should I try making this pasta better?

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:16.414
[Jimin] Can you?

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.216
Now I'm curious.

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.652
[Jung Kook] Should I just try it?

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:24.389
What did it taste like?

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:27.626
ASSESSING THE PASTA'S CONDITION

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:29.728
DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:32.631
STARTS BOILING PASTA BROTH AGAIN

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.833
FULL RESUSCITATION BEGINS

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.668
Can you toss this in too?

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.536
-Yep.
-A little spicier?

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:41.840
ACCEPTS THE ASSISTANT'S SUGGESTION

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.808
PASTA REGAINING ITS SPIRIT

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:44.909
It looks tasty.

00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:49.581
This was us in the army.
Jung Kook cooked, I did the dishes.

00:35:50.215 --> 00:35:52.250
[Jung Kook] Pasta is all about cheese.

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.220
If you make it better, it'll be legendary.

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.355
It must be better than before, right?

00:35:58.323 --> 00:36:00.525
JUNG KOOK'S TOMATO PASTA, REBORN

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:02.427
Let's see if it worked.

00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:05.230
-Jung Kook. If it did,
-It might not have worked.

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:08.800
I'll brag about it wherever I go.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:11.069
"Have you ever revived
a convenience meal?"

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.171
I just added cheese.

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:14.339
"My bro did it."

00:36:14.406 --> 00:36:16.207
Just beat some cheese into it.

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.143
Dump in a ton of cheese, and boom.

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.513
DID THE FLAVOR COME BACK TO LIFE?

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:23.448
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:25.150
The flavor came back to life.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.052
I can't believe it worked.

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.653
PASTA REVIVED BY A MASTER

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.322
This is wild. It actually worked?

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:35.527
DEVOURING IT LIKE IT'S HIS FIRST TIME

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:36.628
Mmm.

00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:38.329
Seriously, this is good.

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.098
It was a good meal.

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:42.033
LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS MORE

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.069
SUDDENLY OPENS THE FRIDGE

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.137
Hey, save this one too.

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.205
FROM CONVENIENCE STORE

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:50.575
Save it for me.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.411
-You want to eat more?
-Make it better.

00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:56.247
What is this? Meat?

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:58.550
That thing looks like a rock.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.685
WHAT USED TO BE PASTA

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:02.153
Really going to eat it?

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.089
If you make it better, I will.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.924
DESPERATE PUPPY EYES

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.928
THE PASTA DOCTOR RISES AGAIN

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.963
WILL HE BE ABLE TO

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.998
REVIVE THE PASTA AGAIN?

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.668
Gosh, because of Jung Kook,
I can't even diet.

00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:17.836
What?

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:22.107
I keep breaking my promise to ARMY.

00:37:23.842 --> 00:37:26.344
I just had coffee for breakfast to diet,

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:28.113
then binge at night.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.248
WHILE JUNG KOOK ENJOYS BREAKFAST

00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:31.483
JUST SIPPING COFFEE

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:32.550
BUT THEN...

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:37.188
BINGE LIST
1. BURGER &amp; FRIES

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:40.992
2. BASIL CREAM PASTA

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:44.362
3. TOMATO PASTA

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.298
What a foodie, Jimin.

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:50.502
A little less delicious,
and I wouldn't have kept eating.

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:53.171
But how am I supposed to resist
when it's this good?

00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:55.273
HEHE

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.443
BACON, CPR KICKSTARTER

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.612
SAUTÉ IT

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:01.780
ADD THE PASTA

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:03.715
ADD MILK

00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:04.816
[Jung Kook] Done.

00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.017
Thank you, Jung Kook.

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:07.619
Much appreciated.

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:08.920
Whoa, that's creamy.

00:38:08.987 --> 00:38:10.789
All the water's gone.

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:13.892
HE ADDS AS MUCH CHEESE AS HE LIKES

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.727
CHEESE POURING LIKE A WATERFALL

00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:17.395
-[Jung Kook] Stop right there.
-Oh!

00:38:18.163 --> 00:38:20.832
FINISHED WITH A DASH OF PEPPER

00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:22.033
Oh, even pepper?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.535
It might not taste good though.

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.037
-Right.
-Let me see if it's also good.

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:28.006
-Honestly...
-I'll be the judge.

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:29.841
I'm nervous too. Why am I?

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:31.442
HEART SUDDENLY POUNDING

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.979
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THIS FIRST BITE

00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:39.684
A MEANINGFUL LOOK

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:42.954
GETTING NERVOUS TOO

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:49.294
YUP, IT'S DELICIOUS

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.296
SO GOOD, NO WORDS NEEDED

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.931
Give me some, I want a bite.

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:00.205
I shouldn't eat this with that.

00:39:00.972 --> 00:39:02.040
Mmm!

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.741
-Good, right?
-It's good.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.377
So the bacon does work.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.445
Yeah.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:10.448
It tastes different from the previous one.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:12.083
Like being at a restaurant

00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:15.587
and ordering three different pastas.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:19.824
FINAL BITE

00:39:19.891 --> 00:39:22.293
You're eating a lot.
Because you skipped breakfast?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.529
Back in the army, I used to feed Jimin.

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:26.831
He suggests we go on a diet.

00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:29.667
So I plan to just have lunch
and skip dinner,

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:32.537
but then he asks me if I want to eat.

00:39:32.604 --> 00:39:34.405
And I'm like, "Aren't we on a diet?"

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:36.074
Then he goes, "But I'm hungry."

00:39:37.242 --> 00:39:40.111
So he ends up taking me to eat together.

00:39:40.178 --> 00:39:41.813
Then since I'm full,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.782
I lie on my bunk like this,
and I don't see him.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.551
Turns out he went to work out.

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:49.320
I'm like, "How dare you go alone!"

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:51.322
And he's like, "We just ate."

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:52.690
NOTHING TO SAY

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.859
-You should've gone with me.
-Why only me...

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:58.062
I did that many times.
You should've come to work out.

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.899
While you did that,
our military service ended.

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:03.801
This was all
right before we were discharged.

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.036
Still, thanks, man.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.906
It's thanks to the garlic you chopped.

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.274
WARM AND FUZZY WRAP-UP

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.910
That was seriously good. Goodness.

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:16.147
A MEAL FILLED WITH HAPPINESS

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:20.652
Seriously, today I feel like
I was treated to a special meal.

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:23.054
[producer] You need money
to spend tomorrow.

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:24.622
-[Jimin] Yes.
-[Jung Kook] Right.

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.024
[producer] Let's play
yutnori.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.325
-[Jung Kook] Yutnori?
-Yes.

00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:29.027
We'll bet allowance money on it.

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:31.996
This time, 50 francs are on the line.

00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:33.831
-50 francs?
-How does that sound?

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.400
EYES TREMBLING WILDLY

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.368
You mean 50 francs for the whole day?

00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:39.304
Fifty each?

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.673
We spent 90 today, though.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.541
A single burger cost 20 francs.

00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:49.948
-Then, 100 francs in total.
-100 francs in total?

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:51.549
-Thank you.
-50 each.

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:52.650
-Sounds good.
-Yes.

00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:54.152
-50 each.
-Okay.

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:56.487
But I'm a god. A Yut God.

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:59.190
-Exactly.
-Call me the Yut God.

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:02.060
Please call me "Yut God the Best Of Me."

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.161
For this?

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.228
Yeah.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.165
TRAP YUTNORI WITH YUT GOD

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.266
BASIC TERMS

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:10.234
PIGGYBACK: PIGGYBACK THE TEAM'S TOKEN

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:13.104
CAPTURE: CATCH OPPONENT
AND GET ONE MORE THROW

00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:14.572
BACK-DO: MOVE BACK 1 SPACE

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.140
Let's each set just one trap.

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.376
We created such a fun game.

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.912
TRAP RULE: LAND ON A TRAP, GO BACK TO "DO"

00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.514
GENTLE SPOILER:
THE TRAPS WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:26.284
It's my first time
playing with traps, actually.

00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:30.121
So the Yut God might just turn human...

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:32.557
-Let's just do it.
-[producer] Who's going first?

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:33.624
-Me first?
-Okay.

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.726
Okay, me first?

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:35.860
-No.
-Why not?

00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:37.428
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Second.

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:38.496
No, be confident.

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:40.098
Our spirit's kind of low.

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:42.433
Come on, let's raise it.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.736
TRYING TO RAISE IT WITH HIS FACE

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.872
We lost at ping pong.

00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:49.574
Yeah, we're really off today.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.776
YELLOW: STAFF
GREEN: JIMIN &amp; JUNG KOOK

00:41:51.843 --> 00:41:52.910
Here we go.

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.345
STAFF GOES FIRST

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:55.413
Back-Do.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.481
Is it Back-Do?

00:41:57.315 --> 00:41:59.550
NO MOVES WHEN THERE'S
NO TOKEN ON THE BOARD

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.285
What do I need to get again?

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.754
Yut or Mo, right?

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.623
Honestly, anything's fine.
It's just the start.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.892
UNIQUE POSTURE

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:09.093
Is it not coming out?

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.595
GETS YUT ON THE FIRST TRY

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:11.662
Yut.

00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:15.967
FALLS INTO HIS OWN TRAP

00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:19.103
-You get another throw.
-Do, Gae.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.972
If you get Geol, that'd be funny.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:24.442
REFOCUS

00:42:24.509 --> 00:42:26.077
What if I get another Yut now?

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:27.478
That'd be perfect.

00:42:28.179 --> 00:42:29.447
Do.

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:31.449
That's Gae in the end.

00:42:31.516 --> 00:42:32.750
PRODUCTION TEAM

00:42:32.817 --> 00:42:34.085
-Do.
-Do.

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:35.953
YUT GOD'S FIRST TRY

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.121
We should catch it.

00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:38.289
We should catch it.

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:40.058
GETS MO, SO 1 EXTRA THROW

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.192
Do, Gae, Geol, Yut, Mo.

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:42.527
-Just throw again...
-Okay.

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:43.795
You can't place the token.

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.029
-No, no.
-You already did.

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:46.097
It's already placed.

00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:48.499
IS NO ONE ON OUR SIDE?

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:49.600
Aside from that...

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.569
Wow, did you see that?

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:53.938
So strict.

00:42:54.005 --> 00:42:55.640
We weren't supposed to place it.

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:58.576
If I get Do again, I could catch
and start from there.

00:42:58.643 --> 00:42:59.677
Really?

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:01.345
-Gae.
-Gae.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.580
Move forward?

00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:04.048
Go forward and throw again.

00:43:05.016 --> 00:43:06.451
Caught it. One more throw.

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:07.685
Extra for catching?

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:08.953
-Extra throw.
-Good.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.688
I told you I'm the Yut God.

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.023
-Geol.
-Geol.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.192
Go this way...

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.361
Piggyback? No, no.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.730
Hold on. Do, Gae, Geol.

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.567
-[Jimin] This is iffy. Very iffy.
-No, but...

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.036
Just leave it. Go back and...

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.737
-Go? Okay.
-Yeah.

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:29.974
This setup is hilarious.

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.778
-Mo.
-Whoa, this is...

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:36.314
-I figured it out now.
-Roll it, and...

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.182
-So sneaky.
-[Jung Kook] Wow.

00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:41.219
PRODUCTION TEAM: 2 MO

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.588
-I just threw it.
-Yeah, I saw it.

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.656
WHAT THE HECK?

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.526
2 MO, THEN DO

00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:49.594
Caught it.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.329
[Jung Kook] Wait. Did you piggyback?

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.764
DISPIRITED

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.066
Gotta roll fast.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.435
Mo.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.904
-One more time?
-We caught it.

00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:01.172
No, don't move it.

00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:02.673
Just roll fast.

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:05.610
-Maybe not?
-Gae.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:06.811
PROCEED THIS WAY

00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:08.513
-[Jung Kook] Catch it.
-Catch it.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.981
-Gae.
-There you go.

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:13.184
-That's good. This one's tricky.
-Good.

00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:14.719
No way he catches that.

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.287
-Mo.
-Mo.

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:18.022
-They throw Mo a lot.
-I know.

00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:19.157
What the heck?

00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:21.159
[producer] Geol.

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:22.994
The new one.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.562
-Jung Kook.
-So many to catch.

00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:26.364
That one's in a trap.

00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:28.533
YUT

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:29.767
DO

00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:30.868
-Do.
-Catch with Do.

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:31.936
Catch it with Do.

00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:33.070
-One more.
-Yeah.

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:34.639
-One more.
-Yut works too.

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:36.307
-[Jimin] Catch with Yut?
-Do, Gae...

00:44:36.374 --> 00:44:37.375
Yeah, catch it.

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.476
-And...
-And...

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:41.846
-If we get a bad cast, go with a new one.
-Okay.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.048
-Gae?
-Gae.

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.383
Maybe this one... Huh?

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:46.884
-Piggyback?
-Yeah.

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.952
Trust me.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:49.053
Yeah? Okay.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.689
I'm Yut God The Best of Me.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.694
GAME HEATS UP WITH YUT GOD

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.030
ONLY 1 SPACE BETWEEN US

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:01.832
YUT GOD IN DANGER

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.701
-Mo.
-Mo.

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:06.671
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut-Mo lands there.

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:07.772
Mo can catch it.

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:08.839
2 MO.

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.107
Should we catch it?

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.909
Hold on. Two Mo.

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:13.844
2 MO, GEOL

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.112
[Jung Kook] Mo, Mo, Geol?

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:16.447
CAUGHT WITH 2 MO

00:45:16.514 --> 00:45:18.549
-Two Mo.
-Two Mo, then Geol.

00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:20.418
Do-Gae-Geol, then out.

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:21.586
-[Jimin] This one.
-Yeah.

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.487
-Do-Gae-Geol. Good.
-Yes.

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:27.158
PRODUCTION TEAM LANDS ON DO

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:29.260
That doesn't matter for this one.

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:32.196
Back-Do.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.165
Back-Do.

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:39.737
ALL MOVES LEAD TO THE TRAPS

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.772
-[crew laughing]
-This is better?

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.474
This is better.

00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:45.009
-[Jung Kook] Catch it.
-Catch it.

00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:46.978
-[Jimin] One more, one more.
-One more.

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.113
Do-Gae-Geol. Just need a Yut.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.948
You're making it fun.

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:52.283
-Mo.
-Mo.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.517
Told you, no catch.

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.752
[Jung Kook] Mo, Do.

00:45:54.819 --> 00:45:57.622
-Let's move this here.
-Is that better?

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:02.627
NOT GOING WELL FOR PRODUCTION TEAM

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.795
-What now?
-Keep it simple.

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.431
As long as it's not Back-Do.

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:08.766
That'd make things wild.

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.701
Yeah, unless it's Back-Do.

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:12.236
A RAIN CHECK ON DOPAMINE

00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:13.337
-Safe here.
-Yeah.

00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:14.805
-This one?
-Yeah.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.974
-Let's escape.
-Yeah, let's run away.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.744
EACH SIDE TAKES A TURN

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.245
BUT THERE'S NO TWIST

00:46:21.312 --> 00:46:24.415
This might end fast... No, no.

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:25.516
MO

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:26.684
Would've been caught.

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:27.752
You're right.

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:30.721
IF PRODUCTION TEAM ROLLS GAE,
THEY WILL CATCH THEM

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:35.326
BET THEY WON'T

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:37.795
-Geol and?
-You're chasing us?

00:46:37.862 --> 00:46:38.929
[exclaims]

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:40.398
We just need to escape.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.999
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut-Mo.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.402
-[Jung Kook] Oh? It's okay.
-Run.

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:48.172
SO EXCITED

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:49.307
RUNNING FASTER

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:52.176
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut, then Do.

00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:57.415
BOTH TEAMS GOING FORWARD FAST

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.517
They're right behind us.

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.485
Let's go, let's go.

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:04.889
CASTS GAE

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.023
If it's Gae...

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.792
-Let's move this one out.
-Yeah.

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.360
TWO ESCAPE UNDER YUT GOD'S LEAD

00:47:09.427 --> 00:47:12.963
JIMIN &amp; JUNG KOOK 2-0 PRODUCTION TEAM

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.399
Just don't cast Do.

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:17.034
-It's...
-She's got good luck.

00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:18.202
Really good stats.

00:47:18.269 --> 00:47:20.371
Accidentally cast Mo, please.

00:47:20.438 --> 00:47:21.472
Mo.

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:23.908
DO

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.476
Oh, no...

00:47:26.444 --> 00:47:28.412
GOTCHA

00:47:28.479 --> 00:47:31.582
HOPE TURNS INTO DESPAIR

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:33.017
YOU'RE THAT HAPPY?

00:47:33.084 --> 00:47:35.219
They're so happy.

00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:36.287
Hold up.

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:39.590
Good thing
we brought that one home earlier.

00:47:39.657 --> 00:47:41.559
COMFORT THAT DOESN'T REACH

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:42.660
I...

00:47:42.727 --> 00:47:44.362
EXTRA CAST
PRODUCTION GETS GAE

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:45.429
[Jimin] Want a Do?

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:46.831
Yeah, go for Do.

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:47.932
YUT GOD GETS DO

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:50.034
Catch it, one more cast.
No, just leave it?

00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:51.135
Catch it, right?

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.937
-Hold on.
-You must decide.

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.004
You're right.

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:56.440
-You can only go again if you catch.
-Back-Do?

00:47:56.507 --> 00:47:58.943
BACK-DO FLEW BY A SECOND AGO

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.512
It was Back-Do. Catch and Back-Do.

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:04.248
-No, no, no.
-Let go, let go.

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:05.583
WON'T LET GO

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.717
It was Back-Do.

00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:08.753
-It was Back-Do just now...
-That's it.

00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:10.488
Then that's a win.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.822
Wait, if it's Geol...

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:14.558
GEOL = OUT

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:16.694
Do-Gae-Geol? Darn it.

00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:18.662
FINALLY REALIZING IT

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.065
FATE LEAVES THEIR HANDS

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:25.703
PLEASE, ANYTHING BUT GEOL

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.105
NOT GEOL, IT'S MO

00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:30.241
-One more throw.
-One more.

00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:33.110
-If it's Geol, we're done.
-So serious.

00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:34.578
Geol cannot happen.

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.714
BACK-DO

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:39.750
JIMIN &amp; JUNG KOOK 2-2 PRODUCTION TEAM

00:48:39.817 --> 00:48:41.886
-We bring this home, and we win.
-Yeah.

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.821
No way we'll get that.

00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:46.123
-Yut.
-Yut. One more.

00:48:46.891 --> 00:48:47.892
GAE

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:50.694
DEEP IN THOUGHT

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:55.466
Let's move with Yut, and then here.
Use Gae for this, then cast Back-Do.

00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:57.034
Go for Back-Do.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:58.569
You want Back-Do from me?

00:48:58.636 --> 00:48:59.670
-Yes.
-Let's do this.

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:01.806
Out, then Back-Do.

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.007
Then this goes...

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.208
-Yeah.
-This goes out.

00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:05.876
JIMIN &amp; JUNG KOOK 3-2 CREW

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.178
Only one token left.

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.446
Back-Do time.

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.248
NO CHANCE

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:14.051
CAUGHT IMMEDIATELY

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:16.954
LAUGHTER DISAPPEARS

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:19.924
GAE

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.125
Want Geol?

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:24.562
[sighs]

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:25.830
QUIETLY PLACING DO

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.731
Do gets caught easily.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:31.702
TRAP TRIGGERED WITH YUT

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:33.304
Caught.

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:35.906
Ugh!

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.376
But we're the ones who set the trap.

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.779
Exactly. Just regretting it.

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:43.481
MO

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.549
All right. His luck's back.

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.518
We need to keep it in mind now.

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:48.986
We can get lucky too.

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.890
PRODUCTION'S YUT CAST ROUTINE

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:55.493
I guess hitting the ground helps?

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:59.096
PRODUCTION TEAM SPEEDING AT 200KM/H

00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:01.065
Oh, this is bad.

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.901
As long as it's not Back-Do.

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:05.436
Wait, Back-Do...

00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:06.704
Let me see first.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.405
-It's on the left.
-On the left.

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.107
I'll do some calculations.

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:11.709
CALCULATED HAND MOVEMENTS

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.544
SNEAKY MODE FOR BACK-DO

00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:15.613
HOW FAR UP ARE YOU PLACING IT?

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:16.847
What?

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:18.582
I'll still cast them properly.

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:22.620
Back-Do.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.622
IT'S BACK-DO ALRIGHT!

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.757
Back-Do.

00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:28.926
JOY EXPRESSED WITH THE WHOLE BODY

00:50:28.993 --> 00:50:31.462
JOY EXPRESSED WITH THE HANDS

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:33.163
PURE DELIGHT

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:35.399
YOU DID SO GOOD. SO GOOD.

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:36.667
You gotta admit it.

00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:37.768
Did you shout "Go"?

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:39.236
Come on.

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:43.107
A LEGENDARY PLAY

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:44.775
-Legendary.
-Truly legendary.

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:46.544
How are you going to catch ours?

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:48.445
How?

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:49.747
MAXIMUM LEVEL OF SMUG

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:52.416
How are you going to catch ours?

00:50:52.483 --> 00:50:54.585
As long as it's not Mo or Yut.

00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:56.487
[producer] We need Mo and Geol.

00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:58.589
Please no Yut or Mo.

00:50:58.656 --> 00:50:59.657
Mo, Geol.

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:01.759
Mo, Geol.

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:02.826
GEOL

00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:04.862
Geol.

00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:06.630
It's over.

00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:08.198
What do you want now?

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.900
What? Back-Do?

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:11.135
No Back-Do, okay?

00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:15.105
WILL YUT GOD DODGE BACK-DO?

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.640

[exclaims]

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:24.381
-I was awesome. I got a Back-Do.
-[Jimin] But seriously.

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.985
What hurts is, out of all shoots
with the director, this is the worst

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:29.887
expression he's ever made.

00:51:30.888 --> 00:51:33.190
THE COLOR OF PD'S FACE
IS THE SAME AS HIS SHIRT

00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:35.292
I can't believe I got a Back-Do there.

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:39.463
[producer] Anyway, we'll give you
100 francs as we promised.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:40.631
[all cheering]

00:51:40.698 --> 00:51:41.966
Thank you.

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.801
-Great.
-Great.

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:45.169
-[producer] Great job.
-Yeah.

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:48.505
[producer] Now, for your wake-up time.

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:50.741
INSTANTLY FROZEN JOY

00:51:50.808 --> 00:51:52.042
From 7:00 a.m.

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:54.478
-We get more sleep time?
-That depends on your cast.

+120 MIN -30 MIN

00:51:57.281 --> 00:52:00.684
-Let's hope for a Yut.
-We're rooting for you for this.

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:02.653
-Same here.
-Me too.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.088
We need Yut.

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.990
[Jimin] But Yut is hard to get.

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.891
Do you trust my hands?

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.494
I get very unlucky at times like this.

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:11.629
Yut?

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:15.065
Since it's from 7 a.m.,
even a Geol can make it 8:30.

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.334
How should I throw it for good luck?

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.504
Yut is good, right?

00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:21.672
Just not Mo, please.

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.442
EVERYONE'S WAKE-UP TIME
IS IN JUNG KOOK'S HANDS

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.510
Here we go.

GATHERING COSMIC ENERGY

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.787
GAE

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:39.223
-[producer] That means...
-[Jimin] 8:00, then.

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.758
-Who'll do it?
-Huh?

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:41.892
That was practice?

00:52:41.959 --> 00:52:42.993
Yes, who's going?

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.128
-You should go.
-Why?

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.496
Say "Go" and throw.

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.563
-Oh, say "Go"?
-Yeah.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.465
-[producer] You didn't say it.
-Practice.

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:49.833
[producer] This is practice.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.936
-Nagging us to wake up at 8:00.
-Exactly.

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.171
The Yut God says so.

00:52:54.238 --> 00:52:56.240
IF 8:00 IS TOO LATE, WAKE UP AT 7:30

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:57.941
Wait, let me try once.

00:52:58.709 --> 00:53:00.310
DO, GAE

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:01.412
DO

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:02.479
This is it.

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.481
CLUELESS DO

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.150
You need to just go for it.

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:08.485
-No way we'd get Back-Do, right?
-Go?

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.654
-Yes, I should.
-One, two, three.

00:53:10.721 --> 00:53:11.722
-Go.
-Go.

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:12.856
Here we go.

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.692
[♪ intense music playing]

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:16.627
THEY WANT ONE THING

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.463
YUT GOD

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.799
PLEASE

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.735
SEND US A "YUT"

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:28.539
IT'S GAE ANYWAY

[groans]

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.242
-It was meant to be 8:00.
-8:00 it is.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:35.245
We kept casting Gae.
I got chills seeing this Back-Do stick.

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:38.082
I was seriously shocked.

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.850
-So, 8:00?
-8:00.

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:43.153
-It's not bad, eight o'clock.
-Yeah, early's good for you.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.755
At least we earned 100 francs.

00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:45.823
-Yeah.
-Yup.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:46.924
That was wild.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.058
[producer] You're good.

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:49.293
Kind of impressive.

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.562
YUT GOD FINALLY SHOWED HIS POWER

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.697
-[producer] Let's keep it here
-Okay.

00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:54.798
and play again later.

00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:56.166
-Absolutely.

-[Jung Kook] 8:00 a.m., right?
-[Jimin] Yeah.

00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:07.511
[Jung Kook] That Back-Do earlier was wild.

00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:09.680
How did that even happen?

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.683
-[Jimin chuckles]
-If not for that, we wouldn't have won.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.952
[Jimin] We both cast it once, right?

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.887
[Jung Kook] Yeah, it was perfect.

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:20.891
Namjoon sent this, by the way.

00:54:20.958 --> 00:54:22.159
-I saw it.
-You did?

00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:25.963
-[Jung Kook] Namjoon's kind of...
-Sentimental.

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.831
[Jung Kook] He's a really warm person.

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:33.003
FYI: THE VIDEO NAMJOON SENT WAS
AN ANIMATION REMINISCING MILITARY LIFE

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.706
-[Jimin] He enlisted alone, you know.
-Right.

00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:37.508
But for me,

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:41.678
when I think of the military days,
I think of you and me together.

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:46.483
But for him,
it's probably his squad mates.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.419
-[Jung Kook] Makes sense.
-Yeah.

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:53.257
-He had fellow soldiers beside him.
-Right.

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:55.392
-But for us, we had each other.
-Yes.

00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:57.461
That must be a big difference.

00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:01.565
I think he really misses his army buddies.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:04.001
[Jung Kook] It suddenly hit me.

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:07.237
I'm so happy
I don't have to return to base.

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:10.007
[Jimin] I actually
thought the same yesterday.

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:13.744
Not having to give back this phone?
It felt incredible last night.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:17.614
So I forced myself to stay awake
just to keep using it.

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:20.818
-[Jung Kook] Our soldier DNA fully active.
-Right.

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:24.154
[Jimin] I even sleep with it
under my pillow.

00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:25.289
[laughing]

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.291
So I won't lose it.

00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:32.696
It feels so good,
it makes me not want to go to sleep.

00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:36.033
[Jung Kook] I just want to record soon.

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.101
[Jimin] Yeah, I want to try recording too.

00:55:38.936 --> 00:55:40.938

You're gonna get in trouble.

00:55:59.056 --> 00:56:02.025
[producer] Now, the one to get
to the couch first

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:05.329
gets a 1-hour sleep extension.

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:07.965
It's first come, first served.

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.667
[Jimin] How about neither of us goes?

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.937
I want to sleep another hour.

00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:15.873

All right. It's the Capital Quiz.

-It's the Capital Quiz.
-Come on.

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:35.826
I don't know any capitals.

00:56:35.893 --> 00:56:38.028
The capital of the US?

00:56:38.095 --> 00:56:39.529
Washington DC.

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.198
Correct. Go back to sleep.

00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.467
What? That's it? Nice.

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:45.669
[producer] Jimin,
let's head to the cafeteria.

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.104
Okay.

AUTOMATICALLY, JIMIN HAS TO HAVE BREAKFAST

00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:51.475
[producer] Want to try too, Jimin?

-Capitals?
-Yes.

00:56:54.044 --> 00:56:56.146

How'd you know?

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:17.467
How could you not know
the capital of Switzerland?

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:46.817
[Jimin] That's the vibe.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:53.790
Bikers coming from the opposite lane
would think Jung Kook looks cool too.

00:59:53.857 --> 00:59:56.927
With such a bike and outfit,

00:59:57.561 --> 00:59:59.029
I bet he looks awesome.

00:59:59.096 --> 01:00:03.200
I'm driving a car and riding a bike for
the first time here since my discharge.

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.969
I feel insanely good.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:07.537
-[Jimin] Insanely?
-Yup.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.910
Whoa, that was cool.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:19.783
Whoa! Whoa!

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:24.788
BIKER WAVE RELAY BEGINS

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.656
Whoa!

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.425
FEELING AMAZING

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:29.960
[laughs heartily]

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.928
Is that the joy of it?

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.899
I feel so happy.
And I love there are more riders here.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.368
I want to ride with a group too.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.469
Not alone, huh?

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:41.638
[Jung Kook over speaker]
Jimin, get a license.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.140
No, I'm good.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.243
I don't really want to.
I prefer driving cars.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.311
I'm telling you, it's fun.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:49.913
Nope.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:54.050
But the waving part was pretty cool.

[in Korean] Wow.

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:04.427
This is crazy.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.962
It feels like a fairytale.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.466
Meadows and buildings together.

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:11.101
Wow.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.803
I can't stop looking.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:16.873
Jung Kook.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:21.678
I know I should focus on driving,
but this view's unreal.

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:26.283
[Jung Kook] This is so beautiful.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.152
Whoa, what is that?

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:33.390

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:38.895
What is that?

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.364
Wow.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:43.700
Snowy mountains over there.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:48.772
MAJESTIC, GLACIER-CAPPED PEAKS

What's with that water color?

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:54.945
It kind of looks gray.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.313
-[Jimin] Like blue...
-Right?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:00.450
[Jimin] It looks like blue
mixed with a bit of gray. It's so...

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:02.018
Did they add something to it?

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.087
[Jimin laughs] Why is it so pretty?

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.325
Oh...

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.595
This makes driving feel worth it.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:12.996
It's not boring at all.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:16.633
ZERO BOREDOM ALLOWED HERE

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.603

DIFFERENT SCENERY ON EVERY SIDE

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:33.850
It's not dramatic or crazy,

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.685
but it keeps impressing you.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.521
That's the charm here.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.624
A whole new kind of joy.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:45.195
You know, earning and saving up money

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.964
and going on a trip,

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:50.867
I think it's a big part of life.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:55.472
Of course, we're not living our life
only for this,

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:58.441
but trips like this make me think
for a moment,

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.244
"Oh, this is why I live."

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.546
Yeah.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:07.150
It'd be nice
if he and I can share this feeling.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:10.887
If not,
I just hope he gets to feel this too.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.089
That's how I feel.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:22.799

about the taste first though.

how they'd taste first. I'm terrible.

TAKING IT WITH THEIR EYES NOW

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.358
But this is...

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.896
Seeing the snow together
makes it feel surreal.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:07.503
Wow, this is amazing.
I got to capture this in my memory.

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:12.308
It's so overwhelming,
it's like it has no depth, as you said.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.477
You normally don't see all this at once.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.545
[Jung Kook] Yeah.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.214
[Jimin] Normally, some parts are covered.

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:19.382
-[Jimin] Yeah.
-This way.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.017
[Jung Kook] To know how far it is.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:24.020
[Jimin] Seeing all the snowy peaks
at once feels off.

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:27.857
UNBELIEVABLY VAST AND SURREAL

[Jimin] Time to go.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.871
It's kind of sad to leave.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN TOWARD THE NEXT STOP

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.913
I can feel the altitude dropping.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.249
We're basically at the bottom now.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:29.185

Even after driving so long, I'm not tired.

[producer] Jimin, what do you
want to do most right now?

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.820
Perform as BTS, of course.

I really miss BTS promos.

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:12.195
I mean, I've got
enough firewood stacked inside.

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:18.334
But the problem is,
the fireplace's kind of gotten a bit old.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.171
Still, I've saved
more than enough firewood.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.515
Oh, nice and cool.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:20.990
Which floor?

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.391
[Jung Kook] Third floor.

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.860
Room 302.

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.595
Let's go up.

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:27.896
[keypad beeping]

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.066
My gosh, that scared me.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.003
STILL FEELING SPECIAL

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.571
Is this really our place?

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.307
[exclaims]

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:39.541
JUST ONE DOOR HERE?

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.809
[Jung Kook] What the heck?

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.311
[doorbell rings]

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:43.779
This is amazing.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:45.614
There's even a terrace.

01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:48.484
Seriously, this is so nice.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.153
SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.389
COMFORTABLE KITCHEN

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.724
CLEAN BEDROOM

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.893
AND A STUNNING VIEW TOO

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.928
But we don't know which is our room yet.

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.063
-[Jimin] Right?
-But...

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.632
Maybe the one with
our suitcases is our room?

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:05.868
Shouldn't there be a camera?

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:09.505
PROS LOOK FOR THE CAMERA FIRST

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:10.572
Found it?

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.075
Yeah, here it is. There are pajamas too.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.443
But there's only one.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.945
This has to be our room.
The camera's here.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.516
-Isn't it the one?
-[crew member] We got you two rooms.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.817
Oh, really?

01:20:21.884 --> 01:20:24.119
[Jimin] This one's a room too? Oh, it is.

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:25.754
Pick whichever one you want.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.289
[Jimin] I'll take this one then.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:28.824
-That one?
-Yeah.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.160
Today we have a mountain view.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.297
Love it. So natural.
I mean, nature-friendly.

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:37.366
This is nice.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.168
So nice.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:42.404
JIMIN'S ROOM

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.006
[Jimin] It's so pretty here.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:46.775
It feels way cozier.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.578
The other one was... It was nice.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.114
But this one's even better.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:55.818
The other one was like a roadside hotel.

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:59.088
This is more like a villa
right in the village.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:02.191
You get a full view of the whole town.
It's lovely.

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.059
Truly breathtaking.

01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:07.930
The camera doesn't do it justice.
Well, it's just mine to enjoy...

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.734
DONE TOURING. OFF TO EAT

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.670
[Jung Kook] I really want lamb now.

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:16.972
[in English] Thank you.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.708
ARRIVES AT A PLACE FOR DINNER

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:22.010
-[in Korean] You ate a lot? Oh, the tacos?
-Yes.

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:25.681
It's fine. Once the food comes,
you'll eat just like yesterday.

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:28.217
Whoa, look at that. It's so fancy.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.352
Whoa, what is this place?

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:31.420
OLD-WORLD CHARM

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.155
-Look at those stairs.
-[Jimin] Hey.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.557
-What?
-Just gonna walk down like it's nothing?

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.993
-Just filming.
-It's a nobleman's entrance.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.363
-How does a nobleman enter?
-The camera's rolling. Just walk in.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.432
Oh, you weren't filming there?

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.402
STRIKING A POSE AS HE WALKS IN

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.837
Why go in like that? Just walk normally.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.773
PREFERS THE SIMPLE ROUTE

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:54.510
I made it.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.046
-I was seriously...
-Thank you.

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.115
In a royal robe and all...

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.718
With a fake beard on... Oh, thank you.

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:04.586
GETS THE MENU RIGHT AWAY

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:08.390
[Jimin] What is this again?

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:10.793
Help me, translation apps.

01:22:11.827 --> 01:22:15.998
USING A TRANSLATOR APP

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.168
I need to lose weight.

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.302
NOT GOING WELL

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:25.307
I'm too shy to talk to them.

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:27.443
I can. What do you want to ask?

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:30.979
Ask for their most popular dish.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:32.714
[in English] Excuse me.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.483
Please.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:36.752
-[in English] Could you...
-Popular menu...

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:38.587
RECOMMEND ME...

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:39.855
This is all grilled.

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:41.657
-All grilled?
-Yeah.

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:44.426
-This is Chateaubriand.
-Chateaubriand?

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.497
-Tomahawk is for two people.
-[both exclaim]

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.098
[in Korean] Want to get Tomahawk?

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:52.100
-For the two of us?
-[in Korean] Yeah.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.268
Tomahawk?

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.570
[in Korean] Let's share it.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.038
Honestly, I can't eat much.

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:57.105
[in English] Lamb.

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.307
1 TOMAHAWK, 1 LAMB

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.708
-And one lamb?
-Yeah.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:05.113
FEELING CONFIDENT, ORDERING MORE

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.015
-[in English] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.083
ORDER COMPLETE

01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:10.953
Let's go.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.021
WINE SERVED RIGHT AWAY

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.089
Yeah, I want it.

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.225
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:18.026
Seriously.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:22.998
[in Korean] It's good.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:24.466
[in English] Amazing.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:27.369
-Please, more. Give me.
-More?

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:28.971
Oh, thank you.

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.405
FULL GLASS

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.108
-Thank you so much.
-You're impressed, no?

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:36.211
[in Korean] And there you go,
charming someone again.

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:39.381
[producer] They say "Santé"
for cheers here.

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:41.316
"SANTÉ" MEANS "HEALTH" IN FRENCH

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.151
USED IN CASUAL CONVOS OR AT MEALS

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.920
MAKE EYE CONTACT WHEN YOU CLINK

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:46.555
-Just...
-[producer] Eye contact is

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:50.292
to see if the other person's
deceiving you.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.060
Oh, I'll close my eyes.

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.630
I totally trust you.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.331
"Santé" with my eyes closed.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:00.135
[in Korean] But we can't see our glasses.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:01.203
Okay, cheers.

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:03.405
That worked.

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:06.208
FINALLY NAILED THE SANTÉ!

01:24:08.944 --> 01:24:11.213
That was pure trust in a "Santé."

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.849
[producer] I'm 27 now.

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.083
Santé.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:17.419
Santé, director.

01:24:17.486 --> 01:24:18.754
Eyes closed.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:30.532
MAIN DISHES ARE HERE

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:32.501
-It's okay?
-[Jimin in English] Yeah.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.042
[Jung Kook exclaims]

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:43.779
TOMAHAWK &amp; LAMB

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:46.248
[in Korean] I'll start
slicing the Tomahawk.

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.549
This isn't the Tomahawk?

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:48.617
That's the lamb.

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:50.485
The sauce...

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:53.488
FOODIE ALWAYS HAS A PLAN

01:24:56.992 --> 01:24:58.360
Mmm!

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.028
Let me try lamb.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.598
TAKES A BIG BITE

01:25:04.967 --> 01:25:06.068
SO GOOD

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:07.636
How should I show this?

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:09.204
Jung Kook taught me.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:12.107
TRYING JUNG KOOK'S RECIPE

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:24.219
THE BURRITO'S LONG FORGOTTEN

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.921
Jung Kook, can I eat this?

01:25:25.988 --> 01:25:27.823
-Yes.
-Thanks.

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:30.258
EVERY BITE FEELS LIKE THE FIRST

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.094
You...

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.163
You look full but still eat so well.

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.635
I don't know why it keeps going in.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.770
You ate about the same as I did.

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:43.639
Can I have one bite?

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:44.706
MIGHT AS WELL...

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:46.742
Looks so good, right?

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:48.343
I'll give you.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:51.113
Doesn't it look good?
I'll give you a little.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.549
It's greasy, but since they put wine
in it, so it's delicious.

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:01.590
This is so good.

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:04.092
Jimin really enjoyed that.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.161
I'm going to burst.

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:07.596
DAY 1 IN ZERMATT: COMPLETE

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.098
-Ready to fly?
-[in English] Yeah, I am ready.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.967
SO NOT READY

01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:16.371
SHOWING HOW EXCITED HE IS
WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:18.306
FEARLESS YOUNGEST

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.642
Scaredy-cat(?) JIMIN

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:22.310
I'm a bit nervous.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:27.849
JIMIN'S SKY-HIGH SURVIVAL STORY
IS REVEALED NEXT WEEK!

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.252
ARE YOU SURE?!

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.320
