02:36.811 --> 02:38.744
-[Agent] Kathelia doesn't
speak.

02:40.988 --> 02:43.266
Um, she understands speech,

02:43.301 --> 02:44.716
and she's clever.

02:44.785 --> 02:46.027
She finds ways
to communicate,

02:46.096 --> 02:48.996
so it's not as challenging
as it sounds.

02:48.996 --> 02:51.412
-[Man] Canshe speak?

02:52.862 --> 02:54.864
-[Agent] We don't know yet.

02:54.933 --> 02:56.176
It could be a birth defect

02:56.176 --> 02:58.385
or some sort of
coping mechanism.

02:58.454 --> 03:01.905
And it's also possible
she just doesn't want to talk.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.183
-This says that
she's been returned

03:03.183 --> 03:04.874
to you guys before.

03:04.874 --> 03:07.670
-[Agent] Yes, we placed her
with an older couple.

03:07.704 --> 03:09.189
Retired.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.881
Adult children,
no grandchildren.

03:13.089 --> 03:14.711
I just think they bit off
a little more

03:14.780 --> 03:16.299
than they could chew.

03:16.472 --> 03:18.232
[dog barking]

03:18.543 --> 03:21.304
And it looks like
there were some health problems.

03:21.339 --> 03:22.719
-With Kathelia?

03:22.754 --> 03:24.307
-[Agent] No, Kathelia's fine
physically.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.378
-[Woman] Okay.

03:26.413 --> 03:28.380
-She just needs a family.

03:30.831 --> 03:33.696
-[Woman] We really just
wanna do the most good.

03:56.719 --> 03:59.584
-[Robin] Daniel is on summer
break,

03:59.584 --> 04:01.758
and I work from home
most of the time,

04:01.793 --> 04:03.588
so we'll all be together.

04:04.451 --> 04:06.694
That is where you'll go
to school in the fall.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.731
-I might even be
your teacher!

04:08.765 --> 04:09.766
If you're lucky!

04:09.835 --> 04:11.112
-[Robin] [chuckles]

04:12.113 --> 04:13.287
That's me.

04:13.322 --> 04:16.221
-[Daniel] That's Robin,
building another dream home.

04:18.706 --> 04:22.676
[wind chimes jangling]
[water rippling]

04:25.920 --> 04:27.543

04:28.613 --> 04:30.856
[rapid heartbeat pulsing]

04:34.619 --> 04:36.897
Well, how about
we go upstairs?

04:36.931 --> 04:39.279
Then we can show you
your room.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.625
Yeah?

04:40.625 --> 04:42.109
Watch your step
right there.

04:42.143 --> 04:45.802
Okay. So our room is
just down the hall,

04:45.837 --> 04:48.149
and your room
is right over here.

04:54.121 --> 04:56.917
[gentle music]

04:58.781 --> 05:00.161
-So...

05:01.680 --> 05:03.475
what do you think?

05:03.510 --> 05:05.443
It's all yours.

05:08.135 --> 05:11.000
-[Robin] We put some new clothes
in the closet for you.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.760
Hope you like them.
[nervous chuckle]

05:18.870 --> 05:21.113
Oh, that was my doll
when I was your age.

05:21.804 --> 05:23.668
-[Doll] Mommy, I love you.
-Now she has someone new

05:23.668 --> 05:24.945
to play with.

05:30.951 --> 05:33.781
We should probably
get some darker dolls too.

05:34.748 --> 05:36.197
-Mm-hmm.

05:43.860 --> 05:45.414
-Would you like
some lunch?

05:46.794 --> 05:48.106
Do you like crusts

05:48.140 --> 05:50.142
or no crusts
on your sandwiches?

05:51.558 --> 05:53.870
I think you're
a no-crust girl.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.838
Me too.
[phone ringing]

05:57.218 --> 05:58.737
Hi, Mom.

05:58.806 --> 06:00.118
-[Mom] [over phone]
I couldn't wait any longer.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.671
How is she?

06:02.223 --> 06:04.916
-[Robin] [into phone]
Um... she's lovely.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.400
-[Mom] [over phone]
Oh, thank goodness.

06:06.435 --> 06:09.196
Honey, I have to tell you
this because I love you.

06:09.230 --> 06:11.647
I went on the internet
and I found out what happened

06:11.681 --> 06:12.717
to your new little girl.

06:12.786 --> 06:13.752
It's horrible.

06:13.821 --> 06:16.583
-What?
Mom... no!

06:16.617 --> 06:19.206
-[Mom] [over phone] The mother
butchered the whole family!

06:19.240 --> 06:21.139
Her husband,
her other two kids--

06:21.173 --> 06:22.520
-Oh my god--

06:22.554 --> 06:23.935
-[Mom] [over phone] Police
took the bodies away

06:24.004 --> 06:25.730
in little bags.
-Mom, stop!

06:25.730 --> 06:26.869
-[Mom] [over phone]
You need to hear this--

06:26.903 --> 06:28.871
-We already know!

06:28.905 --> 06:31.045
-[Mom] [over phone]
Oh, I see.

06:31.045 --> 06:32.392
You hadn't mentioned it.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.738
-No?

06:33.772 --> 06:35.015
-[Mom] [over phone] She
doesn't seem off, does she?

06:35.049 --> 06:36.913
I mean,
sometimes that's hereditary.

06:36.913 --> 06:39.571
-She's a
little girl, Mom.

06:39.606 --> 06:40.745
She's fine.

06:40.745 --> 06:42.747
She's just been through
some shit.

06:42.781 --> 06:44.749
-[Mom] [over phone] Well,
I hope she appreciates you

06:44.783 --> 06:45.750
taking her in.

06:45.784 --> 06:47.890
-Oh, god! Daniel!

06:47.924 --> 06:50.444
[foreboding music]

06:50.479 --> 06:53.965
-[Daniel] So that's your window
right over there.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.692
Then the birdhouse
to the left of it,

06:56.726 --> 06:58.279
I built that.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.937
Robin, she thinks
it's too small

07:01.006 --> 07:02.594
but, I don't know,

07:02.594 --> 07:03.975
I kinda like it.

07:04.044 --> 07:06.080
Birds like it,
that's for sure.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.944
Have a little nest by now.

07:08.013 --> 07:09.808
Little--little eggs.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.638
Little birdie babies.

07:11.707 --> 07:13.433
[birds chirping]

07:13.467 --> 07:15.642
-[Robin] Hey, don't eat
the fruit.

07:15.711 --> 07:16.815
It's moldy.

07:16.884 --> 07:18.472
-What?
-It's rotten.

07:18.541 --> 07:19.611
It's fine.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.924
I brought sandwiches.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.650
[sighs]

07:23.719 --> 07:25.272
-Rob...

07:27.550 --> 07:30.450
[haunting music]

07:32.003 --> 07:34.454
-[Daniel] Yeah, I'm not seeing
anything wrong.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.489
The fridge is fine.

07:35.558 --> 07:37.836
-Everything in the fridge
is spoiled, Daniel.

07:37.905 --> 07:39.769
It's obviously not fine.

07:39.804 --> 07:40.839
-I mean...

07:40.908 --> 07:41.944
-Oh, yep.
Mm-hmm.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.117
This is spoiled too.

07:43.117 --> 07:45.119
-Mustard is eternal.

07:45.879 --> 07:46.983
-Smell it.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.088
-Ugh!
Jesus Christ!

07:48.122 --> 07:49.330
-Yeah, I told you.
I know.

07:49.399 --> 07:50.400
-Ugh!

07:50.435 --> 07:53.024
-Okay, I have to get
Kathelia ready for bed.

07:53.093 --> 07:54.577
I don't know.
-Well, I'll fix it.

07:54.612 --> 07:56.821
-Mm-hmm.
-I can fix it!

07:56.855 --> 07:59.237
[water running]

08:06.002 --> 08:08.142
-Kathelia!

08:26.333 --> 08:27.334
[gasps]

08:27.368 --> 08:30.337
[nervous chuckle]
You got me!

08:32.028 --> 08:33.098
You're like a...

08:33.133 --> 08:35.445
little gremlin!

08:35.480 --> 08:37.378
That's a really
pretty swimsuit.

08:37.413 --> 08:40.174
Are you gonna wear
that to take a bath?

08:40.209 --> 08:42.522
You know,
we don't have to

08:42.556 --> 08:44.385
keep any secrets.

08:46.698 --> 08:48.389
It's okay,
I get it.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.046
Hop in.

08:52.014 --> 08:53.705
“Kathelia.”

08:54.879 --> 08:57.019
You have such
an interesting name.

08:59.366 --> 09:01.230
Do you know what name
I always liked?

09:01.264 --> 09:03.473
I like the name “Jessica.”

09:04.716 --> 09:06.511
I think it's really pretty.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.134
Do you like it?

09:09.894 --> 09:11.412
Jessica?

09:16.245 --> 09:18.834
Okay, do you wanna know
a secret?

09:19.697 --> 09:21.215
About me?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.082
You're not my first
little girl.

09:29.707 --> 09:32.710
I had four before you.

09:36.023 --> 09:38.094
I didn't get
to meet them though.

09:43.272 --> 09:45.550
[reluctant chuckle]

09:45.585 --> 09:48.277
But that's okay
because I'm getting to know you.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.591
[foreboding music]

09:55.422 --> 09:58.425
-[whistling] Baah!

09:59.288 --> 10:02.118
Snug as a bug in a rug.
[sighs]

10:02.153 --> 10:03.361
-I brought you
some water

10:03.395 --> 10:04.949
in case you get thirsty.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.400
Oh, wait.

10:11.231 --> 10:13.785
How about a bedtime friend?

10:17.030 --> 10:18.410
It's for you.

10:25.832 --> 10:28.628
-If you need anything at all,

10:28.628 --> 10:31.941
we're just...
right down the hall, okay?

10:33.149 --> 10:34.875
Happy first night home.

10:36.152 --> 10:37.947
-Good night, Kathelia.

10:38.845 --> 10:40.329
Kathy.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.296
-[Daniel] Kathy?

10:42.296 --> 10:44.091
-[giggles] I know.

10:44.126 --> 10:45.161
-Kathy?

10:45.196 --> 10:46.128
-I know!
I was just...

10:46.128 --> 10:47.163
-[groaning]

10:47.198 --> 10:48.889
-Just trying something out.

10:49.787 --> 10:50.995
It was bad.

10:51.029 --> 10:52.928
-Yeah, well,
she's not much of a Kathy.

10:52.962 --> 10:54.826
-No, she is not.

10:54.861 --> 10:57.760
She looks at me like
she's mentally cutting me open.

11:00.832 --> 11:02.523
I feel like
I'm doing it all wrong.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.456
-No...
No, no, no, no.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.012
[sighs]

11:08.046 --> 11:10.359
I don't think
we have to try so hard.

11:11.429 --> 11:12.361
Okay?

11:12.430 --> 11:15.019
Just...
let her breathe.

11:16.330 --> 11:18.678
Hmm?
Everything is new.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.336
Strange.

11:25.132 --> 11:26.996
She doesn't know us.

11:27.894 --> 11:29.205
We don't know her.

11:33.037 --> 11:35.867
-[Robin] I keep thinking about
her mom.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.042
How do you trust someone
after something like that?

11:38.076 --> 11:39.802
How do you trust anyone?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.496
I don't want her
to feel that way with us.

11:45.635 --> 11:46.636
-Hmm.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.397
-I just...

11:48.397 --> 11:50.813
I just really want her
to feel safe with me.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.716
-Kathy's not gonna
win her over.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.889
-No. [chuckles]

-Hi.

13:33.157 --> 13:34.883
-Look what I found
in the pool.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.333
-Eww.
What is that?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.472
-It's cool!
I don't know.

13:38.507 --> 13:39.991
I think it's cool.

13:40.026 --> 13:41.165
Hey, Kathelia, you want to see
something cool?

13:41.165 --> 13:42.511
-Uh, I think
she's sleeping.

13:42.511 --> 13:45.963
Hey, what did you do
with all my knives?

13:45.997 --> 13:47.827
-Uh... nothing.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.450
-Really?
So if I go in your man-cave,

13:50.484 --> 13:51.831
I'm not gonna find
all my knives?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.834
-No, no, no.
You don't go in my space.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.663
That is my space.
You don't go in there.

13:56.697 --> 13:59.700
-Mm-hmm.
-It's off limits to, uh...

13:59.769 --> 14:00.770

14:04.050 --> 14:05.292

-Have a good day
at work.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.263
-Thank you.
Bye.

14:10.297 --> 14:11.505
-Bye.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.956
-I'll be at
the model home.

14:13.991 --> 14:16.165

15:00.761 --> 15:02.349
There you are.

15:02.384 --> 15:04.386
How was your, uh...

15:04.420 --> 15:06.077
how was your first
night home?

15:06.077 --> 15:07.527
You--you sleep okay?

15:08.735 --> 15:13.429
Oh, these are my dad's
old tools.

15:14.258 --> 15:16.260
He wanted me
to be a doctor.

15:16.294 --> 15:18.400
[scoffing]
Can you imagine?

15:19.608 --> 15:25.441
Oh! That is...
not for you.

15:25.476 --> 15:27.927
I should probably
find another spot for that.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.687
That goes there.

15:31.896 --> 15:32.932
[drill whirring]

15:32.966 --> 15:34.761
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:34.795 --> 15:37.591
[nervous chuckle]
[exasperated sigh]

15:37.626 --> 15:39.593
I gotta kid-proof better.

15:40.456 --> 15:42.562
You're trouble,
aren't you?

15:44.426 --> 15:45.427
What?

15:45.461 --> 15:46.635
Oh, this?

15:46.635 --> 15:51.951
Yeah, I found this
in the pool this morning.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.642
Kinda neat, huh?

15:53.676 --> 15:56.438
I mean, gross that was
in the pool, but...

15:56.472 --> 15:57.784
Wait a second...

15:57.818 --> 15:59.959
[playful music]

15:59.959 --> 16:02.064
[whispering]
I think it's moving.

16:03.169 --> 16:04.480
Check this out.

16:07.518 --> 16:09.451
Aaaah!
[container clatters]

16:09.485 --> 16:12.074
Um, sorry.
I'm sorry.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.352
Hey, Kathelia,

16:14.421 --> 16:16.285
I--I--I, uh,
that was a joke.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.838
I was joking!

16:19.979 --> 16:23.672
[soft, dreamy tune]

16:29.954 --> 16:33.923
[water flowing]

16:42.829 --> 16:45.004
[water falling]

16:53.495 --> 16:55.669
-[Girl] They don't go away
forever.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.603
They come out
down there.

17:01.779 --> 17:03.505
I'm Fiona.

17:03.539 --> 17:06.025
I live over there.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.337
[birds chirping]

17:10.063 --> 17:11.858
Can I try?

17:13.204 --> 17:14.826
Trade for a candy?

17:15.793 --> 17:18.002
[water rushing]

17:18.485 --> 17:21.661
[gentle music]

17:25.182 --> 17:26.562
Another?

17:26.631 --> 17:29.807
[gentle music continues]

17:34.570 --> 17:36.986
[clattering]

17:39.368 --> 17:41.888
[foreboding music]

17:41.888 --> 17:43.407
-Huh.

17:43.407 --> 17:46.065
-[Fiona] You have so many dolls!

17:47.273 --> 17:48.895
I used to have dolls.

17:50.621 --> 17:52.933
My mama doesn't
let me anymore.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.524
Which should we pick?

18:01.942 --> 18:04.600
Okay, let's play
with that one.

18:07.396 --> 18:08.915
She's pretty.

18:12.539 --> 18:14.196
Here.

18:14.438 --> 18:15.853
You can tie her up.

18:18.476 --> 18:22.066
[menacing music]

18:27.692 --> 18:29.453
The insides are best.

18:29.453 --> 18:32.387
That's where
the colors are.

18:32.421 --> 18:36.115
See?
This one's pink.

18:41.223 --> 18:43.225
I like talking to you.

18:44.985 --> 18:48.506
-[Daniel] Hey!
Are you Fiona?

18:48.575 --> 18:51.233
-Uh-huh.
We're playing dolls!

18:52.165 --> 18:53.960
-Starlight!

18:53.994 --> 18:56.825
You're giving me
a heart attack!

18:56.859 --> 18:58.896
I've been looking
all over for you.

18:58.930 --> 18:59.931
Hi.

18:59.966 --> 19:01.864
-The girls were out
at the creek.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.280
-They didn't give you
any trouble, right?

19:03.314 --> 19:04.660
She was good?
-Yeah.

19:04.695 --> 19:05.972
-We were playing with dolls.

19:06.006 --> 19:08.423
-Dolls!
Cool, I bet you liked that!

19:08.457 --> 19:09.493
-Mm-hmm.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.840
-Fuck me! [laughing]

19:11.909 --> 19:13.428
-Oh, I'm Daniel.

19:13.462 --> 19:15.775
-Lizzie Carmichael.

19:15.809 --> 19:17.604
Thank you, guys.
You're my hero.

19:17.639 --> 19:18.674
-[Robin] [chuckles]

19:18.674 --> 19:20.814
-So, uh,
where's your new friend?

19:20.814 --> 19:23.852
-Oh! Uh, oh, there she is.

19:23.886 --> 19:25.681
That's our daughter,
Kathelia.

19:25.681 --> 19:28.512
-[Lizzie] Hi!
Hi, Kathelia.

19:28.512 --> 19:29.651
Aw, she's beautiful.

19:29.685 --> 19:30.686
-[Robin] Thank you.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.826
-[Lizzie] She's fine.
Just fine.

19:35.691 --> 19:38.142
-That lady is a door.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.733
-The shit kids say!
[laughing]

19:42.802 --> 19:46.185
-Well, our girls
are two peas in a pod.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.359
-That would be...

19:48.394 --> 19:50.499
that would be something.

19:50.534 --> 19:51.845
Yeah.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.640
All right, thanks so much.

19:53.675 --> 19:55.055
-[Robin] Nice to meet you.

19:55.055 --> 19:56.505
-I'm gonna go and pick up
my shitty mom of the year award.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.024
-[Robin] No.

19:59.715 --> 20:01.234
-[Daniel]
I think it looks better.

20:01.303 --> 20:02.408
-[Robin] You're messing with me.

20:02.477 --> 20:04.203
-It's like a little zombie.

20:04.962 --> 20:06.722
-God, they were so odd!

20:06.757 --> 20:08.724
And I don't know how
you didn't pick up on that.

20:08.724 --> 20:11.210
-I thought they were nice.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.522
-My alarms were going off
the entire time.

20:13.557 --> 20:15.144
-Huh.

20:15.179 --> 20:17.388
-Her mom--
Mm...

20:17.423 --> 20:18.562
-Lizzie?

20:18.562 --> 20:21.254
-Yeah. I dunno,
it's like she's got

20:21.323 --> 20:23.705
some dark secrets or something.
[nervous chuckle]

20:23.739 --> 20:26.397
-She's a single mom
with a special needs kid.

20:26.397 --> 20:27.881
That's gotta be tough, right?

20:27.916 --> 20:29.228
-Oh, hey, I get that.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.575
But I mean, that's like
serial killer behavior.

20:31.609 --> 20:33.232
-[Daniel] No, kids do
stuff like that all the time.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.750
-I didn't!

20:34.750 --> 20:36.407
-Look, Fiona...
she likes Kathelia.

20:36.407 --> 20:37.857
I don't see that's such
a bad thing right now.

20:37.891 --> 20:39.686
-No, I want her
to have friends.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.412
I just...

20:41.447 --> 20:43.069
You know what we could do?

20:43.103 --> 20:44.415
We could have all
of our friends

20:44.450 --> 20:45.589
who have kids over.

20:45.623 --> 20:46.762
For like a cookout.

20:46.762 --> 20:47.936
-If that's, yeah,
if that's what you want.

20:48.005 --> 20:49.109
-Yeah.
I just think that

20:49.109 --> 20:50.973
Kathelia needs
a little normalcy right now.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.699
I mean, she's just been
surrounded by darkness.

20:52.734 --> 20:55.426
I don't think
that she needs any more...

20:55.461 --> 20:57.739
You found my knives!

20:57.773 --> 20:59.430
Where were they?

20:59.430 --> 21:01.639
-They... were...

21:01.708 --> 21:03.952
in... Kathelia's room.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.367
-What?

21:05.402 --> 21:06.437
-[Daniel] Yeah.

21:06.472 --> 21:07.990
Hey, kiddo!
How you doing?

21:08.059 --> 21:09.820
-[softly] Hi.
-We were just talking about you.

21:09.889 --> 21:11.408
We're thinking of having
a little cookout.

21:11.442 --> 21:12.788
Invite all the kids
around the neighborhood.

21:12.857 --> 21:13.962
That sound fun?

21:16.102 --> 21:17.103
-Yeah.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.523
-Hey.

23:06.557 --> 23:07.489
-Hi.

23:12.011 --> 23:13.806
-What are we
doing out here?

23:14.600 --> 23:16.981
-[sighs]
You're gonna laugh at me.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.989
Something's...
not right.

23:25.818 --> 23:27.336
In the house.

23:27.923 --> 23:30.547
[eerie ambient music]

23:31.202 --> 23:32.687
It's like when I'm alone,

23:32.721 --> 23:34.516
I don't feel like I'm alone.

23:35.103 --> 23:37.001
My stomach gets tight.

23:38.071 --> 23:39.970
And I have a hard time
catching my breath.

23:40.039 --> 23:42.766
And it feels like
there's something...

23:44.250 --> 23:46.597
else in there with me.

23:46.632 --> 23:49.945
[foreboding music]

23:49.980 --> 23:52.292
I've felt that way
ever since we got Kathelia.

23:53.949 --> 23:55.848
-Oh, boy...

23:56.952 --> 23:59.921
You, uh, [scoffing]

23:59.955 --> 24:00.922
you really spooked yourself
this time.

24:00.922 --> 24:01.992
-Oh, come on!

24:02.061 --> 24:03.269
This is why
I don't tell you things!

24:03.269 --> 24:05.927
-No, hey--no,
I'm--I'm with you.

24:05.927 --> 24:07.791
I am.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.378
I've been
feeling strange too.

24:09.413 --> 24:10.897
-Yeah?

24:10.932 --> 24:12.899
-I'm sure
Kathelia is as well.

24:14.107 --> 24:16.213
-I don't know what
she's feeling.

24:17.939 --> 24:21.045
[foreboding music]

24:21.080 --> 24:22.909
-[whispering] Come inside.

24:24.773 --> 24:26.292
-In a minute.

24:26.810 --> 24:28.259
-[softly] Okay.

24:29.675 --> 24:31.228
-Mm.

24:34.334 --> 24:38.442
-Hey! I think
we could use a party.

It's gonna eat your face.

you got your
gold star taking her in.

26:02.940 --> 26:03.941
-[chuckles] Yeah.

26:04.010 --> 26:05.046
-[Woman] How's she adapting?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.772
-Good. Yeah.

26:06.841 --> 26:08.394
-We heard about her family--

26:08.428 --> 26:12.087
-Uh, Kathelia!
You look beautiful!

26:13.572 --> 26:15.194
Um, this is Maddox's mom

26:15.228 --> 26:16.747
and--and Chelsea's mom.

26:16.747 --> 26:17.748
-Hello, Kathelia.

26:17.748 --> 26:19.578
It's so nice to meet you.

So darling in that dress!

-[Beth] Look at this party!
All of these people!

26:28.241 --> 26:30.761
Are you having
a nice time?

26:30.761 --> 26:32.591
Have you met my daughter
Maddox yet?

26:32.591 --> 26:33.799
You'll love her.

26:33.868 --> 26:36.767

It's dead birds!

something in your teeth.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.430
-[Beth] Oh.

26:47.467 --> 26:50.091
-[Maddox] Hey. I heard
your mom killed your dad.

26:50.125 --> 26:51.299
Do you remember it?

26:51.299 --> 26:53.542
Were you there
when she did it?

26:54.474 --> 26:55.441
-[Man] Ohh!

26:55.475 --> 26:56.442
-[Beth] Maddox!

26:56.442 --> 26:57.616
-Get off!

-[Beth] What are you doing?

27:03.311 --> 27:06.141
-[Robin] Kathelia!
Get off of her!

27:06.141 --> 27:07.971
Kathelia!
That is not okay!

27:07.971 --> 27:10.180
We do not behave
this way!

What's happening?

Are you, are you drunk?

28:35.230 --> 28:37.646
Maybe don't go in there.
[nervous chuckle]

[shouting] Kathelia!

30:57.200 --> 30:58.235
-Go check the creek.

30:58.304 --> 30:59.616

Are you okay?

Hey, wake up!

-I want to see Kathelia.

32:22.561 --> 32:24.459
-Fiona would like to
see Kathelia.

32:24.459 --> 32:27.117
She won't
shut up about it.

32:27.117 --> 32:28.463
Look, um, Kathelia...

32:28.463 --> 32:30.638
she's had kind of
a rough night, so...

32:30.638 --> 32:32.295
-Actually, we've all
had a rough night.

32:32.329 --> 32:34.262
It's--
it's not really good time.

32:34.297 --> 32:35.988
-[Lizzie] See, Fiona,
it's not a good time.

32:36.057 --> 32:38.646
Fiona! Oh my god, man.

32:38.646 --> 32:41.373
She's being such
an asshole today!

32:49.243 --> 32:51.210
-You tried to get away.

32:53.074 --> 32:55.318
You're stuck here now.

Good.
Let's play.

[eerie ambient music]

33:20.653 --> 33:23.173
Your colors are funny.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.314
I talk to
a lot of people.

33:26.763 --> 33:29.179
Some have pretty colors.

33:29.214 --> 33:31.354
Most are the same.

33:31.388 --> 33:33.356
No one has your colors.

33:34.633 --> 33:36.221
-[Daniel] Hey.
[knocking]

33:36.290 --> 33:41.019
Just uh, checking in
on you girls.

33:43.193 --> 33:44.712
What are you doing?

33:44.712 --> 33:48.026
-It's Kathelia.
She's not done yet.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.648
She needs another head.

33:49.682 --> 33:51.788
-It'll look just
like her then.

33:53.859 --> 33:55.033
You doing okay?

33:58.070 --> 33:59.968
-Monsters are coming.

34:01.142 --> 34:03.696
-Monsters? Here?

34:03.731 --> 34:05.526
To this... house?

34:05.560 --> 34:07.252
-They'll be here soon.

[nervous chuckle]

34:22.439 --> 34:23.854
let's not scare
each other here.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.925
Um, monsters, are not...

34:25.994 --> 34:27.065
anything to be afraid of.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.929
They're like shadows.

34:29.964 --> 34:33.243
They might seem scary,
but they cannot hurt us.

34:33.243 --> 34:36.660
-[Fiona] [chucking]

34:38.214 --> 34:40.423
-Why, why is that funny?

34:40.423 --> 34:42.390
-You're funny.

34:42.425 --> 34:44.254
You're wrong.

34:45.186 --> 34:49.017
-Okay. [chuckles]
That's... nice.

34:49.639 --> 34:53.919
Okay, I'm gonna leave
you two to...

34:53.919 --> 34:56.266
continue playing.

34:56.301 --> 34:57.750

35:30.473 --> 35:32.095
A real one.

35:33.510 --> 35:36.134
One that scares you.

35:36.962 --> 35:39.654
One that hurts people.

35:41.069 --> 35:43.106
You keep running from it.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.489
You can't get away.

35:46.558 --> 35:48.663
It follows you.

35:48.663 --> 35:51.390
It follows you everywhere.

35:53.358 --> 35:55.498
It's already here.

35:57.603 --> 35:59.122
[vomit splatters]

36:02.367 --> 36:04.127
I wanna go home.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.282
-Ugh!

what to say.

picture of you, Kathelia.

Can you paint
your family for me?

36:45.306 --> 36:48.171
[soft ethereal music]

37:02.668 --> 37:04.912
That's Robin,
am I right?

-[Daniel] [chuckles]

37:06.396 --> 37:08.087

is in your family?

swings before?

38:22.058 --> 38:24.163
Okay, okay.

38:24.163 --> 38:25.820
You can do it on your own,
but watch out.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.650
You might
swing all the way around.

38:27.650 --> 38:29.272
[whistling]

38:42.147 --> 38:43.804
-We made a mistake.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.807
Getting Kathelia.

38:49.154 --> 38:50.535
I wanted to believe that

38:50.604 --> 38:52.847
we were rescuing her
from something,

38:52.847 --> 38:56.368
and that if we gave her
everything...

38:56.437 --> 38:58.508
that she could possibly need,

38:58.543 --> 39:00.130
that it would be enough.

39:00.165 --> 39:03.030
-But it's not.
-Okay, let's just, uh...

39:04.997 --> 39:06.965
Just hold on
for one second.

39:06.999 --> 39:09.208
-I don't know how
to help her!

39:09.243 --> 39:11.038
-We have to give it time.
-I don't have time.

39:11.072 --> 39:12.867
-We have not given it time.
-I don't have time!

39:12.867 --> 39:13.834
-She's been abandoned
by everyone else

39:13.868 --> 39:14.904
in her entire life.
-I don't care!

39:14.904 --> 39:16.940
She's dangerous, Daniel.
-She's eight years old!

39:16.975 --> 39:18.632
-Her mother was psychotic!

39:19.633 --> 39:21.911
Do you really want
to risk it?

39:21.980 --> 39:25.466
She could hurt me, Daniel.

39:26.812 --> 39:28.331
And not just me.

what I warned you about!

Get off me.

I want her out
of this house, Daniel!

-The way that you
just behaved

42:39.557 --> 42:41.904
is unacceptable, okay?

42:41.904 --> 42:43.112
You cannot act like that.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.872
She will send you back
to child services like that.

42:44.907 --> 42:47.910
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

42:47.910 --> 42:50.222
No. Please.

42:50.222 --> 42:52.362
Stop. Stop.

42:52.777 --> 42:53.847
Stop, stop.

42:53.881 --> 42:55.814
No. Stop!

42:57.505 --> 42:59.577
I'm sorry. Just...

43:03.028 --> 43:05.859
Look, I don't know
what it's like to be you, okay?

43:05.893 --> 43:07.136
I have no idea.

43:07.205 --> 43:10.208
You've been through things
that I cannot imagine.

43:11.554 --> 43:14.453
But we are not the enemy.

Okay? Robin and I,
we are trying to give you

43:17.422 --> 43:22.116
a life that is safe
and--and that is loving.

43:22.151 --> 43:26.465
But Robin, she's my family.

She's my wife,
and I have to protect her too.

I need you to stop
doing what you're doing.

43:33.956 --> 43:35.440

Can you do that?

I'm just here to--

-[Woman] I don't know you.

Look, I was, uh...

I'm sorry to bother you.

47:04.683 --> 47:05.684
I was just...

47:05.753 --> 47:08.135
My foster daughter,
she gave me your address.

47:08.170 --> 47:12.760
And I don't even know why
I'm here, so...

47:12.795 --> 47:15.763
-[Woman] Huh, a mystery!

47:18.214 --> 47:19.906

bother you, ma'am.

48:02.155 --> 48:04.916

48:04.985 --> 48:06.366
I don't get company much.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.057
I forget how to act.

48:08.057 --> 48:09.748
I'd offer you
a glass of sweet tea,

48:31.839 --> 48:33.841
So handsome.

48:33.876 --> 48:38.294
Now, what's this about
a foster daughter?

48:38.363 --> 48:41.021
-Kathelia Harris.
I think she knows you.

48:42.402 --> 48:45.923
-[laughing]
Oh, I know Kathelia.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.096
Always so quiet,

48:47.131 --> 48:49.029
you hardly even know
she's there.

48:49.064 --> 48:50.720
-[nervous chuckle]

48:50.755 --> 48:54.483
-But don't let
your guard down. Ever.

48:54.552 --> 48:57.451
-[nervous chuckle] Yeah.
Uh, me and my wife,

48:57.451 --> 49:01.317
we are...
having some trouble with her.

49:01.386 --> 49:03.457
-[Evelyn]
Yeah, she's a tricky one.

49:03.457 --> 49:04.976
Always getting into something,

49:05.045 --> 49:08.290
can never just sit still
and behave.

49:09.222 --> 49:11.362
Naughty to the bone.

49:12.811 --> 49:18.610
What she needs is
a good swat across the backside.

49:18.610 --> 49:21.061
Where is that little devil?

49:21.096 --> 49:23.167
Did you bring her
to see me?

49:23.236 --> 49:25.134
[menacing music]

49:25.134 --> 49:28.448
-She's at home.
With my wife.

49:31.106 --> 49:34.488
-Oh. Well, now,
that's too bad.

49:34.557 --> 49:37.146
I would have loved to...

49:38.320 --> 49:42.496
Well, you came to see me
after all.

49:42.496 --> 49:45.154
Your new papa's a liar.

49:47.915 --> 49:50.021
Now, come on over here.

49:50.090 --> 49:51.989
Give me a little cuddle.

49:52.506 --> 49:54.405
[screaming]
[thuds]

49:56.200 --> 49:57.511
[thuds]

49:57.580 --> 49:59.686
[screaming]

49:59.755 --> 50:00.825
-[Man] Hey!

50:03.000 --> 50:05.347
Get that girl out of here!

50:05.416 --> 50:07.004
Get her out!

50:08.039 --> 50:10.179
-[Evelyn] [screaming]

50:10.214 --> 50:11.767
-[Man] Get her out of here!

50:11.801 --> 50:12.940
-[screaming]

50:12.975 --> 50:14.977
-Stop it! It's all right.

50:16.737 --> 50:18.049
Hey!
-Put you in the car front.

50:18.118 --> 50:20.189
-What the hell
are you doing?

50:20.189 --> 50:23.330
bringing her here
upsetting my wife?

50:23.365 --> 50:24.849
-Is this how you take care
of a kid, huh?

50:24.849 --> 50:27.024
Locked in there
with a crazy woman?

50:27.024 --> 50:29.198
-My wife has a busted lip
because of that child!

50:29.198 --> 50:31.062
-Your wife
fucking attacked us!

50:31.131 --> 50:32.374
She's deranged!

50:32.408 --> 50:35.342
-Don't you dare!
Don't you say it!

50:35.377 --> 50:36.723
You think you know
who we are?

50:36.757 --> 50:39.070
Who we were before
that girl got here?

50:39.139 --> 50:40.865
You know nothing about us.

50:40.865 --> 50:43.523
Nothing! Or about her.

50:44.869 --> 50:47.320
But you will know.
You will.

50:49.736 --> 50:51.048
-Okay.

50:51.082 --> 50:54.051
-[Joe] You married?
She pregnant yet?

50:54.085 --> 50:57.399
[sinister music]

50:57.433 --> 50:59.090
My wife can't make no babies.

50:59.159 --> 51:00.402
She ain't got the parts.

51:00.402 --> 51:02.749
She lost them to cancer.

51:02.818 --> 51:04.406
But something took
root in her,

51:04.440 --> 51:07.029
something horrible,
as soon as we got that girl.

51:08.237 --> 51:10.929
I used to believe God
looked out over everybody.

51:10.929 --> 51:13.208
But when we got that girl
to the house,

51:13.242 --> 51:16.211
He closed His eyes tight!

51:17.833 --> 51:19.421
Get rid of her
while you can,

51:19.490 --> 51:21.250
any way you can!

51:21.285 --> 51:22.872
[car door slamming]

51:29.914 --> 51:31.743
-[Daniel] Goddamn it!

51:31.743 --> 51:34.091
Sorry.
[exasperated sigh]

51:37.473 --> 51:39.889
You should never,
never have been put

51:39.924 --> 51:41.788
in that home
with those people.

51:44.618 --> 51:49.485
Look, I don't believe
in devils or demons

51:49.554 --> 51:50.969
or whatever it is
he thinks you are.

51:51.038 --> 51:53.248
Those things, they,
they don't exist.

51:57.321 --> 51:58.598
Look...

52:00.462 --> 52:04.811
That man's wife,
she's sick.

52:04.811 --> 52:06.640
He's afraid of
what's coming and--

52:06.675 --> 52:08.470
and he wants someone
to blame.

52:08.504 --> 52:11.438
It's a terrible,
terrible, sad situation.

52:11.438 --> 52:12.957
But you...

52:14.648 --> 52:16.581
You are not
the cause of it.

52:19.343 --> 52:22.415
You, me, Robin.

52:25.625 --> 52:27.144
We're gonna be fine.

52:30.561 --> 52:32.563
-[screaming]

53:03.041 --> 53:04.871
-[Daniel] Stay here.

53:07.632 --> 53:10.670
[foreboding music]

53:22.199 --> 53:23.372
Hey.

53:23.407 --> 53:28.032
[foreboding music continues]

53:33.037 --> 53:34.797
-We wanted this.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.737
-Yeah.

53:54.403 --> 53:56.888
-It's gonna be different
this time.

53:58.787 --> 54:01.652
This baby's
gonna be good for us.

54:02.066 --> 54:04.689
[heartbeat pulsing]

54:06.622 --> 54:09.660
[faint background music]

54:18.427 --> 54:20.912
[door opens]
-[Nurse] Mrs. Hutson?

54:21.258 --> 54:22.673
We're ready to see you.

54:23.846 --> 54:26.780
-Robin, great to see you.

54:28.610 --> 54:30.128
How you feeling?

54:30.197 --> 54:31.613
-Great.

54:32.545 --> 54:35.548
-Good.
How's Daniel doing?

54:37.929 --> 54:39.379
-Good.

54:39.414 --> 54:41.588
-Is he being supportive?

54:45.282 --> 54:46.559
-Yes.

54:48.146 --> 54:52.634
-Good. And I will be
there with you too,

54:52.634 --> 54:54.394
every step of the way.

54:55.326 --> 54:57.052
-Thank you.

54:58.122 --> 55:02.126
I was a little worried
that maybe,

55:02.126 --> 55:03.990
that I lost the baby.

55:04.059 --> 55:05.992
-What do you mean?

55:05.992 --> 55:07.787
-There was blood
on the sheets

55:07.787 --> 55:11.411
and I found this.

55:13.413 --> 55:16.105
-You found this
in the blood?

55:17.624 --> 55:20.662
-[Robin] Yeah, but then
I felt her move so

55:20.662 --> 55:22.733
I knew it was
all okay.

55:23.768 --> 55:27.462
-You...
you felt your baby?

55:27.496 --> 55:30.396
-[Robin] Yeah.
And then this morning...

55:32.329 --> 55:33.916
there was this.

55:46.273 --> 55:47.551
-[soft gasp] Oh.

55:47.620 --> 55:49.622
[clears throat]

55:51.727 --> 55:53.315
Robin, we have to get you

55:53.350 --> 55:55.697
to the hospital
for a full examination today.

55:55.697 --> 55:56.629
-No, no.
I don't need to go

55:56.663 --> 55:57.837
to the hospital.

55:57.837 --> 55:59.010
-Honey, I'm sorry.

55:59.010 --> 56:00.874
You've had a complication.

56:00.874 --> 56:02.876
We have to make certain

56:02.876 --> 56:04.706
there's no immediate health
issue for you.

56:04.706 --> 56:07.881
No, no, no. No.

56:07.916 --> 56:09.987
[nervous chuckle]
I'm pregnant.

56:10.021 --> 56:11.747
-That's not really possible.

56:11.816 --> 56:15.233
-I'm pregnant.
I'm pregnant.

56:15.302 --> 56:17.719
I-I hear my baby's heartbeat.

56:17.788 --> 56:19.755
I-I feel her.

56:19.824 --> 56:23.380
I feel her moving!
She's strong.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.073
[door opens]

56:27.142 --> 56:28.799
-[Doctor] Robin.

56:29.316 --> 56:32.734
Robin! [sighs]

[louder] Kathelia!

57:42.113 --> 57:44.391
[grunting]

57:45.392 --> 57:46.635
Hi.

57:47.809 --> 57:51.260
[sinister music]

57:51.295 --> 57:56.990
I want you to know
that this isn't my fault.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.855
I wanted to
bond with you.

57:59.924 --> 58:01.892
I wanted a family.

58:04.446 --> 58:06.275
It doesn't matter now.

58:08.001 --> 58:10.797
I have all that I want
with this one.

58:14.836 --> 58:18.287
[dramatic music]

58:18.322 --> 58:22.947
Maybe if you scream,
he'll hear you.

58:22.982 --> 58:25.536
You think he'll rescue you?

58:25.605 --> 58:27.538
Go ahead, scream.

58:27.607 --> 58:29.160
Scream for him.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.334
[shouting]
Scream! Come on!

58:30.334 --> 58:31.680
Come on!
Let it out!

58:31.715 --> 58:33.510
Let it out!

58:35.857 --> 58:37.168
Look at us.

58:37.168 --> 58:38.756
Look at us.

58:39.481 --> 58:41.863
It never
would have worked.

58:41.863 --> 58:44.521
You can't
even call me mother.

58:44.521 --> 58:48.179
Let's stop pretending
that we're a family.

58:52.701 --> 58:54.220
Run.

58:54.289 --> 58:55.290
Run!

59:00.157 --> 59:02.573
[grinding]

59:02.642 --> 59:06.888
[faint background music]

59:11.651 --> 59:15.552
-Hey.
Peas in a pod!

59:15.552 --> 59:17.277
Fiona's inside.

59:17.346 --> 59:19.935
Do your parents know
you're here?

59:20.004 --> 59:21.074
Of course they do,

59:21.109 --> 59:23.145
they're fucking
good parents.

59:24.353 --> 59:26.252
[grinding]

59:29.220 --> 59:31.084
[knocking]

59:31.119 --> 59:34.053
-[Fiona] I can't tell you
how to fight it.

59:36.780 --> 59:40.922
I'm sorry.
I don't know how.

59:40.922 --> 59:42.337
[slaps wall]

59:42.371 --> 59:43.752
Don't be mad.

59:43.752 --> 59:48.585
I'll keep trying.
Come up here.

59:48.619 --> 59:51.104
I'm with my friends.

59:51.760 --> 59:56.282
[foreboding music]

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:09.813
These are all
the people who live up here.

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:11.780
I talk to them
sometimes

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.093
when Mama isn't around.

01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:18.304
My friends are over here.

01:00:20.547 --> 01:00:22.204
Come listen.

01:00:30.281 --> 01:00:32.318
[whispering]
Can you hear them?

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:36.909
They say...

01:00:36.943 --> 01:00:39.636
[whispers]

01:00:44.986 --> 01:00:47.989
[soft ethereal music]

01:00:47.989 --> 01:00:49.784
They're coming.

01:01:05.489 --> 01:01:07.905
Tiny specks of color.

01:01:10.252 --> 01:01:12.116
Do you want to meet them?

01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:19.192
Don't be scared.

01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:24.681
[soft dreamy music]

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.215
They like you.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:51.673
[ambient music]

01:01:57.368 --> 01:01:59.681
All your colors.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.035
So beautiful.

-You're a lucky girl.

01:02:35.061 --> 01:02:36.960
No fracture,
no serious bleeding.

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:38.582
Just a purple bump.

01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:40.101
-[soft gasp] That's great.

01:02:40.101 --> 01:02:42.241
-Kids bounce.
It's amazing.

01:02:42.275 --> 01:02:43.794
Complications can occur.

01:02:43.863 --> 01:02:44.933
Keep an eye on her.

01:02:44.933 --> 01:02:48.109
Dizziness, nausea,
anything unusual.

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:50.145
Uh...
one other thing.

01:02:50.214 --> 01:02:52.458
I did see
something curious.

01:02:52.527 --> 01:02:53.942
Not cancer.

01:02:53.977 --> 01:02:55.944
Something old.
A scar.

01:02:55.944 --> 01:02:56.980
I'd like a closer look
at her scans.

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.291
-Uh, is that something

01:02:58.326 --> 01:02:59.637
that we should
be worried about?

01:02:59.637 --> 01:03:01.122
-[Dr. Kumar] No, no.
I'm just being nosy.

01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:02.779
Any news, I'll call.

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.125
For now, my advice:

01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:05.989
if Kathelia
has another play date

01:03:06.058 --> 01:03:09.647
with the uh, hammer girl,
make it supervised.

01:03:10.096 --> 01:03:14.963

She's asleep.

-[Robin] Great.

01:03:40.161 --> 01:03:41.472
-I know you weren't
around to see it,

01:03:41.472 --> 01:03:44.510
but the kid
had a rough day.

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.823
-[Robin] Do you really think
I care?

01:03:47.962 --> 01:03:50.136
-[scoffs] What?

01:03:54.313 --> 01:03:56.349
-I don't love her.

01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:59.766
And you don't love
her either.

01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:03.253
How could you?

01:04:03.287 --> 01:04:04.979
She's not ours.

01:04:06.118 --> 01:04:07.429
-Robin?

01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:11.019
What's going on
with you?

01:04:11.019 --> 01:04:14.022
-I don't want her!

01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:16.128
We have our own
child now.

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:18.544
Our real child.

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:22.375
Kathelia is a parasite.

01:04:22.444 --> 01:04:24.170
[sinister music]

01:04:24.205 --> 01:04:26.379
And she will destroy
this family.

01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:28.243
I won't let that happen.

01:04:28.312 --> 01:04:30.073
You won't even miss her
when she's gone.

01:04:30.142 --> 01:04:32.282
-Look, Robin, I, um...

01:04:33.559 --> 01:04:35.872
I think something
is seriously wrong with you.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.356
I-I think you need help.

01:04:37.356 --> 01:04:39.220
You and the baby.

01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:41.118
-We don't need help.

01:04:42.223 --> 01:04:43.534
We're fucking great.

01:04:43.534 --> 01:04:47.193
[eerie music]

01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:51.922
[Robin humming]

01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:57.134
[Robin grunting, groaning]

01:04:59.585 --> 01:05:02.519
[menacing music]

01:05:25.749 --> 01:05:28.165
[sinister music]

01:05:36.242 --> 01:05:39.936
[cell phone ringing]

01:05:44.285 --> 01:05:45.769
-Yeah?

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.876
[sinister music]

01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:01.785
Rob?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.547
The doctor called.

01:06:07.273 --> 01:06:10.173
He wants to meet
this morning.

01:06:10.242 --> 01:06:13.521
Some... [sighs]

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:15.764
some updates on Kathelia.

01:06:20.804 --> 01:06:22.564
-[Robin] You go.

01:06:25.395 --> 01:06:27.742
[eerie music]

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:29.468
Almost.

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:32.574
Almost, little Jessica.

01:06:33.506 --> 01:06:35.336
-Forgive me
for being so excited.

01:06:35.405 --> 01:06:37.200
I feel, uh...

01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:39.478
If Kathelia hadn't had
her accident,

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:40.962
we never would have known.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.170
-Known what?

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.759
-Please.
You should sit.

01:06:46.933 --> 01:06:48.176
-Okay.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.525
-This is Kathelia's
CT scan.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.837
That's the scar
I mentioned.

01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:55.183
Just a little thing
right there

01:06:55.218 --> 01:06:56.564
in the frontal lobe.

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:59.532
The area of the brain
that creates speech.

01:06:59.532 --> 01:07:01.879
Which is why this
caught my attention.

01:07:01.914 --> 01:07:07.195
When we magnify,
the scar becomes an object.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:08.817
A fetus.

01:07:10.716 --> 01:07:12.028
-A what?

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.376
-Yeah.
Vanishing twin syndrome.

01:07:15.376 --> 01:07:19.380
Bizarre. Very unusual,
but completely natural.

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:21.244
When Kathelia
was in the womb,

01:07:21.313 --> 01:07:23.729
she had a twin sibling
floating happily

01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:25.386
alongside her.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.457
Until Kathelia ate her.

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:30.839
I'm being dramatic.

01:07:30.874 --> 01:07:31.944
But it is horrific.

01:07:32.013 --> 01:07:34.947
Kathelia absorbed her twin
into her own body,

01:07:35.016 --> 01:07:38.054
and the remains
of her sibling lodged here

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.504
in Kathelia's brain.

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:43.714
Obstructing Kathelia's
ability to speak.

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:46.993
You are a sister.

01:07:47.028 --> 01:07:48.892
A very naughty one.

01:07:48.926 --> 01:07:50.721
[chomps]

01:07:50.721 --> 01:07:53.483
[faint background music]

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.731
-Do you wanna go play?

01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:03.907
I get it.

01:08:03.907 --> 01:08:05.253
This week's been
a lot of weird shit.

01:08:05.253 --> 01:08:07.600
[faint background music]
-[Man] Number 47.

01:08:09.257 --> 01:08:10.879
-Be right back.

01:08:14.745 --> 01:08:16.402
Hey.

01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:20.924
[faint background chatter]

01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:29.691

[footsteps approaching]

01:08:38.769 --> 01:08:40.288
Double patty, double cheese,

01:08:40.288 --> 01:08:42.773
extra large fries,

01:08:42.773 --> 01:08:45.293
and a milkshake.

01:08:45.293 --> 01:08:46.812
Oh.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.668
[sighs]

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.981
[beeping]

01:09:23.987 --> 01:09:25.506

-[Robin] [over phone]
[panting] [low growl]

01:09:36.827 --> 01:09:38.519
-Hey. Robin,
are you there?

01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:39.830
-[Robin] [over phone]
[soft gasp]

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.349
-Robin?

01:09:41.384 --> 01:09:43.455
[line beeps]

01:09:47.838 --> 01:09:49.426
I have to go talk to her.

01:09:54.604 --> 01:09:56.882
No. No.

01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:59.471
No.

01:10:01.473 --> 01:10:03.026
Don't let her see you.

01:10:06.685 --> 01:10:08.687
[car door slamming]

01:10:08.687 --> 01:10:11.862
[foreboding music]

01:10:11.862 --> 01:10:13.864
Hey, Rob?

01:10:13.899 --> 01:10:15.866
[water flowing]

01:10:15.866 --> 01:10:18.800

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:21.863
[water gushing]

01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:37.810
-[Robin] You came back
to us.

01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:43.299
No, you didn't.

01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:49.305
-Robin. Robin,

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.790
I think, uh...

01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:54.517
I think we need to get you
to a hospital.

01:11:54.586 --> 01:11:57.589
-It's too late.
She's here.

01:12:02.663 --> 01:12:05.321
[water bubbling]

-Fuck!

01:13:12.249 --> 01:13:14.562
[sniffles] Hey.

01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:17.669
Um, I'm gonna
get you outta here, okay?

01:13:22.087 --> 01:13:24.089
What?

01:13:24.158 --> 01:13:26.919
What? I don't...

01:13:26.919 --> 01:13:28.714
What are you
talking about?

01:13:31.061 --> 01:13:33.650
The doll is...

01:13:33.685 --> 01:13:35.169
you.

01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:41.002
Fiona?

01:13:43.177 --> 01:13:44.489
Fuck!

01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:47.250
Fiona knows?

01:13:47.284 --> 01:13:48.665
Yeah?

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:54.568
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.571

01:14:07.788 --> 01:14:09.410
Hey, Lizzie!

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:13.621
-Fiona's a sweet,
happy girl!

01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:14.933
-[Daniel] Look, I just need
to talk to you for a second.

01:14:14.967 --> 01:14:15.968
-She doesn't hurt people!

01:14:16.003 --> 01:14:17.107
-Look, I'm not trying
to argue or anything.

01:14:17.107 --> 01:14:19.282
I think Fiona knows things.

01:14:19.316 --> 01:14:21.457
In ways that...

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.803
Fuck, I can't even believe

01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:24.460
that I'm fucking saying
this right now.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.671
Something terrible is happening

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.294
to my family,
and Fiona knows what.

01:14:32.122 --> 01:14:34.608
So I just...
I need your help.

01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:40.234
-Hey, Kathelia...

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.995
Fiona's upstairs.

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.170
Would you mind
getting her for us?

01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:47.483
She won't bite.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.001
Thank you, darlin'.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:52.004
-So... what?

01:14:52.004 --> 01:14:53.143
Are--are you gonna
tell me

01:14:53.178 --> 01:14:55.836
that angels gave
Fiona a gift?

01:14:55.836 --> 01:14:57.147
-No, no angels.

01:14:57.147 --> 01:14:59.495
I fucked her up
all on my own.

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:01.462
When I got pregnant
with Fiona,

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.670
I was a mess.

01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:04.879
I had been for a while.

01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:07.848
Doctors told me
she wasn't developing normally.

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:09.677
I didn't think
I could love her right.

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.507
I had nothing
to give her.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.818
So...

01:15:14.855 --> 01:15:17.374
I tried to fix both of us
the only way I knew.

01:15:18.997 --> 01:15:21.275
I died.
Fiona didn't.

01:15:22.863 --> 01:15:26.349
I was still in the hospital
when Fiona was born.

01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:29.352
[laughing] I had never seen
such a sunny baby, man.

01:15:29.352 --> 01:15:32.631
I couldn't believe
she came from me.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:35.358
She was light.
Still is.

01:15:36.704 --> 01:15:39.880
When she was five,
her pet cat died.

01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:44.229
I was wrecked,
but not Fiona.

01:15:44.263 --> 01:15:47.059
To her the cat
wasn't any different.

01:15:47.059 --> 01:15:48.716
A few weeks after that,

01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.649
she started spending time
with her dad,

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:52.409
who I knew was dead.

01:15:53.514 --> 01:15:55.378
And I got it.

01:15:55.378 --> 01:15:58.899
For Fiona, life, death

01:15:58.933 --> 01:16:00.728
they're the same thing.

01:16:00.728 --> 01:16:04.249
She lives in both worlds.
Sees both.

01:16:04.283 --> 01:16:07.217
-[Fiona] You're more fun
to play with--

01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:08.564
-Hey, starlight!

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:09.565
Come here. Come here.

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:11.981
You remember Kathelia's dad?

01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:13.223
-[Daniel] Hey.

01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:17.918
-[Fiona] You saw a monster.

01:16:19.782 --> 01:16:22.094
Not the real one.

01:16:22.163 --> 01:16:24.165
Not the one in Kathelia.

01:16:26.029 --> 01:16:27.686
Look, you--you
gave me this.

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:29.964
-[Fiona] It's Kathelia.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:31.966
This? No, this...

01:16:32.035 --> 01:16:34.935
Who is this?
This isn't Kathelia.

01:16:34.935 --> 01:16:37.593
-She didn't say her name.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.422
Just ugly things.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:43.599
I hurt you so
you could find it.

01:16:44.945 --> 01:16:46.256
-Okay, so...

01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:49.777
this...

01:16:49.812 --> 01:16:52.469
monster... thing,

01:16:52.469 --> 01:16:56.439
is that...
is that what's hurting my wife?

01:16:56.439 --> 01:16:57.923
-Yes.

01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:00.063
-So what do I do?

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:10.315
-Okay. We're gonna need
one more drink.

01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:12.662
And then maybe
we can all go upstairs

01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:14.457
and talk to the monster?

01:17:14.457 --> 01:17:16.942
[haunting music]

01:17:36.306 --> 01:17:37.653
-Who are they?

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.760
-[whispering] Dead people.

01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:47.179
-Right. So we're talking to...

01:17:47.179 --> 01:17:49.354
-[whispering] Just buckle up.

01:17:49.354 --> 01:17:51.805
-What, like ghosts
or something?

01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:56.706
-[Fiona] No ghost.
Ghosts were alive.

01:17:56.775 --> 01:17:59.536
The monster wasn't born.
