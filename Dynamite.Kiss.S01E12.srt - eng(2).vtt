DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:52.782
EPISODE 12

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.118
Look at it. I'm fine.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.953
-What are we going to do about your wrist?
-Excuse me.

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:03.376
I'm sorry.

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:06.087
It's okay. No one got hurt.

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.380
Why are you crying?

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:08.798
I'm sorry.

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:10.466
I'm sorry.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.467
My goodness.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.348
After the divorce, my ex-husband
stopped paying for child support.

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.642
I needed a proper job,

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.228
so I applied to Natural BeBe.

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:25.732
Was it to the Mother TF Team?

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.233
Yes.

00:01:27.317 --> 00:01:31.029
I was an assistant manager
at another baby product company,

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:32.864
so I had high hopes,

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:35.450
but my application didn't pass.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.660
I was devastated.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:42.373
I felt utterly useless.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:46.169
That's not true.

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:49.923
I think I took out my anger about my life
on Natural BeBe.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.050
I posted malicious comments
on online mom communities

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.385
and called customer service

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.596
to curse out the representatives
and make issues out of nothing.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.975
I'll gladly accept
any punishment you see fit.

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:03.478
I'll also post on the online communities

00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:07.065
and come clean about what I did
and explain that it was all fabricated.

00:02:07.148 --> 00:02:08.650
I'm really sorry.

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:13.363
Gosh, I'm hungry.

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:15.114
What should we eat for dinner?

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:16.991
Sushi?

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.618
Or pasta?

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:19.577
Fried chicken?

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:22.872
I'm fine. I'm not really hungry.

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:27.961
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:34.801
Da-rim.

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.303
Everything worked out.

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:38.930
It's done.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.224
Okay?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.436
Okay?

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:50.191
I probably took
Ms. Lee So-yeong's spot, right?

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.948
If I didn't lie to get hired,

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.743
she would've been on the team.

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:02.662
You're reading too much into it.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.455
Even if it wasn't her,

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:06.290
I'm sure

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.503
someone more qualified
would've gotten my spot.

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:12.714
And that someone

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.093
could've been in a more urgent
and desperate situation than me.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.597
It makes me question
the choices I've made.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.325
Well done, everyone.

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:43.453
-Good job, everyone!
-We're done.

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:45.580
-It's over now, Da-rim.
-Team dinner tonight?

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:46.831
How about a refreshing beer?

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:48.249
-That sounds so nice.
-Excellent idea.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:49.667
-Right, Mr. Kang?
-What should we eat?

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:51.669
-Grilled intestines.
-Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:54.088
How's your injury?

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.674
It's healing.

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:58.343
Is that so?

00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:03.097
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.599
NAME: GO DA-RIM
STATUS: UNMARRIED

00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:13.983
Is this real?

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:15.568
Yeah.

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:16.986
That woman

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.031
-was never married.
-What?

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.657
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS
NAME: GO DA-RIM, STATUS: UNMARRIED

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:26.537
Are you saying she lied to get a job?

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.790
You shouldn't be angry at her.

00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:30.291
You should actually be thankful.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.209
Why would I?

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:32.460
She created an opportunity.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.839
An opportunity
to completely crush Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:42.053
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:49.811
You must've been so upset.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:52.605
The company should've taken
better preventive measures.

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:54.649
It's okay, ma'am.

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:56.859
The company is wholly at fault for this.

00:04:57.443 --> 00:04:59.904
Speaking of which,
let me formally request that we establish

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:01.697
clear guidelines for protecting CS staff

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.242
and implement mental-health support.

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:05.910
That's a good idea.

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:07.203
We'll work on that.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.373
-Oh my. Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

00:05:15.628 --> 00:05:16.504
Also,

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:19.173
we'd like for you
to do a press interview, Ms. Go.

00:05:19.257 --> 00:05:20.133
Is that okay with you?

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:22.427
-Pardon?
-You need to clear your name.

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:26.431
I think it'd be even better

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:28.182
if you do it with Mr. Kim Seon-u
as a couple.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.726
You could even talk about
working together.

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:35.189
A press interview?
Does it mean she's going to be on TV?

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.817
You'll be famous nationwide.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.985
You have to do it, no matter what.

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:42.613
Then I'll schedule one
as soon as possible.

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:44.240
That might be difficult.

00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:49.245
Ms. Lee So-yeong will inevitably come up
during the interview.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:51.080
If the issue is highlighted again,

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.166
she'll come under fire.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:57.461
She already confessed and apologized.

00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:00.423
Do we have any reason
to push her to the brink?

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:04.510
I agree with him.
I think it'd be best not to do it.

00:06:06.262 --> 00:06:07.096
Is that so?

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:13.769
All right then.

00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:16.689
But let us at least post an announcement
on the company bulletin board.

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:18.733
To highlight your exceptional service.

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:20.860
You'd be okay with that much, right?

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:22.236
Yes.

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.077
You were right.

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:32.914
Ji-hyeok knows Go Da-rim

00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.916
is single.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:37.627
Well done.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.837
Just keep praising him
and stroking his ego.

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:43.382
The higher he rises…

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.179
the more painful it'll be when he falls.

00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.482
Ms. Go, we saw the announcement
on the company bulletin board.

00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:01.651
Congratulations on being
Employee of the Month.

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:02.944
Did you get that injury
while saving the baby?

00:07:03.527 --> 00:07:04.362
You're so cool.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:07.031
Gosh, I'm flattered.
I didn't do anything special.

00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:09.075
Ms. Go, our Employee of the Month,

00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:12.870
always had a strong moral compass
and acted with sincerity.

00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:15.414
Of course.
Ms. Go, our Employee of the Month,

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:17.166
is known for her unwavering
sense of responsibility.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.376
That's right.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:19.544
Enjoy your lunch.

00:07:19.627 --> 00:07:22.004
-Thank you. You too.
-You too.

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:27.927
You're the Employee of the Month's
team leader.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.970
How does it feel?

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:30.888
Well…

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:34.559
It feels nice.

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:37.603
I see.

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:40.314
You know, Da-rim loves beef.

00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:42.024
Come on now, Go-eun.

00:07:42.108 --> 00:07:43.859
You don't need to say that out loud.

00:07:43.943 --> 00:07:47.947
There's no way Mr. Gong would just ignore
such a momentous occasion.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.908
After all, Ms. Go,
our Employee of the Month,

00:07:50.992 --> 00:07:53.244
brought such prestige to our team.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.622
Of course. If he's at all grateful,
he can't just ignore it.

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:58.040
-For sure.
-For sure.

00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:00.334
You all should know better now.

00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:01.711
Mr. Gong would never.

00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:05.131
-There's no way.
-There's no way.

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:06.882
It's time for a proper team dinner.

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:08.467
Beef.

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:11.304
It'll be my treat.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.977
-Gong Ji-hyeok!
-Gong Ji-hyeok!

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.895
I'll search for a restaurant immediately.

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:20.896
Korean beef.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.523
-Korean beef?
-Yes, please.

00:08:22.607 --> 00:08:24.025
Might as well go all out.

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:27.486
-That sounds so nice.
-We might as well if we can.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.031
Let's step out for coffee.

00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:32.241
-It'll be my treat.
-Oh my gosh.

00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:34.827
That's the Employee of the Month's
assistant manager for you.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.871
You can tell you're a learned man.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:37.872
Come on, Da-rim.

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:41.417
Sorry, I think I'll pass.
I don't feel too great.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.919
You guys go ahead.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.801
She barely ate her food.

00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:54.180
What's going on?
She's turning down free coffee?

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:59.435
This is totally your style, right?

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:01.646
But you always wear stuff like this.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:05.191
What a pretty color.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.531
You said you had a kid
who goes to daycare, right?

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:14.825
-Yes.
-Great.

00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:16.494
Can you suggest an outfit for me?

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.329
Something suitable

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:22.041
for a talent show at a daycare.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.292
Pardon? Where?

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:27.713
Gosh, that's so pretty.

00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:29.048
-You think so?
-Yeah.

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.010
A talent show.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:34.470
Show?

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:36.013
You're going to a show?

00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:36.931
What?

00:09:37.515 --> 00:09:39.767
Yeah, I'm going to a friend's show.

00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:43.521
I mean, a friend's party.

00:09:43.604 --> 00:09:45.606
Right, so what sort of party?

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.691
What's the theme?

00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:51.445
The theme is

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.406
just a gathering of friends.

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:56.701
We'll be singing and dancing.
I guess you can call that the theme.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.538
Okay. You should've asked me.
That's my specialty.

00:10:01.247 --> 00:10:03.541
Let's see here.

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:04.458
Oh my.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:07.169
This one's great.

00:10:07.253 --> 00:10:10.756
Well, you see, the guests at the party

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.341
will be on the young side.

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:13.884
That might be a bit too much.

00:10:13.968 --> 00:10:14.927
They're young?

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.845
How young?

00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:17.138
Well…

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:20.474
They're a lot younger than I am.

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:22.893
Listen.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.479
Don't be intimidated.

00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:30.276
You need to go all out
when you're with a younger crowd.

00:10:31.569 --> 00:10:34.155
Can you show us
a few more party dresses like this?

00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:35.197
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:41.287 --> 00:10:43.414
-Goodbye, Jun.
-Bye, Jun!

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:45.166
Bye.

00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:47.293
Jun, your dad should be here soon.

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:49.295
We'll wait with you.

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:51.130
Jun!

00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:53.841
Hello.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:55.718
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:58.053
My goodness, did you wait long?

00:10:58.137 --> 00:10:59.221
I'm sorry.

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:01.307
I had to pick up the guitar from a friend.

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:03.517
It's fine.

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:04.769
Let's go home.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.104
Give me your bag.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.069
Why the long face?

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.905
What happened?

00:11:16.447 --> 00:11:19.200
Did seeing your friends rehearse
make you nervous?

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:21.035
-No.
-Don't worry about a thing.

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:23.621
I'm an excellent guitarist.

00:11:25.998 --> 00:11:28.959
I'm sure all your friends
will end up becoming jealous of you.

00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.422
Let's go and practice.

00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:34.673
-Should we?
-Yeah.

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:36.175
Let's go!

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:39.637
NEW SPRING WOODS KINDERGARTEN

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.888
Be careful.

00:11:41.722 --> 00:11:43.098
All right, all right.

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.935
I'll come visit
when Da-rim has some free time.

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:48.395
Don't even get me started.

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:52.358
That company can't run without Da-rim.

00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:54.026
She's so busy.

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:55.611
All right, take care.

00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:57.154
Bye.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.282
I'm home.

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:01.283
Da-rim.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.118
Come here.

00:12:03.202 --> 00:12:05.621
I was just on the phone
with your aunt Myeong-ja,

00:12:05.704 --> 00:12:07.706
and she insists we come by to visit.

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.459
You know,
for the fresh country air and stuff.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.586
That sounds nice.

00:12:14.088 --> 00:12:17.091
It's been a while since I last saw her.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.635
We saw her often when Dad was alive.

00:12:20.135 --> 00:12:22.221
We used to have
marsh snail-catching contests.

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:23.347
That's right.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.099
You and your dad always won.

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:27.977
You wouldn't stop
even in the freezing cold.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.936
Who could beat that?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.396
Did I?

00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:35.401
You really take after your dad.

00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:39.780
He'd be so proud of you.

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:42.992
You're hardworking, tenacious,

00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:45.494
and honest, just like him.

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.708
Oh, it's time for dinner.

00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:01.719
LIVE WITH HONESTY

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:04.471
Dad.

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:08.142
Sorry.

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:12.980
LIVE WITH HONESTY

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:25.993
MOTHER TF TEAM CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT

00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:32.583
2025 MOTHER TF TEAM CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:47.097
YANG HUI-SUK, LEE GO-EUN, GO DA-RIM

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:50.351
EVALUATOR: MA JONG-GU
RESULT: PASS

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:53.687
FAIL

00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:01.046
MOTHER TF TEAM
GO DA-RIM

00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.066
I HEREBY SUBMIT MY RESIGNATION AS OF
MAY 21, 2025 DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.986
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:33.996
I'm on board too.

00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:39.084
I think we can trust him
with the development of the new product.

00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:41.545
There won't be much
internal pushback either.

00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:43.797
He handled the recent
mom-community incident well,

00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.049
so our public opinion is good too.

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:48.302
Look at how she's backing you up.

00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:50.137
I expect you to show proper results.

00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:53.599
Enough to silence any board opposition
about you becoming vice president.

00:15:56.935 --> 00:15:58.729
Then I'd like to make a request.

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:00.064
What is it?

00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:01.440
If this project is a success,

00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.276
please renew the contracts

00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:08.405
of all my team members
as full-time employees.

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:11.742
Why do you keep insisting on
helping those women?

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.787
We still have some time
before their internships end, right?

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.830
Yes, we do.

00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:20.834
But having his team members
become full-time employees

00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:21.919
when he gets promoted

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:24.963
might be better overall.

00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:26.423
Right.

00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:28.509
To complement
the inauguration ceremony, huh?

00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:30.594
All right, go ahead.

00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:31.512
Yes, sir.

00:16:39.603 --> 00:16:40.437
Ji-hyeok.

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.025
You can do this, right?

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:46.401
Of course, I can.

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:50.030
I trust my team members
more than I trust myself.

00:16:51.698 --> 00:16:53.283
That's why I'm so grateful for you.

00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:55.661
-What?
-You hired them yourself.

00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:59.665
They're all so talented in their own ways.

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.126
You really have a good eye for people.

00:17:05.003 --> 00:17:06.630
-Don't mention it.
-Keep it up.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:22.229
Developing new products
is a core business of our company.

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:24.731
Can we take on such an important task?

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:26.066
Why not?

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:29.111
We've done pretty well for ourselves.

00:17:29.194 --> 00:17:30.028
He's right.

00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:32.156
There were always
a few obstacles in the way,

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:33.824
but we've always produced good results.

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:35.993
I believe we can do this.

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:38.495
Right, Da-rim?

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.916
I'm not sure

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.211
if this is the right time
for me to say this,

00:17:47.212 --> 00:17:50.090
but I have to tell you--

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.091
Before that,

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.885
there's one more important announcement.

00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.220
-An important announcement?
-What is it?

00:17:55.304 --> 00:17:56.305
What's more important than this?

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:58.098
If this project succeeds,

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:00.017
I've gotten the approval

00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:03.687
to make all of you full-time employees.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.772
-Really?
-Full-time employees?

00:18:05.856 --> 00:18:09.026
-Oh my. I can't believe this.
-Full-time employees!

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.196
We have Go Da-rim,
the Employee of the Month,

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:13.780
so of course we'll succeed.

00:18:13.864 --> 00:18:15.073
Let's do our best, Da-rim.

00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:18.619
Everyone, let's all become
full-time employees!

00:18:18.702 --> 00:18:19.786
Let's do it!

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:22.623
I can't believe this!

00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:26.293
-I'm going to work really hard.
-Where do we begin?

00:18:26.877 --> 00:18:30.547
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.465
Mr. Gong.

00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:34.468
I don't think I can continue working here.

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:36.220
I'm sorry.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.264
I won't take this.

00:18:40.182 --> 00:18:42.267
I appreciate the concern,

00:18:43.352 --> 00:18:44.895
but I've made up my mind.

00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:47.231
With my mom out of the hospital,

00:18:47.314 --> 00:18:48.607
a couple of part-time jobs

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:52.486
should be enough to make
the interest payments and what I owe you.

00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:53.487
It's not about money.

00:18:58.992 --> 00:19:00.535
All applicants with notable
academic backgrounds,

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:02.120
experience, and qualifications

00:19:02.204 --> 00:19:03.997
were cut
during the application screening stage.

00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:09.461
They even chose the ones
with the lowest interview scores.

00:19:09.544 --> 00:19:10.462
Me included.

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:12.589
Why did they do that?

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:13.507
From the start,

00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:16.468
they weren't looking
to make a proper team.

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:21.515
So everyone was right.

00:19:22.683 --> 00:19:25.185
A loser team just for show.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:26.436
That was true at first.

00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:28.563
If I'm being honest,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.650
that's what I thought as well.

00:19:33.068 --> 00:19:34.361
Right.

00:19:34.444 --> 00:19:36.530
When everyone had given up on this team,

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:39.199
there was one person

00:19:40.993 --> 00:19:42.452
who didn't.

00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:45.163
Do you know who that is?

00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:49.334
It's you, Da-rim.

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:53.547
Are you just going to let people
look down on you?

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.090
Without even putting up a fight?

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:56.049
This report

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:59.886
is the result of us running around
and putting our heads together.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.557
For them, this job and this report

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:06.268
are their livelihoods and lifelines.

00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:13.233
JANG JIN-HUI, LEE GO-EUN,
GO DA-RIM, BAE NAN-SUK

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:28.040
Da-rim,

00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.292
you basically made our team.

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:32.878
You didn't steal

00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:35.297
someone else's spot.

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:40.510
You led this team to where it is now

00:20:42.012 --> 00:20:43.847
and saved it from fading away.

00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:50.896
Ms. Bae Nan-suk.

00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:52.939
Ms. Jang Jin-hui.

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:54.649
Ms. Lee Go-eun.

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:57.986
Help them become

00:20:58.695 --> 00:20:59.696
full-time employees here.

00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:02.366
You can resign after that.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:04.868
All right?

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.164
Okay.

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:12.209
Until then,

00:21:13.085 --> 00:21:15.212
I'll do my absolute best.

00:21:41.863 --> 00:21:43.657
What did I just see?
What's wrong with my eyes?

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.075
Am I overworked?

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.082
What's wrong with them?
Why are they hugging?

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:54.584
No, this can't be true.

00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:55.794
Oh my goodness.

00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:57.546
This can't be happening.

00:21:57.629 --> 00:21:59.714
Why are they hugging? Why?

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:01.591
I'm serious!

00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:03.009
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:05.887
I'm not. I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:07.013
With Mr. Gong?

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:08.849
-There's no way.
-I know what I saw.

00:22:08.932 --> 00:22:11.143
-They were hugging.
-Then what about Mr. Kim?

00:22:11.226 --> 00:22:12.978
-How could she bring him here?
-Spread out!

00:22:17.357 --> 00:22:18.733
Do you have a cold?

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.819
Do you want something warm to drink?

00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:23.947
No, it's fine.
We were just talking about work.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.908
Oh, right.

00:22:27.492 --> 00:22:28.702
Mr. Gong suggested

00:22:28.785 --> 00:22:30.954
we all attend the baby fair
to brainstorm ideas

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.664
for the new product.

00:22:32.747 --> 00:22:35.125
Oh, I see. It sounds like

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:37.544
Mr. Gong made sure to only tell you that.

00:22:38.545 --> 00:22:42.174
You two seem to have
a lot of conversations.

00:22:42.674 --> 00:22:43.508
What?

00:22:43.592 --> 00:22:47.137
It just seems like you and Mr. Gong

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.890
have become exceptionally close recently.

00:22:49.973 --> 00:22:53.560
Does it? I haven't noticed any changes.

00:22:53.643 --> 00:22:54.603
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:58.523
Mr. Gong asked if we'd all be down
to go for a team dinner tonight.

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:01.818
Will Mr. Kim be there as well?

00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:04.863
No, it's going to be just us.

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:07.157
That's so cold.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.242
Mr. Kim didn't even hesitate
to participate in the campaign

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:11.203
for you and our team.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:12.871
How could you not invite him?

00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:15.165
Forget it.

00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.292
I won't be joining.

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:20.712
I can't either. I have plans.

00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:23.715
I'm going to spend some quality time
with my husband.

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:37.812
Next up is a performance
by the Moon Class,

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:39.773
"Heart, Heart, Mwah."

00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:45.528
-Please give us a round of applause!
-Please give us a round of applause!

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:51.451
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:54.955
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy

00:23:55.038 --> 00:23:57.958
-I really love you, I really love you
-I really love you, I really love you

00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.293
-I don't know why I love you so
-I don't know why I love you so

00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:03.672
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah

00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:07.300
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:08.927
Even when I see you over and over

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.262
And every day

00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:12.347
Heart, mwah

00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:15.850
Even when I see you over and over

00:24:15.934 --> 00:24:16.935
Hey, Jun!

00:24:17.018 --> 00:24:18.144
Jun!

00:24:18.228 --> 00:24:20.146
You're so cute. Oh my gosh!

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.148
Good job, Jun!

00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:24.734
You're the best! You're adorable!

00:24:24.818 --> 00:24:26.528
-Let's look over here.
-There, there.

00:24:26.611 --> 00:24:29.030
-Let's look over here.
-Just one.

00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:31.157
Ji-ho.

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:35.287
Ji-ho, can you look this way?

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.956
-Over here. Let's look here.
-There, there.

00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:44.421
Next, we'll welcome Kim Jun and his father
to the stage for their performance

00:24:44.504 --> 00:24:45.880
of "Island Baby."

00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:56.349
Can we please have Jun's father
come to the stage?

00:25:10.905 --> 00:25:12.115
Mr. Kim?

00:25:13.992 --> 00:25:15.660
I guess he's not here yet.

00:25:15.744 --> 00:25:18.621
-The next performers are ready, right?
-Yes.

00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:22.500
Jun, let's have the next team go first,

00:25:22.584 --> 00:25:24.627
and then you can go after that, okay?

00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:26.296
Wait!

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:29.632
I can do it. That's okay, right?

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:31.509
Who are you?

00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:33.136
I'm…

00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:35.347
Jun's best friend.

00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:42.270
You got this.

00:25:42.354 --> 00:25:43.188
Let's do it.

00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:05.335
When Mom goes to the shade of the island

00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:11.883
To pick oysters

00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:18.515
The baby stays behind alone

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.563
And keeps watch over the house

00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:35.782
-The sea sings
-The sea sings

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.830
-A lullaby
-A lullaby

00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:47.085
-The baby rests their head on their arm
-The baby rests their head on their arm

00:26:48.962 --> 00:26:53.091
-And falls asleep
-And falls asleep

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:59.806
-And falls asleep
-And falls asleep

00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:16.114
Hello.

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:18.032
-Jun.
-Dad!

00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:21.286
My goodness.
Be careful, you're going to hurt yourself.

00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:27.667
Dad, why were you late today?

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.710
Sorry.

00:27:28.793 --> 00:27:31.504
I'm really sorry about today.

00:27:31.588 --> 00:27:34.174
But still, I saw you sing up there.

00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:36.176
You were incredible.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.054
I would've been in big trouble
if it weren't for the pretty lady.

00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:45.185
Thank you.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.770
How did you know about this?

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:50.356
Jun invited me.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.358
Jun and I decided to become best friends.

00:27:53.318 --> 00:27:54.527
Bang!

00:28:19.928 --> 00:28:22.388
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, DAD

00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:37.820
It's hot.

00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:39.739
Thank you.

00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:46.162
You have such a lovely home.

00:28:49.374 --> 00:28:50.500
Thank you

00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:52.877
for standing in for me today
at Jun's performance.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.005
I think Jun had a lot of fun,
thanks to you.

00:28:56.089 --> 00:28:59.217
Right? Jun and I were in perfect sync.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.218
But…

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:04.138
please don't do this again.

00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:06.099
Sorry?

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:07.767
You and I

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:10.812
will have no reason
to see each other after this exhibition.

00:29:11.688 --> 00:29:13.231
But Jun is still a kid.

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:16.776
He won't understand
why he can't see you anymore,

00:29:17.986 --> 00:29:19.320
and he could get hurt.

00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:21.990
Then we can just continue
to see each other.

00:29:23.032 --> 00:29:24.200
I already told you.

00:29:24.784 --> 00:29:26.953
I like you and Jun.

00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:32.917
I have no interest in you as a woman.

00:29:34.168 --> 00:29:35.461
So,

00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:37.714
please don't give false hope to Jun.

00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:42.176
Please.

00:29:57.775 --> 00:29:58.610
My apologies.

00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:00.028
Seriously?

00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:02.989
Wait.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:05.033
Sorry, Tae-yeong.

00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:06.451
I have an urgent meeting.

00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:09.996
You haven't changed a bit.
Your apologies are never sincere.

00:30:12.624 --> 00:30:15.251
You were always like that
when you snatched up the companies

00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:16.377
I was in talks with first.

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.421
You knew how much I had invested

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.673
in those deals valued at billions,
trillions even.

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.133
But you just acted and apologized

00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:25.386
like you bumped into me on the streets
or something.

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:28.097
"Sorry, Tae-yeong."

00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:32.977
I'm glad that came across well.

00:30:33.686 --> 00:30:34.646
You're right.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:36.022
I wasn't really sorry.

00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:37.857
Even if it weren't for me,

00:30:39.192 --> 00:30:40.818
you could never have closed those deals.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:42.862
Yeah?

00:30:43.863 --> 00:30:45.698
People can instinctively tell

00:30:45.782 --> 00:30:47.825
the difference between someone
who will help them grow

00:30:48.952 --> 00:30:50.286
or devour them.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.287
And you see,

00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:53.414
you make it too obvious.

00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:55.208
You have the look of a beast

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:57.794
standing over its prey.

00:30:59.337 --> 00:31:01.464
Yeah, that's it.

00:31:06.844 --> 00:31:07.679
Watch it.

00:31:07.762 --> 00:31:09.764
Just one more thing before I do.

00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:10.974
When it comes to elevators,

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:12.558
it's exit first

00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:14.727
and enter after.

00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:16.896
That's basic etiquette.

00:31:18.898 --> 00:31:20.775
You should at least have basic manners.

00:31:22.026 --> 00:31:22.860
Okay.

00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:24.696
See you.

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.164
Hi.

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:38.584
What are you doing here again?

00:31:38.668 --> 00:31:40.044
Back to interrogate me?

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:43.339
Why so cold? We're on the same team now.

00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:45.008
What? Same team?

00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:48.177
What's with the face?

00:31:48.928 --> 00:31:49.762
It's nothing.

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:52.098
How's it going?

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.392
Well, I did as you said

00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:57.228
and let Ji-hyeok handle
the new product development.

00:31:58.187 --> 00:32:00.773
But what if it's successful?

00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:02.859
Wouldn't that be bad for us?

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:06.195
Wait, was that Mr. Yu's idea?

00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:09.991
We need to make sure that doesn't happen.

00:32:10.074 --> 00:32:12.493
I thought you said we're on the same team.
Why did you tell her to do such a thing?

00:32:12.577 --> 00:32:14.120
Stay out of his way and support him.

00:32:14.203 --> 00:32:15.288
-Pardon?
-What?

00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:16.205
This is our chance.

00:32:16.289 --> 00:32:18.666
Our chance to use
that Go Da-rim card properly.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.251
And don't worry.

00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:22.086
Even if they produce something amazing,

00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:25.423
it'll never see the light of day.

00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:35.141
Instead of overthinking it
and obsessing over newness,

00:32:35.224 --> 00:32:38.770
I thought we could find an older product
and give it an update.

00:32:38.853 --> 00:32:40.104
We could each take one--

00:32:40.188 --> 00:32:42.273
Who cares about our opinions?

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:44.233
We'll follow your lead on everything.

00:32:44.984 --> 00:32:45.818
What?

00:32:45.902 --> 00:32:47.653
You're the fountain of ideas on our team.

00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:49.405
-That's right.
-You are.

00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:50.490
Absolutely.

00:32:50.573 --> 00:32:53.785
What are you talking about?
We always did everything together.

00:32:54.535 --> 00:32:57.997
-First, we should divide the categories--
-You should tell her.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:00.291
-But you're the oldest.
-Be quiet.

00:33:00.374 --> 00:33:02.794
-You saw it.
-You saw it, so you speak up.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.339
-No, you tell her.
-I don't even know if that's true.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.674
Listen.

00:33:10.134 --> 00:33:11.636
There's something…

00:33:13.429 --> 00:33:16.099
I want to tell you.

00:33:19.268 --> 00:33:22.438
I had a second to reflect
after my mom got discharged.

00:33:23.815 --> 00:33:26.150
That's when I finally realized

00:33:27.151 --> 00:33:30.196
that I did something unforgivable.

00:33:31.656 --> 00:33:35.201
I'm deceiving those who trust me.

00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:37.870
I'm sorry.

00:33:37.954 --> 00:33:39.622
I'm really sorry.

00:33:40.206 --> 00:33:43.167
Stop that. It's fine. It's totally fine.

00:33:43.751 --> 00:33:45.044
Sit down.

00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:49.340
You should've told us sooner
if you were going through all that.

00:33:49.423 --> 00:33:51.717
It's not like we wouldn't have understood.

00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:54.178
I misunderstood you for no reason.

00:33:54.762 --> 00:33:57.890
See? I told you
Da-rim wouldn't do something like that.

00:33:58.474 --> 00:34:01.102
When the world has you standing
at the edge of a cliff,

00:34:01.727 --> 00:34:04.605
you have to do whatever you can
to survive.

00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:06.190
How could we not understand that?

00:34:06.274 --> 00:34:07.441
That's right.

00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:08.526
If it weren't for you,

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:11.612
we would've been cast aside like leftovers
before getting kicked out.

00:34:12.613 --> 00:34:14.532
So don't cry.

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:16.951
You're all crying.

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:20.121
I'm only crying because you are.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.126
But still, it doesn't change
the fact that I lied to get this job.

00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:28.713
I'm going to leave after this project.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.716
I already handed in my resignation.

00:34:33.718 --> 00:34:35.219
Oh no.

00:34:36.387 --> 00:34:37.263
I want to see

00:34:37.847 --> 00:34:39.307
my Jin-hui,

00:34:40.558 --> 00:34:41.767
Nan-suk,

00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:44.437
and Go-eun

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:48.399
become full-time employees.

00:34:50.026 --> 00:34:53.571
I'll consider this my last chance
to repay your kindness

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:57.074
and do my absolute best.

00:34:57.158 --> 00:34:58.201
So…

00:34:59.577 --> 00:35:02.788
let's do our best
until the very end, okay?

00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:06.209
-Da-rim.
-I can't believe you.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.171
I'm sorry.

00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:19.847
Mr. Gong, we need to talk.

00:35:19.931 --> 00:35:21.891
-About what?
-You'll see when we get there.

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.352
-Where are we going? Hold on.
-A restaurant.

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:27.521
I made a reservation at the most
expensive place near the office.

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:28.522
Let's go.

00:35:28.606 --> 00:35:29.565
-Great.
-Let's go.

00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:30.483
Let go of me.

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:33.486
Wait. Let me go. Let go!

00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:35.780
Please let me go.

00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:37.949
I said let go!

00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:50.461
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:35:53.464 --> 00:35:56.092
I was so shocked

00:35:56.175 --> 00:35:58.344
when I saw you two hugging each other.

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:02.515
I was really torn
about what to do about you two.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.561
Mr. Kang, you're drinking more than usual.

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.522
How could I not?

00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:10.856
Ji-hyeok betrayed me.

00:36:11.482 --> 00:36:13.192
Hey, I didn't betray you.

00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:14.652
I'm so disappointed in you.

00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:16.821
You should've at least told me.

00:36:16.904 --> 00:36:20.616
So you're saying
you had that banging dynamite kiss

00:36:21.784 --> 00:36:23.119
with Ms. Go, right?

00:36:23.828 --> 00:36:26.455
-"A banging dynamite kiss"?
-"A banging dynamite kiss"?

00:36:30.501 --> 00:36:31.627
Mr. Kang.

00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:32.920
Are you drunk?

00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:34.505
Hold on a second.

00:36:34.588 --> 00:36:37.508
Didn't you tell us you two met
for the first time in Jeju?

00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.177
And you shared an explosive,
dynamite kiss from the start?

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.388
Can you elaborate?

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:43.973
What exactly is a dynamite kiss?

00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:45.558
How is it different from a regular kiss?

00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:47.518
No, that's not…

00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:49.312
-Well…
-Yes?

00:36:54.984 --> 00:36:57.111
You explain it. I can't.

00:36:58.529 --> 00:36:59.989
-So you see…
-Oh my goodness.

00:37:00.072 --> 00:37:01.782
-It's like…
-Yeah?

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:07.705
I don't know what to say.

00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:10.291
She can't say. She doesn't know.

00:37:10.374 --> 00:37:12.710
Seriously? You two are so annoying.

00:37:12.793 --> 00:37:14.503
I don't care
if it's an office affair or romance.

00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:16.130
Let's just get rid of both of them.

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:17.590
I feel so empty inside, Nan-suk.

00:37:17.673 --> 00:37:19.300
Eat as much as you want tonight.

00:37:19.383 --> 00:37:20.426
It's on me.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:22.303
Can we get more meat here?

00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:23.846
A large, please!

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:26.766
Let's go hard tonight!

00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:27.933
Congratulations.

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:30.227
Here's to your relationship.

00:37:30.311 --> 00:37:31.729
-How nice.
-Is it good?

00:37:34.023 --> 00:37:34.857
That must've been

00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:37.234
really tough for you to do.

00:37:39.695 --> 00:37:42.573
It was really brave of you to tell them.

00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:44.325
I mean it.

00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:46.369
I was really worried,

00:37:47.495 --> 00:37:49.121
but they were all so understanding.

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:52.333
I feel bad about it…

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.922
and thankful at the same time.

00:38:11.852 --> 00:38:13.020
Stop crying.

00:38:14.313 --> 00:38:15.398
Okay?

00:38:26.242 --> 00:38:27.493
It's okay.

00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:29.245
I'm proud of you.

00:39:33.434 --> 00:39:34.477
It's hot.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.187
Be careful.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.438
Thank you.

00:40:04.256 --> 00:40:07.009
I should apologize to you as well.

00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:09.929
Why?

00:40:10.596 --> 00:40:13.098
For everything from when we met

00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:15.684
until now.

00:40:16.685 --> 00:40:18.938
You went through a lot emotionally

00:40:19.647 --> 00:40:21.023
and suffered because of me.

00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:24.318
That's true.

00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:26.237
You're right about that.

00:40:27.613 --> 00:40:29.156
It makes me very angry.

00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:31.325
It does,

00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:33.410
but all of it

00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:36.997
is forgivable by the fact that…

00:40:40.626 --> 00:40:41.669
you're single.

00:40:49.635 --> 00:40:51.887
I think you're a really lucky person.

00:40:57.643 --> 00:40:58.477
Thank you.

00:41:09.113 --> 00:41:10.239
What's wrong with me?

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:23.252
Stop running away now.

00:41:25.504 --> 00:41:26.714
I won't ever let you go.

00:43:42.808 --> 00:43:44.226
So handsome.

00:43:49.523 --> 00:43:50.357
I know.

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.985
What?

00:43:53.944 --> 00:43:55.946
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

00:43:58.866 --> 00:43:59.742
Because I'm happy.

00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:14.715
Are we not going to get up?

00:44:15.632 --> 00:44:16.967
We need to eat breakfast.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.511
No thanks.

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:22.389
We need to wash our faces
and brush our teeth.

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:24.183
I don't want to.

00:44:27.978 --> 00:44:30.481
Okay then. Let's just not do it.

00:44:35.277 --> 00:44:37.237
You want to spend the whole day in bed?

00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:38.489
Yeah.

00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:41.033
And do what?

00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:45.037
You know, just this and that.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.371
This and that?

00:44:47.164 --> 00:44:48.290
Yeah.

00:44:50.459 --> 00:44:51.502
This and that…

00:44:52.836 --> 00:44:53.921
Yeah.

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:54.922
Okay.

00:44:57.132 --> 00:44:58.717
Hold on. Wait.

00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:05.933
I guess Da-rim is sleeping in
because it's the weekend.

00:45:06.016 --> 00:45:07.184
No.

00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:08.268
She didn't come home last night.

00:45:08.894 --> 00:45:11.146
She was drinking with a friend.

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:14.024
Maybe…

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:16.985
she has a boyfriend.

00:45:17.986 --> 00:45:19.279
I wish.

00:45:19.363 --> 00:45:21.782
She needs to start dating,

00:45:21.865 --> 00:45:23.242
but she's not interested

00:45:23.325 --> 00:45:25.369
because she's so ambitious
about her career.

00:45:25.994 --> 00:45:29.623
Ji-hyeok is also so dedicated to his work.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.793
It's always work and home for him.

00:45:33.418 --> 00:45:35.379
I don't think
he's ever held a woman's hand before.

00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:38.298
It's concerning, to say the least.

00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:40.759
They say kids nowadays just don't date.

00:45:43.053 --> 00:45:44.638
We should all be concerned.

00:45:44.721 --> 00:45:46.139
By the way,

00:45:47.724 --> 00:45:50.852
what kind of man does Da-rim like?

00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:55.816
I wonder what she'd think of
someone like Ji-hyeok.

00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:57.568
No, that can't happen.

00:45:57.651 --> 00:45:59.403
Why not?

00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:00.821
He's too handsome.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.657
He's not handsome at all.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.659
He's so average-looking.

00:46:05.742 --> 00:46:07.786
Just walk through any street
and look around.

00:46:07.869 --> 00:46:10.330
All guys look like him.

00:46:11.498 --> 00:46:13.625
-Can you tell me where that street is?
-What?

00:46:13.709 --> 00:46:14.668
I want to go and see.

00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:18.297
Anyhow, it won't work.
They come from different worlds.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.424
It's best to marry someone
with a similar background.

00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:22.801
Eat up. The soup's getting cold.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.970
This is delicious.

00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:27.347
Sure.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.440
She sure can drink like a fish.

00:46:37.357 --> 00:46:38.692
I guess she gets that from me too.

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:41.612
Wake up. We're shopping
for your newlywed home today.

00:46:41.695 --> 00:46:43.780
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

00:46:43.864 --> 00:46:44.781
You go.

00:46:44.865 --> 00:46:46.825
Why would I go alone?

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:53.498
-The sea sings
-The sea sings

00:46:53.999 --> 00:46:54.916
What's this?

00:46:57.085 --> 00:46:58.128
So tell me.

00:46:58.795 --> 00:47:01.214
Why were you at Mr. Kim's kid's

00:47:01.757 --> 00:47:02.883
talent show?

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.802
Why did you go and sing?

00:47:05.886 --> 00:47:08.388
Why else? I like him. That's why.

00:47:08.472 --> 00:47:09.806
I told you I liked someone.

00:47:12.684 --> 00:47:14.436
You crazy brat!

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:16.396
How could you be so immature?

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.732
Why him, out of all people?

00:47:18.815 --> 00:47:21.943
-Have you lost your mind?
-What's wrong with him?

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:24.738
Pull yourself together!

00:47:25.238 --> 00:47:28.116
Do you think marrying someone like Dad
is being mature?

00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:30.035
Then I'm just going to be immature.

00:47:30.118 --> 00:47:31.745
I refuse to live like you!

00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:47.260
JUN BABY STUDIO

00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:50.389
He's just some nameless photographer
and a single dad.

00:47:50.472 --> 00:47:52.516
How dare he covet my daughter?

00:47:54.476 --> 00:47:56.478
I let him hold an exhibition
in my art hall,

00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:57.771
and this is how he repays me?

00:47:57.854 --> 00:47:58.772
That ungrateful…

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:03.443
Damn it.

00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:06.238
I'll get straight to the point.

00:48:06.321 --> 00:48:07.447
Ha-yeong…

00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:11.159
Are you okay?

00:48:14.454 --> 00:48:15.789
That damn brat.

00:48:17.708 --> 00:48:19.292
-Mr. Kim Seon-u.
-Just a second.

00:48:26.758 --> 00:48:28.885
Can I see your wrist for a moment?

00:48:29.428 --> 00:48:30.345
Excuse me.

00:48:34.182 --> 00:48:35.183
Let's see.

00:48:37.436 --> 00:48:38.437
It's a little cold.

00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:42.524
Oh, you don't have to.

00:48:43.108 --> 00:48:45.819
I also hurt my wrists a lot
because I spend all day

00:48:45.902 --> 00:48:47.154
playing with children.

00:48:47.904 --> 00:48:49.364
These pain relief patches are the best.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:51.700
I'll put on one more.

00:48:58.081 --> 00:49:00.459
It doesn't hurt, does it?

00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:19.603
It should heal in no time.

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:33.867
Didn't you have something to say?

00:49:35.827 --> 00:49:36.787
And this?

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.456
I didn't know what to get you.

00:49:40.332 --> 00:49:42.626
I couldn't show up empty-handed, could I?

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:44.795
Thank you for this.

00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:49.633
Grapefruits.

00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.845
-Good.
-Okay, we'll get this.

00:49:58.016 --> 00:49:59.935
What's your favorite pasta?

00:50:00.018 --> 00:50:00.977
I'll make whatever you want.

00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:04.356
You know how to cook pasta, Mr. Gong?

00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:06.399
Of course, I do.

00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.028
Wait.

00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:12.239
We're on a date.
Can you stop calling me Mr. Gong?

00:50:13.615 --> 00:50:15.200
Sorry, Mr. Gong.

00:50:17.035 --> 00:50:18.787
Then what should I call you?

00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:21.373
Ji-hyeok.

00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:24.835
That's fine too, but…

00:50:26.336 --> 00:50:27.170
Ba…

00:50:28.255 --> 00:50:30.215
Baby? Like "baby boy"?

00:50:30.298 --> 00:50:31.716
No, not that.

00:50:32.342 --> 00:50:33.176
Babe.

00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:35.720
Whatever, just forget it.

00:50:36.513 --> 00:50:37.848
Babe, let's go!

00:50:51.027 --> 00:50:52.279
Let's go, babe!

00:50:53.738 --> 00:50:54.948
Come on, babe!

00:51:49.794 --> 00:51:50.795
Ta-da!

00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:52.422
This looks amazing!

00:51:52.505 --> 00:51:53.340
Me?

00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:32.379
Two.

00:52:41.972 --> 00:52:42.931
Hold on.

00:52:43.014 --> 00:52:44.265
You have something here.

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:46.851
No, not there.

00:53:34.065 --> 00:53:36.401
Do you think marrying someone like Dad
is being mature?

00:53:36.484 --> 00:53:37.444
Then I'm just going to be immature.

00:53:37.527 --> 00:53:38.903
I refuse to live like you!

00:53:42.407 --> 00:53:43.241
Water.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:44.784
What?

00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:47.495
What are you doing? Pour me some water.

00:53:55.462 --> 00:53:56.671
Are you serious?

00:53:57.172 --> 00:53:59.007
You can't even pour a cup of water?

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:00.717
I hurt my wrist.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.676
You have another one!

00:54:02.886 --> 00:54:03.762
That's true.

00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:05.555
I forgot I had two arms.

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:10.226
Goddamn it.

00:54:12.604 --> 00:54:15.065
This is the shortlist of products
we're looking to update.

00:54:15.148 --> 00:54:17.567
Is the development team
working on any of them already?

00:54:18.234 --> 00:54:19.944
We have nothing planned for them.

00:54:20.653 --> 00:54:22.697
But the fact that we don't

00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:25.533
means that those products already have
high customer satisfaction ratings.

00:54:26.242 --> 00:54:30.622
An unnecessary update
could end up backfiring.

00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:32.582
That's right. I know it's a challenge,

00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:34.250
but I suggest you try
to come up with something

00:54:34.334 --> 00:54:36.127
that's not already in our product line.

00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:39.923
Then you'd also be pioneering
a new market for us.

00:54:41.132 --> 00:54:42.759
That's true.

00:54:42.842 --> 00:54:43.968
If I could offer a tip,

00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:46.012
I'd say start recording everything
on your phone.

00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:47.222
Record everything?

00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:49.641
You don't know when an idea will strike.

00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:52.602
Recording it the second you think of it
will be helpful.

00:54:52.685 --> 00:54:54.479
Trial and error will be inevitable,

00:54:54.562 --> 00:54:55.897
so if you record every step,

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.982
you'll be able to review
where it went wrong.

00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:00.235
Oh, that makes sense.

00:55:00.318 --> 00:55:01.486
Thank you.

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:02.737
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:55:13.123 --> 00:55:13.957
It looks uncomfortable.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.874
So I think…

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.753
So I think it needs to be updated.

00:55:21.548 --> 00:55:22.757
That's a must.

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:42.485
The size…

00:55:43.736 --> 00:55:45.697
-I think diaper bags might be good.
-Diaper bags…

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.739
Look at this fabric.

00:55:46.823 --> 00:55:47.699
Diapers?

00:55:47.782 --> 00:55:48.825
That would be…

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:50.618
-Take a look at this one.
-This one too.

00:55:50.702 --> 00:55:52.036
This one too.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:53.496
This one's…

00:56:30.909 --> 00:56:32.952
I'm not sure how it should be tied.

00:56:33.036 --> 00:56:33.870
The way you tie it?

00:56:51.471 --> 00:56:52.805
Let me do it.

00:56:52.889 --> 00:56:54.474
This one? Or this one?

00:56:55.058 --> 00:56:56.851
I think that one.

00:57:02.941 --> 00:57:04.609
KNOT IS COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO USE
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR BABY

00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:06.194
NO POCKETS OR NOT ENOUGH FOR WIPES
HIP SEAT ADDS WEIGHT AND CAUSES STRAIN

00:57:06.277 --> 00:57:07.528
THE WAY IT'S TIED
DETERMINES DIFFICULTY OF USE

00:57:22.293 --> 00:57:24.212
Look. Next.

00:57:24.712 --> 00:57:26.256
-Ta-da!
-That color is so nice.

00:57:26.339 --> 00:57:27.465
-Yeah.
-It is.

00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:28.841
This is nice.

00:57:28.925 --> 00:57:30.301
-It's so pretty.
-It's good for a tone-on-tone look.

00:57:30.385 --> 00:57:33.137
But I still think
the fabric is most important.

00:57:42.647 --> 00:57:44.107
This isn't right.

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:45.608
How can I…

00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:49.153
What's that?

00:57:55.326 --> 00:57:56.286
Mr. Gong!

00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.204
Seriously.

00:57:58.788 --> 00:57:59.914
WITH BABY

00:58:01.416 --> 00:58:03.334
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

00:58:03.418 --> 00:58:04.627
Okay!

00:58:06.838 --> 00:58:09.465
-This is excellent!
-We did it!

00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:11.134
-We did it!
-Baby carrier.

00:58:11.718 --> 00:58:14.596
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:16.598
-We did it.
-Baby carrier.

00:58:16.681 --> 00:58:17.807
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:20.643
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

00:58:20.727 --> 00:58:22.061
Baby carrier.

00:58:23.313 --> 00:58:25.440
To account for sweating in the summer,

00:58:25.523 --> 00:58:27.609
we can use some sort of mesh fabric.

00:58:28.484 --> 00:58:30.778
How about making it with mesh fabric

00:58:30.862 --> 00:58:32.155
and detachable?

00:58:32.238 --> 00:58:34.365
Two options for summer and winter.

00:58:34.449 --> 00:58:36.409
You haven't texted me all day.

00:58:37.368 --> 00:58:39.037
Here you are
just recording yourself again.

00:58:40.538 --> 00:58:42.248
Are you going home, Mr. Gong?

00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:45.585
No one's around.

00:58:54.135 --> 00:58:56.679
Are you leaving already, babe?

00:58:56.763 --> 00:58:59.932
I'll miss you so much through the night.

00:59:04.812 --> 00:59:06.522
We can go home together.

00:59:07.482 --> 00:59:08.399
To my place.

00:59:12.862 --> 00:59:13.696
I can wait for you.

00:59:14.656 --> 00:59:16.658
I really want to go with you,

00:59:16.741 --> 00:59:18.368
but I still have a lot of work to do.

00:59:19.077 --> 00:59:20.662
The prototype is coming out soon,

00:59:20.745 --> 00:59:22.955
and we need to make final edits if needed.

00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:24.457
You should go home.

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.625
I can't concentrate.

00:59:26.918 --> 00:59:27.877
Hold on.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.962
I left files in the meeting room.

00:59:30.672 --> 00:59:31.798
Go first, okay?

00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:33.007
See you tomorrow!

00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:53.486
I'm going home first.

00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:57.699
I'm really leaving.

01:00:01.244 --> 01:00:03.955
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

01:00:06.207 --> 01:00:07.458
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:11.212
I just want to

01:00:12.213 --> 01:00:13.715
chat and laugh with you every day.

01:00:18.177 --> 01:00:20.054
It's finally here.

01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:22.974
-Hurry up and open it!
-I can't look at it.

01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:25.017
-I'll open it for you.
-I can't.

01:00:25.852 --> 01:00:27.228
-Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.
-It's so pretty.

01:00:27.311 --> 01:00:29.772
-My goodness. I can't believe this.
-It looks so luxurious.

01:00:29.856 --> 01:00:30.940
Oh my.

01:00:31.023 --> 01:00:32.942
It's finally here.

01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:36.195
Natural BeBe's first baby carrier.

01:00:37.405 --> 01:00:40.116
That's right,
it's the baby carrier we created.

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.161
This is exactly how I felt
when I gave birth to my first son.

01:00:43.244 --> 01:00:44.078
My goodness.

01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:46.914
You know the feeling, right?

01:00:46.998 --> 01:00:49.792
This will be out on the market
next week, right?

01:00:49.876 --> 01:00:50.918
I'm not dreaming, am I?

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:54.338
Now, now.

01:00:54.422 --> 01:00:56.340
You all worked really hard.

01:00:56.424 --> 01:00:58.509
I'm sure we'll see positive results.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:00.470
Mr. Gong!

01:01:01.387 --> 01:01:03.514
Mr. Gong! You all need to look at this.

01:01:04.474 --> 01:01:05.808
This came out so nicely.

01:01:05.892 --> 01:01:06.768
Look at it.

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:12.774
This is the same as our prototype.

01:01:12.857 --> 01:01:15.234
We never placed an order for this color.

01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:18.863
This is a new product
that MomsJoy released this morning.

01:01:19.614 --> 01:01:20.448
What?

01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:24.243
That can't be. Why would our product
be released by another company?

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:26.120
Yeah, there must be some sort of mistake.

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.664
-Mr. Kang, you must be mistaken.
-No.

01:01:28.748 --> 01:01:30.708
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:33.628
"MomsJoy is releasing a new baby carrier."

01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:35.129
"It utilizes a body-hugging design

01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:37.215
that notably reduces shoulder
and lower-back strain."

01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:40.092
"It's made with cutting-edge materials
to make it lighter than a towel…"

01:01:41.052 --> 01:01:43.596
It's the exact same materials
and features.

01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:45.765
-That can't be.
-Are you being serious?

01:01:45.848 --> 01:01:47.850
-Let me see.
-Are you serious?

01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:50.144
They're so similar.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:55.274
Who's Go Da-rim?

01:01:59.612 --> 01:02:00.696
Chairman Gong.

01:02:02.156 --> 01:02:03.866
I'm Go Da-rim.

01:02:06.035 --> 01:02:07.370
You're Go Da-rim?

01:02:09.914 --> 01:02:10.832
Oh my!

01:02:45.366 --> 01:02:50.288
DYNAMITE KISS

01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.570
So you knew she lied to get hired
and let it slide?

01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:23.654
Yes.

01:03:23.738 --> 01:03:26.532
But framing her for being a spy
when she didn't do anything?

01:03:26.616 --> 01:03:27.533
That's enough.

01:03:27.617 --> 01:03:30.661
He knew I lied and still covered for me,

01:03:30.745 --> 01:03:32.371
and now he's in a tight spot.

01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:33.414
You're just going to give up

01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:35.958
on being promoted to vice president
and our joint venture with Taeyu C&T?

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:37.919
All because of a woman like her?

01:03:38.002 --> 01:03:39.587
Think wisely!

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:43.883
I was the one who leaked the new product
to a competitor.

01:03:43.966 --> 01:03:45.843
Why do you insist on suffering alone?

01:03:45.927 --> 01:03:49.221
-Just trust me and--
-I'm suffering because of you.

01:03:49.305 --> 01:03:51.974
Let's break up.

01:03:52.058 --> 01:03:53.893
Let's each go back to where we belong.

01:03:53.976 --> 01:03:56.395
This is me at rock bottom.

01:03:56.896 --> 01:04:01.859
