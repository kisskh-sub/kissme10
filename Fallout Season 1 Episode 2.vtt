Listen, I don't know who you are

56:33.916 --> 56:36.958
or how you know the things that you do,

56:36.958 --> 56:40.416
but you are going to get across
that wasteland.

56:40.416 --> 56:42.500
And we're gonna do it together.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.333
Okay?

56:44.333 --> 56:46.625
That's a promise.

No, you see,

56:53.375 --> 56:55.416
Vault-Tec Plan D.

56:55.416 --> 56:58.208
It was the most humane product
that Vault-Tec ever made.

56:58.208 --> 57:00.333
It was quick, painless.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.625

57:02.625 --> 57:05.500

57:09.291 --> 57:11.291
People are going to come after you.

57:11.291 --> 57:13.375
You'll need to move quickly.

57:14.750 --> 57:18.583
You can change the future

57:18.583 --> 57:21.875
if you can bring me to Moldaver.

57:23.875 --> 57:25.750
But how am I gonna bring you if you're...

57:25.750 --> 57:28.916
No, not-not my whole body. [groans]

57:31.541 --> 57:32.750
Just my head.

57:33.791 --> 57:35.250
- Here.
- Pardon?

57:46.791 --> 57:48.458
I took the pill

57:48.458 --> 57:51.958
so that it would be less taxing
for you to go through with it.

57:51.958 --> 57:55.000
It'll be easier if you carry my head

57:55.000 --> 57:57.958
instead of dragging my whole body.

You...

Please. I'm begging you.

58:06.791 --> 58:09.791
And this is the only way
to get your dad back.

58:09.791 --> 58:12.833
I knew I could trust you.

58:12.833 --> 58:15.875
You are a vault dweller.

But if you're going to survive up here...
