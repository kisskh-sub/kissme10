WEBVTT

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:09.205
(Love knows no age...)

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.215
(because it is always born anew.)

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.639
(because it is always born anew.)

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.279
During an important period of my life,

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.809
I could have gotten married.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.319
But I chose my career over marriage.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.289
I don't remember ever taking a break.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.559
My career felt more important than love.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.265
Then I wondered,

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.299
"At this rate, am I
going to grow old alone?"

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.599
"If only I had someone by my side."

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.745
(But don't tell me...)

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.039
He's not ten years younger than me, is he?

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.979
Does age matter when
I have feelings for her?

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.209
If someone really piques my interest,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.219
I don't care about the age gap.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.949
It's not easy to find a
younger guy like me.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.219
What could you hate about being young?

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:07.059
Isn't it better?

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.389
What? This is adorable.

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.935
(An older woman and a younger man's...)

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.429
(real romance begins.)

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.299
Noona, how about a date?

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.769
It made my heart flutter a bit.

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:25.185
Should I say he was cute?

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:26.239
He was cute.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.979
That moment itself was really nice.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:33.225
He kept touching me a
little without hesitation.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.389
I noticed it.

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:37.289
To think that a younger
guy could feel like a man.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:39.795
(One by one, )

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.659
(the moments that made
them forget the age gap.)

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.829
It felt like a scene out of a movie.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.469
How old are you comfortable with?

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.139
About four years older?

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.509
"Am I not attractive as a
woman?" was what I thought.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.379
I'm just a child to you.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.865
Laughing in front of
you can't be a lie, right?

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.689
He was much younger than I had imagined.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.189
I couldn't keep a straight face.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.535
"Age doesn't matter that much."

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.989
That was what I thought.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.835
We weren't meant to be.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.699
That was the conclusion I reached.

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.069
(Noona Is A Woman to Me)

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.409
(Everyone is frozen.)

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.339
This is bad.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.585
That just now...

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.649
We only watched for a minute or two, right?

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.749
- Right now, my heart is...
- Yes?

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.949
Beating like crazy.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.865
What did you think?

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.265
(Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.789
I liked how they called me "noon a."

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.659
But for real, I'm serious.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.375
"I really am old now."

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.376
Right.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.375
- That really hit me.
- Why? And when

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.475
I've always been called "noon a..."

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.285
- By my younger brother.
- I see.

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.139
But that kind of noon a wasn't everything.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.525
Being called "noon a"
by a younger brother,

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.079
and him calling me "noon
a" are completely different.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.555
But that guy didn't call you "noon a,"

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.789
so why?

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.249
It makes me happy, okay?

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.789
If you don't mind me asking,

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.135
have you dated a younger guy before?

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.929
- Of course.
- I see.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.229
I may have dated more younger
guys than you can imagine.

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.776
That's right.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.045
After entering my mid-30s,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.915
I've mainly dated younger guys.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.539
Do older guys not like me because I'm old?

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.215
The participants only know that

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.155
the women are older
and the men are younger,

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.955
but they don't know their actual ages.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:44.956
No.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.295
Say that you really like someone,

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.625
but they turn out to be
12 years older or younger.

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.349
Simply put, there's a big age gap.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.889
How would you feel?

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.665
(Sighing)

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.259
How old is 12 years younger?

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.589
He just turned 30.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.729
- Thirty sounds a little tough.
- For example.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.759
- May I ask the reason?
- Well

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.999
I can't help but think he's too young.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.769
Shouldn't he be at least 33 or 34?

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.469
- It's only a three-year difference.
- Here's the thing.

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.485
Guys in their early 30s and
mid-30s are completely different.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.439
There's a huge difference in their insight.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:14.209
What about you?

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:15.809
I'm fine with it.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.525
I'm fine with anyone over 30.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.949
- Anyone over 30?
- Over 30?

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.195
Among our older women
and younger men participants,

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.219
Yes?

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:26.889
The biggest age gap is 12 years.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.765
- For real?
- There are participants

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.789
with that age gap.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.405
Will they...

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:33.969
Isn't it the one messing up her hair?

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.529
This sounds really fun.

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:41.539
(One day in September)

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.149
(Where they meet for the first time)

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.849
(A red car arrives first.)

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.379
She has an innocent style.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.725
(Park Ye Eun)

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:23.179
Her skin is pure white.

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.749
I only worked hard for my future.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.159
During an important period of my life,

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:32.919
I could have gotten married.

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.889
But I chose my career over marriage.

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:38.899
I'm lonely.

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.099
I'm lonely right now.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.579
(She's here to meet her fated partner.)

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:02.549
She looks quite young.

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.965
- I'd say she's in her 20s.
- Totally in her 20s.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.089
- Right?
- Yes.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.629
(Pouting)

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:17.839
(Feeling shy)

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.809
I was extremely nervous.

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:24.739
"Who will show up?"

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.609
It also made me excited.

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.725
(Fate comes at unexpected times, )

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:35.949
(like a sudden shower.)

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:38.289
Is it a guy this time?

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:39.995
(The second participant
appears amidst the shower.)

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:41.265
What a nice car.

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.399
(The second participant
appears amidst the shower.)

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.485
It's a female participant?

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:02.909
(Walking confidently in high heels)

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.365
It's a participant with a different charm.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.059
(Park Ji Won)

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.989
I don't remember ever
taking a break like this.

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:17.675
I've always worked, studied,

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:18.859
and started a business.

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:20.135
You never really

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.245
get the chance to spend time

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:25.045
solely getting to know someone

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.339
in your life.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.209
(As it's a precious opportunity,
she wants to find someone nice.)

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:39.779
Hi.

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:41.619
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:44.459
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:46.889
Did you wait long?

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:48.989
No.

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:53.035
It's hot, isn't it?

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:54.169
Yes, it is.

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.575
One female participant met
another female participant.

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.039
- That must've been weird.
- Totally.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.669
(Glancing)

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:02.869
(Glancing again)

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.339
(Glancing)

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.339
How awkward.

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:12.019
(An awkward air flows between the two.)

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.049
You're pretty.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.089
You're much prettier.

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:19.795
That's normal when ladies meet up,

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:22.029
complimenting each other on their beauty.

00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:24.509
There should be two more participants.

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:26.605
It must be a total of four.

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.869
Right? I'm excited.

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:32.445
- Oh, no.
- She's cute.

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.915
I was wondering why she looked so cheerful.

00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:36.459
She thinks there's little competition.

00:08:36.609 --> 00:08:37.939
She believes it's 2-on-2.

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:45.549
(A sedan arrives third.)

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:50.859
(Is it finally a younger man?)

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:58.859
Seriously?

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:00.869
It's like a commercial.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.569
A commercial.

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:03.629
Gorgeous.

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:13.179
(Kim Yeong Gyeong)

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:16.609
To me, dating is an unknown world.

00:09:16.749 --> 00:09:18.919
- It's a mystery.
- Why?

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:23.049
It's like an area I need to explore.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.959
Right now, dating

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:27.629
is at zero.

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:30.935
I spend about 99 on my work,

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:35.199
and 1 on taking breaks,
doing hobbies, and enjoying life.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:40.969
Honestly, looking back,

00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:45.509
there were more times when
guys passionately pursued me first

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:49.079
rather than me winning their love.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.725
That's why, if I get the chance,

00:09:51.749 --> 00:09:53.949
I'd like to win his heart first.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:57.689
I look forward to what I will do.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.869
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:12.569
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:14.669
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:18.339
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:10:20.739 --> 00:10:22.409
(Staring)

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:29.749
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too. Hi.

00:10:29.849 --> 00:10:31.659
You made a long trip to get here.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.789
- It was quite far.
- Right?

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:36.366
(They look taken aback.)

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.599
They thought it'd be a younger guy.

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:41.005
To think this would happen.

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:42.229
Three women.

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:44.645
What's going on?

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:46.315
Why only women?

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:49.409
What's more, everyone has long
hair and is wearing a white top.

00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:50.509
You're right.

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:55.355
(The fourth woman has arrived.)

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:57.479
The fourth woman. Another woman?

00:10:59.849 --> 00:11:01.049
She's wearing black.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.035
(Gu Bon Hee)

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:10.165
It looks like a commercial
whenever a woman walks in.

00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:12.905
I was the type who used myself

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:14.629
as a tool to work.

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:17.739
My career felt more important than love.

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:24.069
But after realizing there are more
important things than my career,

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:28.349
I thought this would be a chance
to focus only on my feelings.

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:31.625
So I'm looking forward to
it. It's giving me butterflies.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.349
(Will she find someone who
will make her heart pound again?)

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:38.265
What they say is different
from other dating shows.

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:39.619
- How so?
- Exactly.

00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:44.005
They can summarize the kind of life

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:45.529
they've lived in one sentence.

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:47.805
The fact that they can explain

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:50.675
in one sentence why they haven't

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:53.515
gotten married or dated until now

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:57.085
shows how straightforward their lives are.

00:11:57.109 --> 00:11:58.415
They have a clear answer.

00:11:58.439 --> 00:12:00.209
- They seem confident.
- For sure.

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:04.109
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:06.695
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:07.949
Hi.

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:11.319
I didn't know everyone had arrived.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.365
(Everyone's eyes are fixed
on Bon Hee upon her arrival.)

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:16.429
They're studying her.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:18.129
The older women study her.

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:20.929
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:22.999
(Nervous)

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:26.775
(The 4 older women have gathered first.)

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:27.809
How awkward.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.039
(Glancing)

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:38.255
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.795
Everyone here is so gorgeous

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:42.219
that my eyes

00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:44.665
are feasting.

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:45.989
I'm...

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.389
(Reading the room)

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:54.529
I'll stay still because it'd be
awkward if I said something back.

00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:55.969
You get it, right?

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:59.499
Like when women say,
"You've lost weight," and all.

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:01.269
So I won't say anything.

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:05.215
But it's not that easy
to tell another woman

00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:07.585
that your eyes are feasting
because she's pretty.

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:08.885
- No.
- Exactly.

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:11.229
- People keep it to themselves.
- It shows how nice she is.

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:15.289
It's a story about older
women and younger men.

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:18.489
How did you feel after hearing it?

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.159
- It felt new.
- Right.

00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:23.429
But I thought it'd be fun too.

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:26.305
Have you dated a younger guy before?

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:28.799
Once, when I was in my 20s.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.069
I rarely had the chance

00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:35.139
to meet older men.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.849
It's fun, and they have the energy

00:13:43.209 --> 00:13:44.919
that suits me better.

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:48.349
In general, it feels like
younger men hit on women

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.265
more passionately.

00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:51.659
(Agreeing)

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:53.295
(Nodding)

00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:54.489
Everyone can relate.

00:13:54.789 --> 00:13:56.205
Aren't I right?

00:13:56.229 --> 00:13:57.205
(Becoming self-conscious)

00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:58.206
(Thinking)

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.329
I hit on guys first.

00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:04.599
Maybe they hit on you first
because you're beautiful.

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:06.469
(Embarrassed)

00:14:06.499 --> 00:14:09.015
The one time I dated a younger
guy, I remember hitting on him first.

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:10.115
(Sharing memories of dating younger men)

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:11.979
But I didn't know his age at first.

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:14.755
I didn't. I only found out

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:16.549
he was younger as we talked.

00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:19.919
Teto-guy versus egen-guy.

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:23.089
But the two are...

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:24.819
- Must I choose one?
- Yes.

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:26.995
Only one.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:28.005
(Bummed out)

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:30.529
I like crunchy outside, tender inside.

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:34.205
So a teto-guy on the outside,
an egen-guy on the inside.

00:14:34.229 --> 00:14:35.575
Aren't they the most popular these days?

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:36.929
- Yes.
- Right?

00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:38.839
I'll go with her answer too.

00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:41.209
You too?

00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:42.909
A puppy-like guy.

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:45.585
In short, an egen-guy.

00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:46.709
- Yes.
- Right.

00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:50.209
They got a message.

00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:51.749
Our phone went off.

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:55.349
- "Check the top of the cabinet."
- "Check the top of the cabinet."

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:00.435
"Here are keywords that
are hints about the men."

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:03.759
"Choose one card that you like."

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:07.375
- What?
- It's for you.

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:09.399
(The fateful keyword Yeong
Gyeong should choose?)

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:11.345
Crunchy outside, tender inside.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.945
(Crunchy outside,
tender inside is included.)

00:15:12.969 --> 00:15:14.915
- Perfect.
- How is this possible?

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:16.345
There's even Golden Retriever.

00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:18.009
(Golden Retriever, similar to puppy-like)

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.485
"Let's go get meat,
noon a. Well-organized."

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:22.425
(Captivating younger men's keywords)

00:15:22.449 --> 00:15:23.825
"If you're with me,"
- "If you're with me,"

00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:25.395
- "your ears will never be bored."
- "your ears will never be bored."

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:27.095
- "The day flies by."
- "The day flies by."

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:29.819
Woo Young and SOOBIN. Say that
you were to come up with keywords.

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:30.966
What would yours be?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.719
- To introduce myself?
- Yes.

00:15:32.859 --> 00:15:34.265
I want to see the person I'm interested in

00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:35.829
continue to laugh.

00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:39.799
"Be with me, and you'll
laugh your head off."

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:41.945
I'm interested.

00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:42.946
- Nice.
- You are?

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.715
No? Don't you think he'll be funny?

00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:45.799
What's your hashtag?

00:15:46.499 --> 00:15:47.769
Have you in stitches.

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:51.815
- It suddenly...
- What is it? Was that a good one?

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.079
I'm no longer interested.

00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:54.609
"Have you in stitches" was a bit...

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:56.809
Did it drop your expectations?
What about you, SOOBIN?

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:57.995
My hashtag would be...

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.925
(SOOBIN's keyword to
top "have you in stitches")

00:15:59.949 --> 00:16:02.189
- A chameleon.
- A chameleon?

00:16:02.549 --> 00:16:03.795
- Is it too old-fashioned?
- A chameleon?

00:16:03.819 --> 00:16:05.589
(Embarrassed)

00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:07.209
- A chameleon?
- I can become anything.

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:11.275
I like to adapt to my partner rather
than expecting them to adapt to me.

00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:12.629
- Really?
- Yes.

00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:14.405
(At that moment)

00:16:14.429 --> 00:16:15.669
Here they are.

00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:19.369
(Are the younger men finally revealed?)

00:16:19.599 --> 00:16:21.969
(In different locations, )

00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:23.985
What's going on?

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:24.986
(the 4 younger men...)

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.055
What a nice silhouette.

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.056
(are waiting.)

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.279
He's got a nice silhouette.

00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:34.749
(After choosing the keywords they like, )

00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:36.625
(the older women head off to pick them up.)

00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:37.649
They go to pick them up?

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:40.565
The older women are going to pick

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:42.029
- the younger men up.
- Pick them up.

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:47.899
(The first younger man is
waiting for the older woman.)

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:51.669
I find older women more comfortable.

00:16:52.969 --> 00:16:55.769
Older women are more
comfortable than younger women.

00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:59.539
If she's my ideal type,

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:03.049
I could date someone
ten years older than me.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.495
(Who will come to this man, )

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.289
(looking for his ideal type?)

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:12.819
I was extremely nervous.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.489
I wondered what would happen.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:19.499
I was worried,

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.105
but I'm also curious.

00:17:21.129 --> 00:17:22.829
(I'm curious about who I will meet.)

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:26.039
(Tense)

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:29.069
(Glancing)

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:34.209
(She eases her tension with a hand grip.)

00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:35.355
A hand grip?

00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:36.925
I've never seen anyone
relieve tension with a hand grip.

00:17:36.949 --> 00:17:38.349
She uses a hand grip?

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:44.249
(Clicking)

00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:48.905
(She trains her grip strength...)

00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:53.499
(and arrives at the place
where a younger guy awaits.)

00:17:55.499 --> 00:17:59.175
(The tense yet thrilling moment...)

00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:03.639
(of a first encounter)

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.879
(Who's the woman that
picked the first younger guy?)

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:16.695
(Bon Hee's pick)

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:19.565
He's the guy that Bon Hee picked, right?

00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:20.566
Yes.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.459
(Hesitating)

00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.400
(Bon Hee's pick)

00:18:25.424 --> 00:18:28.170
He's the guy that Bon Hee picked, right?

00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:29.171
Yes.

00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.194
(Hesitating)

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:34.364
Hello.

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:36.664
Hello.

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:41.074
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:18:41.974 --> 00:18:43.174
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:45.044
- I'll take a seat.
- Sure.

00:18:46.574 --> 00:18:47.950
That's Mu Jin.

00:18:47.974 --> 00:18:49.474
(Bon Hee picked Mu Jin.)

00:18:50.544 --> 00:18:51.844
Have you waited long?

00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:55.784
A couple of hours.

00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:58.030
- You waited long.
- Yes.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.224
Didn't you have to wait?

00:19:00.294 --> 00:19:01.394
Not really.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:09.710
- He's good-looking.
- He's nice.

00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:10.711
They look cute together.

00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:12.040
- He's handsome.
- They make a cute couple.

00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:13.134
They do.

00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:14.610
- They do.
- They're a good match.

00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:16.080
They don't really look like a couple

00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:17.420
with an age gap.

00:19:17.444 --> 00:19:18.780
- Right?
- Not at all.

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:21.020
Did you see the guy trying to hold

00:19:21.044 --> 00:19:22.414
his smile?

00:19:23.514 --> 00:19:25.020
I think the woman is into him too.

00:19:25.044 --> 00:19:26.854
- She also looks satisfied.
- Yes.

00:19:28.354 --> 00:19:32.924
(A pleasant tension)

00:19:33.754 --> 00:19:35.300
I noticed that you almost
finished your coffee,

00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:36.900
so I thought you had been here for a while.

00:19:36.924 --> 00:19:38.394
- Would you like one?
- Sorry?

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.994
Should I have one too?

00:19:40.594 --> 00:19:42.194
Then, we'll.

00:19:42.734 --> 00:19:44.264
- I'll pay for it.
- Hold on.

00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:49.904
(Mu Jin hurriedly grabbed his card.)

00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:53.914
What would you like?

00:19:54.414 --> 00:19:56.050
I'll have an iced latte.

00:19:56.074 --> 00:19:57.414
- An iced latte?
- Yes.

00:19:58.084 --> 00:19:59.514
- This one?
- Yes.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.684
I'll have another cup of coffee.

00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:05.124
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:20:05.484 --> 00:20:07.330
Do you sleep well even after having coffee?

00:20:07.354 --> 00:20:08.394
Yes.

00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:11.624
(Yes.)

00:20:11.964 --> 00:20:14.194
- What?
- What?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.794
He subtly dropped the honorifics.

00:20:16.904 --> 00:20:19.104
This show is wild.

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:21.974
(This older woman is thrilled.)

00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:23.420
But they've just met.

00:20:23.444 --> 00:20:24.720
(Speechless)

00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:25.950
Before

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.574
they went to order coffee, Bon Hee asked,

00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:31.820
"Do you sleep well, even after coffee?"

00:20:31.844 --> 00:20:33.190
- She did.
- Yes.

00:20:33.214 --> 00:20:37.124
I felt a difference from that one sentence.

00:20:38.024 --> 00:20:39.730
Right? She was being considerate.

00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:42.330
I felt cared for.

00:20:42.354 --> 00:20:44.394
- Right.
- That's how it felt.

00:20:45.694 --> 00:20:47.414
Do you sleep well even after having coffee?

00:20:47.534 --> 00:20:48.564
Yes.

00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:51.704
(Grinning)

00:20:52.964 --> 00:20:54.274
Thank you for the coffee.

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:02.020
(Spotting the keyword)

00:21:02.044 --> 00:21:04.114
Did you pick this card?

00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:05.284
I did.

00:21:06.084 --> 00:21:07.684
(Twitching his nose)

00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:11.860
- The profiles were...
- Yes.

00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:13.354
All different.

00:21:13.454 --> 00:21:15.570
- That looks like my profile.
- Yes.

00:21:15.594 --> 00:21:17.640
- Can you turn to the side?
- Me?

00:21:17.664 --> 00:21:19.200
Is it this side? I think it's the other side.

00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:20.910
- Is it this side?
- There it is.

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:22.734
I said that the back of
your head was pretty.

00:21:24.504 --> 00:21:25.610
When I saw this,

00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:28.504
I said that the back of
your head was very round.

00:21:31.774 --> 00:21:34.574
But you look way better in person.

00:21:34.714 --> 00:21:35.874
- Do I?
- Yes.

00:21:36.544 --> 00:21:39.344
In the shadow, you're more...

00:21:40.154 --> 00:21:41.860
The back of my head really is round.

00:21:41.884 --> 00:21:44.000
- I also have a round head.
- I see.

00:21:44.024 --> 00:21:45.084
Can I see?

00:21:45.154 --> 00:21:47.094
- I have a round head.
- You do.

00:21:48.424 --> 00:21:50.470
(Staring)

00:21:50.494 --> 00:21:51.870
You're really beautiful.

00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:53.794
Me? Thank you.

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:57.464
(Goodness gracious)

00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.480
(Amazed)

00:21:59.504 --> 00:22:01.304
- Wait!
- "You're beautiful."

00:22:01.634 --> 00:22:02.734
What was that?

00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:05.604
- Who is this guy?
- They do that?

00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:07.344
I loved the non-honorifics, though.

00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:09.250
You can make a clip of that,

00:22:09.274 --> 00:22:11.484
and give it to Seul Hye.

00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:12.720
Make a clip of him
saying, "You're beautiful,"

00:22:12.744 --> 00:22:14.360
and send it to me.

00:22:14.384 --> 00:22:16.704
I'm cool with just an audio
file if you can't get a video.

00:22:16.954 --> 00:22:18.630
SOOBIN, - Yes.

00:22:18.654 --> 00:22:20.454
Would you be able

00:22:20.954 --> 00:22:24.424
to say that while sipping a drink?

00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:26.440
I'm not good at saying things I don't mean,

00:22:26.464 --> 00:22:28.770
- so if it's not true...
- But she's actually pretty.

00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:31.610
If she's as pretty as Bon Hee,

00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:33.650
I wouldn't have a problem saying that.

00:22:33.674 --> 00:22:34.810
- Really?
- Yes.

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:37.474
It's also a good way
to start a conversation.

00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:39.880
Mu Jin is skilled.

00:22:39.904 --> 00:22:42.014
- He's no ordinary man.
- Definitely.

00:22:43.344 --> 00:22:44.420
You're really beautiful.

00:22:44.444 --> 00:22:46.614
Me? Thank you.

00:22:47.214 --> 00:22:48.654
You're handsome.

00:22:50.984 --> 00:22:52.360
(Twitching his nose)

00:22:52.384 --> 00:22:55.070
The way he twitches
his nose is very charming.

00:22:55.094 --> 00:22:56.624
- I'm nervous.
- Are you nervous?

00:23:04.934 --> 00:23:07.104
I'll tell you why I picked it.

00:23:08.574 --> 00:23:09.774
Because you like meat?

00:23:10.244 --> 00:23:12.104
I must have wanted meat.

00:23:12.874 --> 00:23:16.474
And this keyword
"well-organized" made me think

00:23:17.044 --> 00:23:18.320
you'd be

00:23:18.344 --> 00:23:21.754
capable and responsible.

00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:24.000
- Right.
- Am I right?

00:23:24.024 --> 00:23:26.124
My name is Kim Mu Jin.

00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:29.494
- It's Kim Mu Jin?
- Yes, Kim Mu Jin.

00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.564
- And I'm well-organized, so...
- Really?

00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:34.664
- Is that why you chose that word?
- Yes.

00:23:35.194 --> 00:23:36.764
- It's my nickname.
- Your nickname?

00:23:37.664 --> 00:23:39.080
What's your name, if you mind me asking?

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:41.774
I'm Gu Bon Hee.

00:23:41.974 --> 00:23:44.004
- Gu Bon Hee?
- Bon Hee.

00:23:45.274 --> 00:23:46.344
That's right.

00:23:47.974 --> 00:23:48.974
Yes.

00:23:51.184 --> 00:23:53.314
- What kind of meat do you like?
- Meat?

00:23:54.154 --> 00:23:55.484
Pork belly with kimchi.

00:23:55.714 --> 00:23:57.224
- Pork belly with kimchi?
- Yes.

00:23:58.684 --> 00:24:00.564
We'll get to have meat
together one day, right?

00:24:01.054 --> 00:24:02.194
I'd like that.

00:24:09.164 --> 00:24:11.504
(Grinning)

00:24:16.774 --> 00:24:18.374
She's shivering.

00:24:19.174 --> 00:24:21.544
- Oh, my gosh!
- She's so nervous.

00:24:23.374 --> 00:24:25.114
- She suddenly got awkward.
- Yes.

00:24:25.384 --> 00:24:28.714
She totally lost control.

00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:32.960
He's very charismatic.

00:24:32.984 --> 00:24:34.194
(His presence overwhelms her.)

00:24:38.364 --> 00:24:39.694
Is that bobbed hair?

00:24:40.664 --> 00:24:42.894
- Right now? Yes.
- Yes.

00:24:46.764 --> 00:24:47.874
It suits you.

00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:51.744
Okay.

00:24:56.774 --> 00:24:58.990
(Even when he's shy, )

00:24:59.014 --> 00:25:02.754
(he can't take his eyes off Bon Hee.)

00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:06.660
I was so nervous when
I met the other women.

00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:07.670
Right.

00:25:07.694 --> 00:25:09.570
My face started to stiffen.

00:25:09.594 --> 00:25:10.940
I feel comfortable now.

00:25:10.964 --> 00:25:13.634
I don't know why I feel so comfortable.

00:25:14.134 --> 00:25:16.040
- Now that you're here?
- No, I...

00:25:16.064 --> 00:25:17.134
- Did you mean me?
- Yes.

00:25:18.664 --> 00:25:19.734
That's good.

00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:25.204
I think it'll be fun.

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.314
Yes.

00:25:28.574 --> 00:25:29.644
Let's go now.

00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:32.284
I'm getting nervous.

00:25:34.654 --> 00:25:37.224
- Her smile is completely different.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:25:37.884 --> 00:25:39.654
It's like he bewitched her.

00:25:40.524 --> 00:25:43.024
His vibe is

00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:45.570
nothing like that of a younger guy.

00:25:45.594 --> 00:25:47.670
- You're right.
- Bon Hee

00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:50.340
wasn't exactly the gentle one

00:25:50.364 --> 00:25:52.410
- among the females.
- Right.

00:25:52.434 --> 00:25:53.774
But now,

00:25:54.134 --> 00:25:58.120
I feel like she's behaving
that way because of Mu Jin.

00:25:58.144 --> 00:25:59.150
Right.

00:25:59.174 --> 00:26:02.274
He's the type of guy that
makes you act awkwardly.

00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:04.120
She knocked her down.

00:26:04.144 --> 00:26:05.644
Yes, he has that subtle vibe.

00:26:07.414 --> 00:26:10.960
(Another younger guy...)

00:26:10.984 --> 00:26:12.824
(waiting for a woman from another place.)

00:26:13.524 --> 00:26:15.754
What I was worried about was

00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:17.964
that I would seem too young to her.

00:26:19.524 --> 00:26:22.494
I was worried that I
would look too childish.

00:26:24.804 --> 00:26:26.934
I didn't want to call her "noon a."

00:26:32.744 --> 00:26:34.274
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:37.114
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:38.884 --> 00:26:40.784
- Did you just get here?
- Yes.

00:26:44.884 --> 00:26:46.784
(Peeking)

00:26:47.594 --> 00:26:48.930
(Ye Eun picked Golden Retriever.)

00:26:48.954 --> 00:26:50.340
He looks like a Golden Retriever.

00:26:50.364 --> 00:26:53.170
(Anxious)

00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:55.134
He doesn't know where to look.

00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:58.734
I didn't know you'd enter so suddenly.

00:27:07.514 --> 00:27:09.690
Do you drink coffee?

00:27:09.714 --> 00:27:12.714
Yes, I love coffee.

00:27:13.754 --> 00:27:14.990
Thanks.

00:27:15.014 --> 00:27:16.230
(Golden Retriever turns to drink.)

00:27:16.254 --> 00:27:17.884
The ice must have melted a little.

00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:21.094
Why is he turning and drinking coffee?

00:27:21.294 --> 00:27:23.170
She's not that old!

00:27:23.194 --> 00:27:24.194
Right.

00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:25.540
(Laughing)

00:27:25.564 --> 00:27:26.594
That was cute.

00:27:27.034 --> 00:27:28.164
He's too tense.

00:27:28.334 --> 00:27:29.740
He's restless.

00:27:29.764 --> 00:27:32.740
- That's so cute.
- Golden Retriever

00:27:32.764 --> 00:27:34.180
- looks so cute.
- He does.

00:27:34.204 --> 00:27:36.980
He's completely different
from well-organized.

00:27:37.004 --> 00:27:38.204
(He's the opposite of Mu Jin.)

00:27:39.504 --> 00:27:42.114
May I ask your name?

00:27:42.674 --> 00:27:44.444
I'm Park Ye Eun.

00:27:44.544 --> 00:27:45.960
- Ye Eun?
- What's your name?

00:27:45.984 --> 00:27:48.454
- I'm Kim Sang Hyeon. Yes.
- Sang Hyeon.

00:27:50.114 --> 00:27:53.084
Ye Eun. Ms. Park?

00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:56.394
- "Ms. Park?"
- He's cute.

00:28:00.634 --> 00:28:01.611
(Spotting)

00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:02.994
I didn't notice that was here.

00:28:09.874 --> 00:28:11.504
(Exclaiming)

00:28:14.174 --> 00:28:16.074
- Are you feeling shy?
- Yes.

00:28:20.414 --> 00:28:22.614
- Do you...
- Yes.

00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:24.784
Why is it Golden Retriever?

00:28:25.684 --> 00:28:27.994
I've been told

00:28:28.954 --> 00:28:32.694
that I was like a puppy.

00:28:33.794 --> 00:28:34.840
I picked this card.

00:28:34.864 --> 00:28:36.394
- Did you?
- Yes.

00:28:36.834 --> 00:28:39.334
Can I ask you why you picked it?

00:28:41.674 --> 00:28:43.944
It's my type of guy.

00:28:45.574 --> 00:28:48.950
You must like guys who are like puppies.

00:28:48.974 --> 00:28:51.144
- Yes. I like puppies.
- I see.

00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:55.554
That's a pretty necklace.

00:29:01.854 --> 00:29:03.500
He should have said she was pretty.

00:29:03.524 --> 00:29:04.840
He can't even meet eyes.

00:29:04.864 --> 00:29:07.564
Mu Jin didn't just say she was pretty.

00:29:07.764 --> 00:29:10.164
He was looking straight at her,

00:29:10.264 --> 00:29:11.480
and said it so nonchalantly.

00:29:11.504 --> 00:29:13.340
(He had his eyes on
her and said it calmly.)

00:29:13.364 --> 00:29:16.250
But Sang Hyeon is very shy,

00:29:16.274 --> 00:29:19.620
and doesn't know where to look.

00:29:19.644 --> 00:29:21.190
The two are the exact opposite

00:29:21.214 --> 00:29:23.744
in terms of the way they
speak on a first encounter.

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:28.354
I've been told

00:29:29.784 --> 00:29:31.354
that I looked like a cat.

00:29:31.454 --> 00:29:32.700
Right.

00:29:32.724 --> 00:29:39.124
Do you like girls with cat-like faces?

00:29:39.724 --> 00:29:41.634
Yes, I do.

00:29:45.064 --> 00:29:47.174
Are you sure you don't
like the puppy types?

00:29:48.034 --> 00:29:51.744
No. I think I like a cat-like woman more.

00:29:52.274 --> 00:29:53.344
- Really?
- Yes.

00:29:55.114 --> 00:29:57.560
I have a cat-like face, so I
like a guy with a puppy-like face.

00:29:57.584 --> 00:29:59.044
Oh, the opposite.

00:30:02.584 --> 00:30:04.024
What types of girls are you into?

00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:07.194
I also like the opposite.

00:30:07.494 --> 00:30:08.954
Someone cold.

00:30:10.154 --> 00:30:12.264
I like a woman with a cold, cat-like face.

00:30:13.094 --> 00:30:15.964
I've never heard of a
cold, cat-like face before.

00:30:16.464 --> 00:30:20.310
I'm usually smiley, and I rarely get angry.

00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:24.150
I prefer someone who I
can be considerate toward.

00:30:24.174 --> 00:30:26.980
Rather than being
considerate toward each other,

00:30:27.004 --> 00:30:30.074
I like someone who's honest.

00:30:30.274 --> 00:30:31.644
I'm very honest.

00:30:33.884 --> 00:30:34.861
(Flustered)

00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:36.184
Don't be too honest, though.

00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:38.584
You might hurt my feelings.

00:30:41.994 --> 00:30:43.554
Yes. So, there's that.

00:30:44.964 --> 00:30:46.870
(His hands are sweating.)

00:30:46.894 --> 00:30:50.634
What's your... I can't quite phrase it well.

00:30:51.364 --> 00:30:53.410
Are you usually

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:57.620
into guys who are big,

00:30:57.644 --> 00:30:58.750
and masculine?

00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:00.674
Or do you like guys who are small and cute?

00:31:01.544 --> 00:31:06.044
Appearance-wise, I like someone
with big eyes with monolids.

00:31:06.544 --> 00:31:07.954
Big eyes with monolids?

00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:11.284
I do have monolids.

00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:12.824
You do.

00:31:13.484 --> 00:31:14.554
Just saying.

00:31:19.324 --> 00:31:21.834
And a guy who looks pretty when he smiles.

00:31:23.134 --> 00:31:25.264
I should try to smile prettily.

00:31:25.464 --> 00:31:26.441
Oh, my.

00:31:26.465 --> 00:31:27.950
(Although he feels awkward, )

00:31:27.974 --> 00:31:29.874
(he says what he needs
to say to win her over.)

00:31:31.904 --> 00:31:32.904
And I prefer

00:31:34.274 --> 00:31:37.844
a man who takes good care of himself.

00:31:38.684 --> 00:31:40.560
I take pretty good care of myself.

00:31:40.584 --> 00:31:41.584
Goodness.

00:31:45.754 --> 00:31:47.600
(The awkward...)

00:31:47.624 --> 00:31:49.524
(yet thrilling first encounter ends.)

00:31:51.324 --> 00:31:53.770
(At that moment, )

00:31:53.794 --> 00:31:58.810
(another guy is waiting for a woman.)

00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:01.374
He has a big build. He's very tall.

00:32:01.604 --> 00:32:04.320
I've dated lots of older
women since I was younger

00:32:04.344 --> 00:32:05.544
because of how I look.

00:32:05.644 --> 00:32:08.714
I had dated a lot of older women.

00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:10.644
I liked it.

00:32:10.744 --> 00:32:12.044
He looks good.

00:32:23.624 --> 00:32:25.294
She gives off a different vibe.

00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:27.094
Hello.

00:32:34.534 --> 00:32:36.374
That height difference
makes my heart flutter.

00:32:36.734 --> 00:32:39.444
Are you "crunchy outside, tender inside?"

00:32:40.044 --> 00:32:42.174
Pardon? Oh, right.

00:32:43.514 --> 00:32:44.544
That's me.

00:32:50.584 --> 00:32:51.930
So, he's "crunchy outside, tender inside."

00:32:51.954 --> 00:32:52.984
(Kim Hyeon Jun)

00:32:53.124 --> 00:32:54.200
(Yeong Gyeong picked
"crunchy outside, tender inside.")

00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:55.424
(Glancing)

00:32:55.854 --> 00:32:57.394
(Feeling shy)

00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:00.864
(Glancing)

00:33:01.094 --> 00:33:02.734
I get shy around strangers.

00:33:05.334 --> 00:33:07.874
- You do?
- Yes. How about you?

00:33:09.004 --> 00:33:11.174
- So do I.
- We're in trouble.

00:33:17.984 --> 00:33:21.354
(A "crunchy outside, tender inside"
meeting at a rainy train station)

00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:23.184
By the way,

00:33:24.384 --> 00:33:26.084
I think we're stuck here.

00:33:30.394 --> 00:33:32.164
I think we are.

00:33:32.964 --> 00:33:35.594
It's showering hard.

00:33:37.294 --> 00:33:38.334
It is.

00:33:42.134 --> 00:33:44.944
It suddenly started raining hard.

00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:47.374
It was more atmospheric,

00:33:48.714 --> 00:33:50.594
and it felt like I was in
a scene from a movie.

00:33:51.644 --> 00:33:54.030
- It does look like a movie.
- It's like a painting.

00:33:54.054 --> 00:33:55.054
Come with me.

00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:57.190
Will you be all right with those shoes?

00:33:57.214 --> 00:33:58.484
It's fine.

00:34:00.994 --> 00:34:04.094
Hold on. There's a huge puddle.

00:34:04.694 --> 00:34:06.424
- Step on these.
- Okay.

00:34:06.724 --> 00:34:08.810
Go on. It's dangerous.

00:34:08.834 --> 00:34:09.870
(Hyeon Jun seems naturally well-mannered.)

00:34:09.894 --> 00:34:12.464
- Go on.
- Thank you.

00:34:13.804 --> 00:34:15.934
This is getting interesting.

00:34:17.974 --> 00:34:21.720
(He walks her to her
car until she gets in.)

00:34:21.744 --> 00:34:22.744
All good?

00:34:22.874 --> 00:34:24.744
Yes. Thank you.

00:34:27.084 --> 00:34:28.690
Your jacket must be soaking wet.

00:34:28.714 --> 00:34:29.854
(His arm is soaked.)

00:34:31.284 --> 00:34:32.854
(It's rainier than expected.)

00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:34.330
There was lightning.

00:34:34.354 --> 00:34:36.200
(Scared)

00:34:36.224 --> 00:34:37.224
No way.

00:34:38.164 --> 00:34:40.064
(Looking)

00:34:41.494 --> 00:34:43.374
I don't think it's going
to stop any time soon.

00:34:43.734 --> 00:34:44.764
Should we switch seats?

00:34:45.464 --> 00:34:46.704
Should we?

00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:51.444
(He readily offers to drive.)

00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:56.090
I love this type of stuff.

00:34:56.114 --> 00:34:57.760
(Impressed)

00:34:57.784 --> 00:35:00.284
What does the rain have
to do with switching seats?

00:35:01.154 --> 00:35:02.930
- When it's raining...
- Shouldn't you

00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:05.060
- hit the road as soon as possible?
- It's harder to drive

00:35:05.084 --> 00:35:07.060
- in the rain.
- Oh, I see.

00:35:07.084 --> 00:35:09.624
It's a heavy rain, so it's harder to see.

00:35:10.424 --> 00:35:12.040
He's naturally considerate.

00:35:12.064 --> 00:35:13.424
(He understood.)

00:35:14.534 --> 00:35:17.464
I wasn't hesitant because she was older.

00:35:18.064 --> 00:35:19.480
Instead, she was mature,

00:35:19.504 --> 00:35:21.134
and I could learn a lot from her.

00:35:21.604 --> 00:35:23.704
Our relationship was calmer.

00:35:25.974 --> 00:35:29.344
(They meet for the first time.)

00:35:32.914 --> 00:35:34.854
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:36.454 --> 00:35:38.354
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:39.084 --> 00:35:40.584
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:35:41.194 --> 00:35:42.524
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

00:35:43.194 --> 00:35:45.164
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

00:35:45.264 --> 00:35:46.664
He can't look her in the eyes.

00:35:48.464 --> 00:35:50.510
"The day flies by." I'm dying to find out.

00:35:50.534 --> 00:35:52.580
What? Oh, right.

00:35:52.604 --> 00:35:53.904
- Is this you?
- It is.

00:35:54.404 --> 00:35:55.510
(Ji Won picked "the day flies by.")

00:35:55.534 --> 00:35:57.580
- "The day flies by."
- So, you picked it based on that.

00:35:57.604 --> 00:35:59.074
- Yes.
- I had no idea.

00:36:00.374 --> 00:36:01.944
What's your name?

00:36:02.874 --> 00:36:04.320
I'm Park Sang Won.

00:36:04.344 --> 00:36:06.120
- Park Sang Won?
- Sang Won.

00:36:06.144 --> 00:36:07.884
- What is your name?
- I'm Park Ji Won.

00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:11.784
"If you're with me, your
ears will never be bored."

00:36:12.254 --> 00:36:13.584
That means I'm chatty.

00:36:16.324 --> 00:36:18.964
I don't like silence in conversations.

00:36:22.064 --> 00:36:23.870
You seem very calm right now.

00:36:23.894 --> 00:36:25.740
I know. I'm trying hard to
suppress my urge to chat.

00:36:25.764 --> 00:36:26.764
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:36:27.304 --> 00:36:30.604
- But you should make my day fly by.
- That's right.

00:36:32.344 --> 00:36:33.474
Give me a few moments.

00:36:34.004 --> 00:36:35.284
We have a lot of time, you know.

00:36:35.774 --> 00:36:37.144
We still have much time.

00:36:38.584 --> 00:36:39.760
(Ji Won leads Sang Won,
who's nervous, naturally.)

00:36:39.784 --> 00:36:42.654
- I see that Ji Won's very cheerful.
- Yes, indeed.

00:36:42.984 --> 00:36:45.324
Have you ever dated an older woman?

00:36:46.754 --> 00:36:48.654
- Yes, I have.
- I see.

00:36:49.524 --> 00:36:53.894
I've dated two older
women, both for over a year.

00:36:54.664 --> 00:36:57.364
Were the ladies you dated nice?

00:36:58.204 --> 00:37:00.664
They were more stable than younger ones.

00:37:01.234 --> 00:37:03.104
Before I met them,

00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:06.174
I dated some younger women.

00:37:07.504 --> 00:37:10.114
- I found them mentally unstable.
- I see.

00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:13.244
But it was different when
I dated older women.

00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:15.754
Since they had already stabled their lives,

00:37:16.514 --> 00:37:18.394
there were not a lot of
changes in their lives.

00:37:19.084 --> 00:37:20.760
So we didn't have a lot of conflicts.

00:37:20.784 --> 00:37:23.144
Everything would be fine as
long as I didn't cause trouble.

00:37:25.864 --> 00:37:27.940
(The romantic first meeting
of the participants is over.)

00:37:27.964 --> 00:37:30.040
We've watched

00:37:30.064 --> 00:37:31.710
- how all participants met 1-on-1.
- Yes.

00:37:31.734 --> 00:37:35.504
Which of those four couples
made your heart flutter?

00:37:35.634 --> 00:37:36.810
I pick Mr. Yes.

00:37:36.834 --> 00:37:38.480
- He spoke casually to his partner.
- Right, Yes Mu Jin.

00:37:38.504 --> 00:37:40.150
And the way he wrinkled his nose.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:41.290
- That's right.
- Yes.

00:37:41.314 --> 00:37:43.520
As for the other couples,

00:37:43.544 --> 00:37:46.320
- the women seemed to take the lead.
- Right.

00:37:46.344 --> 00:37:47.590
Mu Jin was the only guy

00:37:47.614 --> 00:37:49.884
- who seemed to be the leader.
- That's right.

00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:53.184
Sang Hyeon seemed like a man
who'd be devoted to a relationship.

00:37:53.484 --> 00:37:55.824
I think his heart wouldn't
change once he falls in love.

00:37:56.354 --> 00:37:59.100
He didn't know how to express his feelings.

00:37:59.124 --> 00:38:01.070
The way he acted struck me as cute.

00:38:01.094 --> 00:38:03.454
- He seemed innocent to you.
- It brings out your affection.

00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:05.864
What do you think about Sang Won?

00:38:06.204 --> 00:38:08.604
I was excited to see

00:38:08.904 --> 00:38:10.750
how he'd entertain his partner.

00:38:10.774 --> 00:38:12.874
- But he seemed unexpectedly shy.
- Right.

00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:15.490
So I thought he was a
younger man after all.

00:38:15.514 --> 00:38:17.490
Was he very nervous to meet an older woman?

00:38:17.514 --> 00:38:19.420
- I think he was very nervous.
- Yes, because she's older than him.

00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:22.360
- Honestly, a man like Hyeon Jun...
- Right.

00:38:22.384 --> 00:38:23.960
Makes me feel comfortable.

00:38:23.984 --> 00:38:25.860
- I knew you would like him.
- He seemed

00:38:25.884 --> 00:38:28.700
- to be a manly and attentive type.
- Right, he's manliest of all.

00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:30.154
- He's very attractive.
- Indeed.

00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:32.640
- He's very...
- Hye Jin, your eyes are sparkling.

00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:33.970
- I'm completely into it.
- Right.

00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:35.494
Show us the rest. I'm so curious.

00:38:37.394 --> 00:38:38.604
That must be it.

00:38:39.004 --> 00:38:40.334
It looks so fancy.

00:38:41.704 --> 00:38:43.404
I think we're the first to arrive.

00:38:44.704 --> 00:38:45.944
We're the first to arrive.

00:38:48.414 --> 00:38:50.644
- I'm glad it's not raining.
- Right.

00:38:52.444 --> 00:38:53.544
This must be it.

00:38:59.654 --> 00:39:01.554
(Yeon House)

00:39:01.794 --> 00:39:04.070
(The place they arrived at is...)

00:39:04.094 --> 00:39:05.071
(Yeon House)

00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:06.424
Yeon House.

00:39:07.424 --> 00:39:08.824
I wonder we're the first to arrive.

00:39:09.664 --> 00:39:11.180
- This must be it.
- Maybe we should...

00:39:11.204 --> 00:39:12.724
(The first couple: Bon Hee and Mu Jin)

00:39:14.104 --> 00:39:16.304
- (- Impressive.
- (It's nice.)

00:39:20.004 --> 00:39:22.090
(This is Yeon House...)

00:39:22.114 --> 00:39:25.184
(where the older women and the
younger men will stay together.)

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:26.814
It's huge.

00:39:29.914 --> 00:39:31.054
It has a swimming pool too.

00:39:32.484 --> 00:39:33.584
Exactly.

00:39:34.024 --> 00:39:36.654
A lot of things will happen here.

00:39:39.324 --> 00:39:42.964
(The place where you forget your
age and focus solely on your feelings)

00:39:43.134 --> 00:39:44.240
(Amazed)

00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:45.410
(Exclaiming in awe)

00:39:45.434 --> 00:39:47.304
It's practically a castle.

00:39:47.904 --> 00:39:49.450
I wonder what will happen in this house.

00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:50.550
(The romance in Yeon House
is completely unpredictable.)

00:39:50.574 --> 00:39:52.420
What kind of wild,
crazy things will happen?

00:39:52.444 --> 00:39:54.020
(The romance in Yeon House
is completely unpredictable.)

00:39:54.044 --> 00:39:55.474
Would you like to open it?

00:40:03.784 --> 00:40:06.054
(Putting the slippers down)

00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:07.854
Thank you.

00:40:13.724 --> 00:40:14.894
(Amazed)

00:40:15.594 --> 00:40:18.264
It's... Oh, my. It's all
furnished like a house.

00:40:21.174 --> 00:40:22.380
(1st floor, common area)

00:40:22.404 --> 00:40:23.974
My goodness. This place is so nice.

00:40:27.774 --> 00:40:30.144
(1st floor, kitchen)

00:40:31.444 --> 00:40:33.114
I guess we eat here.

00:40:35.454 --> 00:40:40.854
(The area next to the kitchen
where they can eat together)

00:40:41.754 --> 00:40:44.464
(1st floor, dining room)

00:40:44.794 --> 00:40:47.224
These are real flowers.
Do you like flowers?

00:40:47.594 --> 00:40:48.734
Yes, I like flowers.

00:40:50.064 --> 00:40:51.204
I thought they were fake.

00:40:52.104 --> 00:40:54.810
I like flowers so much. I
can tell if it's real right away.

00:40:54.834 --> 00:40:56.210
- You can tell by looking at it?
- Yes.

00:40:56.234 --> 00:40:57.234
(Smiling)

00:40:58.574 --> 00:41:00.704
I go to a flower market too.

00:41:01.674 --> 00:41:03.474
- You go to a flower market?
- Yes.

00:41:04.844 --> 00:41:06.314
- Shall we go upstairs?
- Yes.

00:41:09.414 --> 00:41:10.614
It's big.

00:41:15.054 --> 00:41:16.794
- It's really nice.
- Indeed.

00:41:19.264 --> 00:41:20.241
(2nd floor, common area)

00:41:20.265 --> 00:41:22.434
I guess this is where we can have a chat.

00:41:23.464 --> 00:41:27.564
(The space where honest and
serious conversations will occur)

00:41:29.204 --> 00:41:33.104
(2nd floor, girls' room)

00:41:33.204 --> 00:41:34.644
So each of us will have one.

00:41:37.144 --> 00:41:38.220
(3rd floor, guys' room)

00:41:38.244 --> 00:41:39.984
- This is the guys' room.
- Right.

00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:43.490
Terrace.

00:41:43.514 --> 00:41:44.654
(3rd floor, terrace)

00:41:45.984 --> 00:41:47.084
The view is nice.

00:41:49.694 --> 00:41:54.024
(The luxurious and private
space only for the participants)

00:41:54.794 --> 00:41:56.494
What color do you like?

00:41:56.894 --> 00:41:59.564
- I like neutral colors. Yes.
- Neutral colors?

00:42:01.134 --> 00:42:02.304
Colors that don't stand out.

00:42:02.934 --> 00:42:05.474
What color would you
pick if you had to pick one?

00:42:06.174 --> 00:42:08.114
Well... I guess I'd pick green.

00:42:08.344 --> 00:42:09.950
Dark green.

00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:11.174
Oh, really?

00:42:13.984 --> 00:42:18.624
(There's one room they
haven't checked out yet.)

00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:21.894
It's locked.

00:42:22.624 --> 00:42:23.700
- It's locked.
- Sorry?

00:42:23.724 --> 00:42:25.664
(The door is locked.)

00:42:25.894 --> 00:42:28.170
- What is it?
- What is it?

00:42:28.194 --> 00:42:30.074
(What could be the
purpose of the locked room?)

00:42:30.964 --> 00:42:35.304
(This room is unlocked only once a day.)

00:42:36.434 --> 00:42:39.544
(The chamber of secrets)

00:42:39.874 --> 00:42:40.944
"The chamber of secrets?"

00:42:41.874 --> 00:42:43.720
(They can guess a participant's
age in the chamber of secrets.)

00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:46.290
I think they can get a hint
on someone's age in there.

00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:47.660
(They can guess a participant's
age in the chamber of secrets.)

00:42:47.684 --> 00:42:49.724
I guess they can get
information about one another.

00:42:50.754 --> 00:42:52.960
(Could it be possible...)

00:42:52.984 --> 00:42:55.954
(for love to transcend age differences?)

00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:58.471
(Who will enter this room?
(And how will he or she do it?)

00:42:58.495 --> 00:42:59.594
I'm so curious.

00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:03.594
Oh, my. It's so beautiful.

00:43:09.974 --> 00:43:13.304
(The second couple: Ye Eun and Sang Hyeon)

00:43:18.414 --> 00:43:19.614
One person must have arrived.

00:43:22.554 --> 00:43:23.584
(Staggering)

00:43:25.084 --> 00:43:27.084
(Chuckling)

00:43:28.254 --> 00:43:29.554
Thank you.

00:43:31.794 --> 00:43:33.424
(Impressed)

00:43:38.604 --> 00:43:40.434
Can we take a look around?

00:43:45.944 --> 00:43:48.174
- Hello.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

00:43:49.174 --> 00:43:50.750
I'm glad to see you again. Don't you?

00:43:50.774 --> 00:43:54.020
Take a look around. There's a kitchen here.

00:43:54.044 --> 00:43:55.924
And don't forget to
check what's in the fridge.

00:43:56.284 --> 00:43:59.960
- Did you have a look?
- Yes, it has four stories.

00:43:59.984 --> 00:44:00.961
Really?

00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:03.524
- He hid behind his partner.
- My goodness.

00:44:05.394 --> 00:44:07.664
- He's so cute.
- He's cute.

00:44:07.794 --> 00:44:09.354
- He really is like a puppy.
- How cute.

00:44:11.734 --> 00:44:12.940
Let's look around.

00:44:12.964 --> 00:44:13.941
(Avoiding eye contact)

00:44:13.965 --> 00:44:15.750
- I'm so excited.
- I see.

00:44:15.774 --> 00:44:17.110
(Wherever Ye Eun goes, )

00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:20.544
(Sang Hyeon goes.)

00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:22.990
This place makes me feel
comfortable for some reason.

00:44:23.014 --> 00:44:26.060
- He's following her around.
- My goodness.

00:44:26.084 --> 00:44:27.684
(Following)

00:44:27.714 --> 00:44:28.990
What is this?

00:44:29.014 --> 00:44:30.284
We have pasta noodles.

00:44:30.814 --> 00:44:32.284
(Surprised)

00:44:33.184 --> 00:44:34.824
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:44:35.024 --> 00:44:36.070
When did you get here?

00:44:36.094 --> 00:44:37.954
- We just got here.
- I see.

00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:40.864
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:44:40.924 --> 00:44:42.804
- It's nice to meet you.
- I'm glad to meet you.

00:44:43.194 --> 00:44:44.980
Right. See? Mu Jin is different.

00:44:45.004 --> 00:44:46.680
- He greeted them right away...
- That's right.

00:44:46.704 --> 00:44:48.280
And came up to them to have a chat.

00:44:48.304 --> 00:44:49.784
- He approached them first.
- Exactly.

00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:52.674
(Glancing)

00:44:54.944 --> 00:44:55.990
Have a look around.

00:44:56.014 --> 00:44:57.094
(He already feels at home.)

00:44:58.544 --> 00:45:02.384
(After greeting them briefly,
Mu Jin goes to Bon Hee.)

00:45:02.584 --> 00:45:04.224
- Shall we check if there's water?
- Okay.

00:45:05.324 --> 00:45:06.724
I want something to drink too.

00:45:12.764 --> 00:45:16.034
(Mu Jin looks for a cup.)

00:45:17.894 --> 00:45:18.934
Here's a cup.

00:45:19.304 --> 00:45:20.944
I think you can just rinse it with water.

00:45:24.374 --> 00:45:26.144
(Here you go.)

00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:30.614
(He checks Bon Hee's cup.)

00:45:33.584 --> 00:45:34.584
(Glancing)

00:45:39.424 --> 00:45:41.254
(Sighing)

00:45:43.594 --> 00:45:44.794
(Picking up)

00:45:46.094 --> 00:45:47.370
What's that cup?

00:45:47.394 --> 00:45:49.164
I think we can use this too.

00:45:49.964 --> 00:45:51.940
Are you washing it for me?

00:45:51.964 --> 00:45:53.034
(Nodding)

00:45:53.104 --> 00:45:54.874
(Smiling)

00:45:54.904 --> 00:45:58.320
(The cup she received from Sang Hyeon)

00:45:58.344 --> 00:45:59.750
(Surprised)

00:45:59.774 --> 00:46:00.780
She put it in there.

00:46:00.804 --> 00:46:02.620
He might be subtly keeping
Sang Hyeon in check.

00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:04.714
- My goodness.
- It's just the beginning.

00:46:05.444 --> 00:46:07.744
- Mind if I just wash it with water?
- Not at all.

00:46:11.584 --> 00:46:12.624
Thank you.

00:46:18.864 --> 00:46:21.464
Oh, he saw that. He saw what happened.

00:46:22.764 --> 00:46:23.764
Oh, it worked.

00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:32.580
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:32.604 --> 00:46:34.520
- Go on in.
- Hello.

00:46:34.544 --> 00:46:35.814
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:38.074
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:41.244
I see you guys are here already.

00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:46.824
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:50.124 --> 00:46:52.264
- It feels like we're late.
- Exactly.

00:46:54.094 --> 00:46:55.364
Can we just sit down?

00:46:56.634 --> 00:46:57.910
You can sit on the floor or on the sofa.

00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:00.464
Please sit anywhere you want. We did so.

00:47:02.104 --> 00:47:03.134
It's nice.

00:47:03.634 --> 00:47:06.874
(Mu Jin is the last to join them.)

00:47:07.644 --> 00:47:09.114
(Glancing)

00:47:12.484 --> 00:47:16.760
(He goes past Ji Won...)

00:47:16.784 --> 00:47:17.960
(and sits next to Bon Hee.)

00:47:17.984 --> 00:47:18.984
Was that necessary?

00:47:20.054 --> 00:47:22.130
He went so far from
everyone to sit next to her.

00:47:22.154 --> 00:47:23.154
(Satisfied)

00:47:24.124 --> 00:47:25.124
Yes.

00:47:27.124 --> 00:47:29.634
She seems happy. Bon Hee must be happy.

00:47:30.094 --> 00:47:31.910
(Of course, she is.)

00:47:31.934 --> 00:47:33.204
May I ask your names, please?

00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:35.180
I'm Kim Mu Jin.

00:47:35.204 --> 00:47:37.910
- Mu Jin? Oh, I see.
- Yes, Kim Mu Jin.

00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:40.074
That's why his keyword
was "well-organized."

00:47:41.204 --> 00:47:42.244
- Right?
- Yes.

00:47:43.544 --> 00:47:44.824
The one who wanted to have meat.

00:47:45.184 --> 00:47:46.664
- Yes, that's him.
- "Well-organized."

00:47:48.754 --> 00:47:50.584
I'm Ji Won.

00:47:51.114 --> 00:47:53.524
- What's your full name?
- I'm Park Ji Won.

00:47:56.854 --> 00:47:58.364
What is your name?

00:47:58.464 --> 00:48:00.170
I'm Kim Sang Hyeon.

00:48:00.194 --> 00:48:01.464
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

00:48:02.194 --> 00:48:03.264
The puppy-like one.

00:48:04.334 --> 00:48:06.614
- Oh, "Golden Retriever?"
- Oh, you all know our keywords.

00:48:08.834 --> 00:48:10.274
I'm Park Sang Won.

00:48:12.374 --> 00:48:13.374
Sang Won...

00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:15.814
Park Sang Won...

00:48:16.544 --> 00:48:19.884
(Awkward)

00:48:21.284 --> 00:48:23.454
- We should let them in.
- Oh, hello.

00:48:24.654 --> 00:48:25.660
Hello.

00:48:25.684 --> 00:48:29.430
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:48:29.454 --> 00:48:30.454
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:48:32.624 --> 00:48:34.670
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:36.294
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:43.604
- Let's all sit down for now.
- He was watching her.

00:48:43.874 --> 00:48:46.644
They finally met one
another. They all gathered now.

00:48:49.444 --> 00:48:51.044
What were you doing?

00:48:51.244 --> 00:48:53.944
- We were introducing ourselves.
- Just now.

00:48:54.544 --> 00:48:57.254
Hello. I am Kim Hyeon Jun.

00:48:57.454 --> 00:49:00.830
I am Kim Yeong Gyeong.
It's nice to meet you all.

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:02.554
It's nice to meet you.

00:49:06.164 --> 00:49:09.234
(The older women and the
younger men finally gathered.)

00:49:09.734 --> 00:49:12.504
But they didn't seem to
be much older than me.

00:49:16.234 --> 00:49:19.544
I think they're only a
few years older than me.

00:49:22.874 --> 00:49:25.544
I didn't get that kind of feeling.

00:49:26.284 --> 00:49:27.644
Like they were much older than me.

00:49:29.414 --> 00:49:32.624
To me, they didn't seem
to be a lot older than me.

00:49:35.454 --> 00:49:40.194
(The story of the older women
and the younger men begins.)

00:49:40.624 --> 00:49:44.134
To me, the ladies don't seem any older

00:49:45.534 --> 00:49:47.234
than the early 30s.

00:49:47.464 --> 00:49:50.374
- They don't seem that old.
- I agree.

00:49:50.574 --> 00:49:52.180
I can't even guess how old they are.

00:49:52.204 --> 00:49:53.844
- You don't have any idea?
- No.

00:49:54.774 --> 00:49:55.920
Let me remind you. Two of them

00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:57.620
- have a twelve-year age gap.
- I'm worried.

00:49:57.644 --> 00:50:00.060
That will cause a huge stir.

00:50:00.084 --> 00:50:01.844
- Right. I think it will.
- My point exactly.

00:50:03.684 --> 00:50:05.830
There's a lot of stuff here. Can I sit here?

00:50:05.854 --> 00:50:06.924
Yes, of course.

00:50:07.624 --> 00:50:09.124
I have no clue.

00:50:09.994 --> 00:50:11.224
But I think

00:50:12.224 --> 00:50:15.064
that all the guys have a job.

00:50:16.034 --> 00:50:17.310
(Laughing)

00:50:17.334 --> 00:50:19.454
Being younger than you
doesn't mean they have no job.

00:50:19.604 --> 00:50:22.150
(As an older woman,
she was worried about it.)

00:50:22.174 --> 00:50:24.510
They all seem very young.

00:50:24.534 --> 00:50:25.544
Right.

00:50:25.904 --> 00:50:28.274
They must be in their late 20s..

00:50:29.244 --> 00:50:30.714
Or early 30s.

00:50:33.944 --> 00:50:35.014
You know...

00:50:36.714 --> 00:50:37.830
They all seem to be
around the same age as me.

00:50:37.854 --> 00:50:41.630
I heard they were older than us,

00:50:41.654 --> 00:50:44.224
but they don't feel so much older than me.

00:50:44.994 --> 00:50:47.924
Right. Don't I look even older than them?

00:50:49.064 --> 00:50:50.794
Perhaps, you're the youngest of all.

00:50:53.634 --> 00:50:55.010
- Oh, gosh.
- That's possible.

00:50:55.034 --> 00:50:57.794
I don't want a man who's 188cm
tall to address me like a big brother.

00:50:58.944 --> 00:50:59.974
That's possible.

00:51:00.304 --> 00:51:03.120
Clearly, both the men and the women

00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:05.214
are very sensitive about the age.

00:51:05.614 --> 00:51:10.084
The guys seem rather excited
about what could happen.

00:51:10.284 --> 00:51:12.330
But the ladies seem
more worried than excited.

00:51:12.354 --> 00:51:13.554
- Right.
- Yes, I think so too.

00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:16.054
Shall we start preparing food?

00:51:17.824 --> 00:51:21.424
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won
are preparing a move-in party.)

00:51:22.134 --> 00:51:24.264
When this show airs,

00:51:26.064 --> 00:51:27.424
my parents will probably scold me.

00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:29.150
"You never do any house chores."

00:51:29.174 --> 00:51:31.480
I was thinking the same thing.
"Why wouldn't you do it at home?"

00:51:31.504 --> 00:51:34.304
Exactly. They'll say I'm
doing house chores actively

00:51:34.944 --> 00:51:36.444
to impress the girls.

00:51:38.374 --> 00:51:39.790
You can tell they're on the younger side

00:51:39.814 --> 00:51:41.320
by the conversation they're having.

00:51:41.344 --> 00:51:43.530
They're worried if they
might upset their parents.

00:51:43.554 --> 00:51:46.330
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won prepared...)

00:51:46.354 --> 00:51:49.654
(the Yeon House move-in party.)

00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:54.624
- Come down to the first floor.
- Okay.

00:51:55.594 --> 00:51:57.170
Shall we bring 1 bottle of red
wine and 1 bottle of white wine?

00:51:57.194 --> 00:51:58.194
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

00:51:58.394 --> 00:52:00.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:52:00.464 --> 00:52:01.640
(The older women and the
younger men will be together...)

00:52:01.664 --> 00:52:02.904
Thank you.

00:52:04.234 --> 00:52:05.480
(on their first night at Yeon House.)

00:52:05.504 --> 00:52:08.714
Maybe we can open it without a wine opener.

00:52:09.374 --> 00:52:10.850
I was right. We don't need an opener.

00:52:10.874 --> 00:52:13.184
I think we need one
for this bottle. Or not?

00:52:15.854 --> 00:52:20.054
Some of them could be
flustered in that situation.

00:52:21.454 --> 00:52:23.030
The ladies are watching him.

00:52:23.054 --> 00:52:24.900
- Oh, no.
- All eyes are on him.

00:52:24.924 --> 00:52:26.370
"All right. Let's see how you do it."

00:52:26.394 --> 00:52:27.514
Eight eyes are watching him.

00:52:29.034 --> 00:52:30.064
(Pressured)

00:52:30.394 --> 00:52:32.364
You can start without me.

00:52:32.904 --> 00:52:34.104
I'll take my time and open it.

00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:37.780
(Sang Won is struggling
to open the wine bottle.)

00:52:37.804 --> 00:52:38.844
- Goodness.
- Oh, boy.

00:52:41.004 --> 00:52:42.074
(Pulling it upward)

00:52:42.174 --> 00:52:44.174
(Flustered)

00:52:44.944 --> 00:52:46.314
(Pulling it upward)

00:52:46.744 --> 00:52:48.244
(The wine cork is broken.)

00:52:48.754 --> 00:52:49.984
Did he open it the wrong way?

00:52:50.684 --> 00:52:51.684
Oh, no.

00:52:52.054 --> 00:52:53.354
He's cute.

00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:55.954
He made the cork
disappear instead of the day.

00:52:56.054 --> 00:52:57.770
I can relate to that

00:52:57.794 --> 00:53:00.264
because I've never
opened a wine bottle before.

00:53:00.824 --> 00:53:02.670
Men around my age

00:53:02.694 --> 00:53:04.870
rarely choose wine when we have a drink.

00:53:04.894 --> 00:53:06.740
- I see.
- Right. That makes sense.

00:53:06.764 --> 00:53:07.764
(Oh, that makes sense.)

00:53:13.944 --> 00:53:15.750
- We have an emergency.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:53:15.774 --> 00:53:17.774
- It broke inside the bottle.
- Really?

00:53:19.084 --> 00:53:21.614
This is bad. We might
not be able to drink this.

00:53:22.954 --> 00:53:24.554
You should rotate it more.

00:53:25.254 --> 00:53:26.930
(Ji Won helps Sang Won, who's flustered.)

00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:27.954
All the way down.

00:53:28.254 --> 00:53:30.554
It's supposed to come
out. Why won't it work?

00:53:33.224 --> 00:53:34.970
- Shall I bring another one?
- I'll bring another bottle.

00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:36.134
Let's drink something else.

00:53:37.364 --> 00:53:39.664
- Anything?
- Anything would do. Thank you.

00:53:40.904 --> 00:53:43.204
(He came to the kitchen
to get a new bottle of wine.)

00:53:43.874 --> 00:53:44.934
I feel bad.

00:53:46.374 --> 00:53:48.420
- It's okay. That happens.
- It happens.

00:53:48.444 --> 00:53:49.514
It's not a big deal.

00:53:49.944 --> 00:53:51.014
It's okay.

00:53:52.214 --> 00:53:54.090
Hang on. Please don't comfort me.

00:53:54.114 --> 00:53:56.914
I feel like I caused big trouble.
I wasn't feeling that way.

00:53:59.454 --> 00:54:00.824
Would any of these do?

00:54:02.394 --> 00:54:04.094
Let's drink this one.

00:54:04.194 --> 00:54:07.024
This is a sweet, fruity type.

00:54:08.564 --> 00:54:10.434
- A fruity type?
- Yes.

00:54:10.534 --> 00:54:11.740
I don't know what it is.

00:54:11.764 --> 00:54:12.934
I don't know either.

00:54:13.034 --> 00:54:15.280
- It says "sweet."
- "Sweet?"

00:54:15.304 --> 00:54:16.281
"Sweet."

00:54:16.305 --> 00:54:18.844
(When you don't know,
choose something sweet.)

00:54:19.774 --> 00:54:21.990
Thank you for bringing
the wine. Shall we drink it?

00:54:22.014 --> 00:54:23.014
Yes, let's drink it.

00:54:23.044 --> 00:54:25.484
- It's good to meet you all.
- It's good to meet you all.

00:54:26.744 --> 00:54:32.354
(They start their first evening
at Yeon House with wine.)

00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:35.054
(Impressed)

00:54:35.224 --> 00:54:37.000
(The older women enjoy the wine.)

00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:38.024
(Exclaiming)

00:54:38.664 --> 00:54:40.664
(Nodding)

00:54:40.964 --> 00:54:43.594
(Meanwhile, the younger men...)

00:54:47.434 --> 00:54:49.574
(Frowning)

00:54:52.674 --> 00:54:53.780
(Looking around nervously)

00:54:53.804 --> 00:54:55.674
The guys don't seem to like it.

00:54:56.914 --> 00:54:57.944
He seems confused.

00:55:00.244 --> 00:55:03.454
(Coughing)

00:55:05.654 --> 00:55:06.684
"Well-organized!"

00:55:07.254 --> 00:55:09.134
You should drink it in a
well-organized manner.

00:55:10.124 --> 00:55:11.924
(Gazing)

00:55:12.424 --> 00:55:14.470
Like I said, things like
that make him cute.

00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:16.374
The ladies look at him
like they find him cute.

00:55:17.194 --> 00:55:19.904
(He has a piece of apple
to get rid of the aftertaste.)

00:55:20.364 --> 00:55:21.640
- Isn't the wine good?
- This wine is refreshing.

00:55:21.664 --> 00:55:23.384
- Yes, it's better than I expected.
- Right.

00:55:24.804 --> 00:55:27.250
- He's cute. Yes.
- He's so cute. Isn't he cute?

00:55:27.274 --> 00:55:30.644
(With a fresh mindset, he has another sip.)

00:55:35.554 --> 00:55:36.660
"Why would anyone drink this?"

00:55:36.684 --> 00:55:38.560
He drank wine and
reacted as if it were soju.

00:55:38.584 --> 00:55:40.530
Tell us honestly. I
understand that he looks cute,

00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:42.130
but isn't it a little frustrating
to watch him like that?

00:55:42.154 --> 00:55:43.600
Exactly. That's what I was curious about.

00:55:43.624 --> 00:55:45.600
- But he's Mu Jin.
- Gosh, seriously.

00:55:45.624 --> 00:55:46.670
He's Mr. Yes.

00:55:46.694 --> 00:55:47.764
He's invincible.

00:55:48.624 --> 00:55:50.294
How much alcohol can you drink at once?

00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:53.734
I can drink up to half a bottle of soju.

00:55:55.064 --> 00:55:56.074
It's true.

00:55:57.634 --> 00:56:01.580
I can drink one glass
of soju-beer cocktail.

00:56:01.604 --> 00:56:02.820
- One glass?
- One glass?

00:56:02.844 --> 00:56:04.074
Yes. One glass.

00:56:04.774 --> 00:56:06.384
- You're unbelievable.
- My goodness.

00:56:06.984 --> 00:56:08.284
Yes. About that much.

00:56:08.514 --> 00:56:10.314
You probably shouldn't be drinking then.

00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:13.384
Right. My face is starting to burn.

00:56:17.894 --> 00:56:19.594
My face is burning a little.

00:56:20.194 --> 00:56:21.300
Yes.

00:56:21.324 --> 00:56:22.794
The girls are surprised.

00:56:25.864 --> 00:56:27.764
But I drink soju quite well.

00:56:28.264 --> 00:56:30.150
I can handle 2 to 2
and a half bottles of soju.

00:56:30.174 --> 00:56:31.204
You can drink.

00:56:31.534 --> 00:56:34.144
I can drink about 1
and a half to 2 bottles.

00:56:34.644 --> 00:56:37.120
But I am not a big fan of soju,

00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:39.714
so I rarely drink soju.

00:56:40.414 --> 00:56:42.660
- What do you like to drink then?
- Which liquor then?

00:56:42.684 --> 00:56:43.884
I like whiskey.

00:56:44.214 --> 00:56:46.200
You must drink really well, I
mean you must love to drink.

00:56:46.224 --> 00:56:47.560
(Thinking)

00:56:47.584 --> 00:56:49.424
It tastes like wood, though.

00:56:50.454 --> 00:56:52.270
- Whiskey is expensive.
- But you can't drink.

00:56:52.294 --> 00:56:53.564
Do you like it?

00:56:55.834 --> 00:56:57.370
- She adores him.
- He's adorable.

00:56:57.394 --> 00:56:58.440
- He's adorable.
- She adores him, whatever he says.

00:56:58.464 --> 00:56:59.784
He says whiskey tastes like wood.

00:57:00.564 --> 00:57:02.334
It tastes like wood, though.

00:57:04.734 --> 00:57:06.274
It tastes like wood?

00:57:08.814 --> 00:57:10.950
He's the serious type.

00:57:10.974 --> 00:57:12.014
I know.

00:57:14.644 --> 00:57:15.954
Their eyes locked.

00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:19.684
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon
lock eyes with each other.)

00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:22.154
She's staring right at me.

00:57:23.094 --> 00:57:25.130
I guess I am sitting directly across you.

00:57:25.154 --> 00:57:26.924
I was trying hard not
to lock eyes with you.

00:57:28.724 --> 00:57:30.210
(Looking)

00:57:30.234 --> 00:57:31.264
I...

00:57:31.764 --> 00:57:33.304
Sang Hyeon is cute.

00:57:33.764 --> 00:57:39.074
(Mu Jin was quietly watching.)

00:57:39.374 --> 00:57:40.574
That can't be helped.

00:57:40.974 --> 00:57:42.320
You got something here.

00:57:42.344 --> 00:57:44.444
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:46.620
You got something here.

00:57:46.644 --> 00:57:48.684
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

00:57:53.884 --> 00:57:54.861
- What is it?
- Dust.

00:57:54.885 --> 00:57:55.954
- Dust.
- Dust?

00:57:57.424 --> 00:57:58.454
I see.

00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:01.870
I couldn't stop looking at it.

00:58:01.894 --> 00:58:06.034
(I couldn't stop looking at it.)

00:58:08.464 --> 00:58:11.234
That's like, "I can't stop looking at you."

00:58:11.574 --> 00:58:13.620
Bon Hee's attention is now on Mu Jin.

00:58:13.644 --> 00:58:16.074
It's the first day, and he'd
say something like that?

00:58:16.274 --> 00:58:18.114
What's wrong with that?

00:58:18.644 --> 00:58:19.690
(Infinitely amazed)

00:58:19.714 --> 00:58:21.190
- "I couldn't stop looking at it?"
- That's lovely.

00:58:21.214 --> 00:58:22.494
(He's the fearless younger man.)

00:58:22.914 --> 00:58:25.014
- Stop it.
- I can't help it.

00:58:25.524 --> 00:58:26.930
You got something here.

00:58:26.954 --> 00:58:28.994
- Can I get it for you?
- What is it?

00:58:29.154 --> 00:58:30.254
- Dust.
- Dust?

00:58:31.224 --> 00:58:32.324
I see.

00:58:35.064 --> 00:58:36.170
I couldn't stop looking at it.

00:58:36.194 --> 00:58:40.264
(I couldn't stop looking at it.)

00:58:47.604 --> 00:58:49.474
I heard you had to pick

00:58:49.974 --> 00:58:52.944
a keyword in the beginning.

00:58:53.044 --> 00:58:54.784
Among the keywords...

00:58:55.384 --> 00:58:56.654
What was it at the bottom?

00:58:56.984 --> 00:58:58.254
- "Well-organized?"
- Yes.

00:58:58.454 --> 00:59:02.354
He looked hard-working and responsible.

00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:04.394
That's why I picked it.

00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:08.894
She let me have it.

00:59:09.534 --> 00:59:11.240
- Did she?
- So he could've had

00:59:11.264 --> 00:59:13.134
the first date with Ji Won.

00:59:13.704 --> 00:59:15.010
What was your keyword?

00:59:15.034 --> 00:59:16.534
- What?
- What was it?

00:59:16.704 --> 00:59:18.804
It was "the day flies by."

00:59:19.374 --> 00:59:21.504
- But he didn't make it happen.
- It's midnight now.

00:59:22.374 --> 00:59:23.444
The day flew by.

00:59:24.044 --> 00:59:25.244
Shall we drink?

00:59:31.254 --> 00:59:32.700
Should we go back to
what we were discussing?

00:59:32.724 --> 00:59:36.000
For the gents, it would be older women.

00:59:36.024 --> 00:59:37.624
For the ladies, it would be younger men.

00:59:38.154 --> 00:59:40.624
Do you have an experience of dating one?

00:59:40.764 --> 00:59:44.794
I've dated older and younger women.

00:59:45.194 --> 00:59:47.640
But the two I dated for the
longest period were older.

00:59:47.664 --> 00:59:49.174
And we had a stable relationship.

00:59:49.934 --> 00:59:53.474
It made me think I am a good
match with an older woman.

00:59:55.504 --> 00:59:56.574
I mostly dated

00:59:57.474 --> 01:00:00.114
men younger than me.

01:00:00.484 --> 01:00:04.014
So I don't have any
prejudices against younger men.

01:00:08.924 --> 01:00:09.901
(Turning)

01:00:09.925 --> 01:00:10.954
Mu Jin?

01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:15.634
I don't really care about age.

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:20.804
But I got along better with older women.

01:00:23.134 --> 01:00:25.534
I don't care too much about the age though.

01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:30.644
But I think older women
were a better fit for me.

01:00:31.514 --> 01:00:33.344
Why were they a better fit?

01:00:34.514 --> 01:00:36.690
I don't know. The ones
I got along well with

01:00:36.714 --> 01:00:38.074
just happened to be older than me.

01:00:39.054 --> 01:00:40.154
I see.

01:00:42.924 --> 01:00:43.954
I

01:00:45.724 --> 01:00:47.170
Mostly dated older men.

01:00:47.194 --> 01:00:48.994
I've dated a younger man once.

01:00:50.494 --> 01:00:52.534
(Nodding)

01:00:54.204 --> 01:00:55.604
But as I got

01:00:56.974 --> 01:00:58.234
older,

01:00:58.734 --> 01:01:01.774
the level of maturity mattered
more. It matters more now.

01:01:03.214 --> 01:01:04.614
Yes. That's me.

01:01:07.814 --> 01:01:09.490
I think I'm similar.

01:01:09.514 --> 01:01:13.284
I've only experienced it once.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:16.554
But age isn't a huge factor.

01:01:17.794 --> 01:01:19.300
Having good conversations,

01:01:19.324 --> 01:01:20.924
and sharing the same core values...

01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:24.134
Those are more important to me.

01:01:26.904 --> 01:01:30.404
The person I most recently
dated was younger than me.

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:33.874
Even if I didn't end up
in a relationship with all,

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:36.244
most of the people I've dated

01:01:36.744 --> 01:01:40.544
were younger than me.

01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:42.214
It just happened naturally.

01:01:42.914 --> 01:01:46.224
I've mostly dated someone
younger or someone of my age.

01:01:48.554 --> 01:01:49.624
Yes.

01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:51.354
Well.

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:56.594
For me, this is a challenge.

01:01:59.764 --> 01:02:00.864
It's not ideal

01:02:02.704 --> 01:02:03.850
to lie, so...

01:02:03.874 --> 01:02:06.804
This is a challenge for me.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:10.474
He hasn't dated many older women.

01:02:10.744 --> 01:02:11.974
I guess so.

01:02:12.214 --> 01:02:15.314
I guess that's why he was that anxious.

01:02:15.384 --> 01:02:19.424
Sang Hyeon is different
from the other participants.

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:22.794
His focus is not on
who he likes at this point.

01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:25.434
But it is on whether he will
be able to have chemistry

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:26.664
with an older woman.

01:02:26.824 --> 01:02:28.764
He might be confused.

01:02:29.024 --> 01:02:31.640
He said it was a challenge.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:33.410
I think he might get very confused

01:02:33.434 --> 01:02:36.280
when their age gets revealed.

01:02:36.304 --> 01:02:37.574
Is he that young?

01:02:40.074 --> 01:02:42.144
- We got texts.
- Did we?

01:02:44.674 --> 01:02:47.784
(They receive texts.)

01:02:48.344 --> 01:02:49.584
I didn't get a text.

01:02:50.814 --> 01:02:52.154
I think only the ladies got one.

01:02:55.924 --> 01:02:57.800
In 15 minutes, send a love message

01:02:57.824 --> 01:02:59.870
to the person you are interested in.

01:02:59.894 --> 01:03:00.964
Love QR code?

01:03:01.324 --> 01:03:02.440
You can send anything to it.

01:03:02.464 --> 01:03:05.010
It could be a message, an
audio file, a photo, a video.

01:03:05.034 --> 01:03:06.664
(But make it anonymous.)

01:03:08.704 --> 01:03:12.004
(It's the day the men get
to read the ladies' minds.)

01:03:12.674 --> 01:03:14.320
(Who is...)

01:03:14.344 --> 01:03:17.344
(in the ladies' hearts tonight?)

01:03:17.474 --> 01:03:18.490
I got it.

01:03:18.514 --> 01:03:20.220
No, let's leave it like this for now.

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:22.284
(After the party, the younger
men are cleaning up.)

01:03:22.814 --> 01:03:24.454
(Looking around)

01:03:25.954 --> 01:03:28.524
(Ji Won hurriedly heads to the stairs.)

01:03:28.984 --> 01:03:31.354
(Running up)

01:03:33.924 --> 01:03:35.294
How do I do this?

01:03:36.764 --> 01:03:37.794
She's thinking.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.664
(Bon Hee heads to the stairs too.)

01:03:41.034 --> 01:03:44.434
That's not easy. What will
they send to the QR code?

01:03:44.734 --> 01:03:46.044
(Spotting Ji Won)

01:03:47.244 --> 01:03:49.544
(She retreats.)

01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:51.314
(Spotting Bon Hee)

01:03:54.044 --> 01:03:58.854
(She gets even further away.)

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:00.661
(Sighing)

01:04:00.685 --> 01:04:02.224
Make up your mind.

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:06.424
- Time to use my head, is it?
- Do you have one?

01:04:07.064 --> 01:04:08.664
Is there someone you're interested in?

01:04:09.734 --> 01:04:11.294
(Curious)

01:04:12.034 --> 01:04:13.210
(Sassy)

01:04:13.234 --> 01:04:14.264
It's a secret.

01:04:17.804 --> 01:04:19.780
Could it be not the one

01:04:19.804 --> 01:04:22.374
they went to pick up?

01:04:22.844 --> 01:04:25.190
I think a lot of them
have changed their minds.

01:04:25.214 --> 01:04:26.384
- You think so?
- I do.

01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:31.584
Are you the love-at-first-sight
type of a person?

01:04:32.284 --> 01:04:34.124
I am the love-at-first-sight
type of a person.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.800
Most men fall for the looks first,

01:04:36.824 --> 01:04:39.024
- and then slowly get to know her.
- Right.

01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:41.264
Is any of them your type?

01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:45.170
- Among them?
- I won't ask who it is.

01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:46.610
There is one.

01:04:46.634 --> 01:04:48.134
(There is one.)

01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:49.434
Is any of them your type?

01:04:50.134 --> 01:04:53.804
Considering the first impression,
there is someone who's my type.

01:04:56.344 --> 01:04:58.250
(Who are the ladies...)

01:04:58.274 --> 01:05:01.944
(that entered Sang Hyeon
and Hyeon Jun's hearts?)

01:05:06.684 --> 01:05:07.930
(The messages have been
sent. Go to the Love QR Zone...)

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:09.230
(and check the ladies' hearts.)

01:05:09.254 --> 01:05:10.294
It's here.

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:18.140
(Love QR Zone is...)

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.534
(where they get to check
each other's feelings.)

01:05:21.104 --> 01:05:24.510
(It's a place where you
can check the feelings...)

01:05:24.534 --> 01:05:27.874
(that were passed on through the QR code.)

01:05:28.404 --> 01:05:30.214
(Hyeon Jun)

01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:35.890
(When you scan your QR code, )

01:05:35.914 --> 01:05:39.830
(you can check the
feelings of the person...)

01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:42.284
(who sent a message to you.)

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:47.200
(On the first day of Yeon House, )

01:05:47.224 --> 01:05:51.063
(what kind of messages
will the men receive?)

01:05:51.424 --> 01:05:53.570
We have the Love QR Codes here too.

01:05:53.594 --> 01:05:54.624
What?

01:05:55.624 --> 01:05:58.994
(They can check the result
through the QR codes here too.)

01:05:59.134 --> 01:06:00.564
Who are you most curious about?

01:06:00.764 --> 01:06:02.480
- Yes Mu Jin.
- Mu Jin?

01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:03.874
Should I go check Mu Jin's?

01:06:04.104 --> 01:06:05.544
- I'd love that.
- I'd love that too.

01:06:07.544 --> 01:06:09.674
We are checking for the
messages he received, right?

01:06:10.214 --> 01:06:11.214
It's coming up.

01:06:11.714 --> 01:06:12.920
It really works!

01:06:12.944 --> 01:06:14.904
(They are the Love QR
Codes of the participants!)

01:06:15.784 --> 01:06:16.914
How many did he get?

01:06:17.214 --> 01:06:18.890
(I won't tell you.)

01:06:18.914 --> 01:06:20.924
I think Mu Jin would be popular.

01:06:21.084 --> 01:06:22.100
(Yes?)

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:24.854
I think Golden Retriever would be popular.

01:06:24.994 --> 01:06:27.440
Come on. Show us. We need to see it too.

01:06:27.464 --> 01:06:28.464
Show us.

01:06:31.894 --> 01:06:36.534
(Mu Jin is the first to
come to the Love QR Zone.)

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:43.174
(Sighing)

01:06:45.774 --> 01:06:48.084
(Nervous)

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:52.884
(The Love QR Code is
placed in front of Mu Jin.)

01:06:55.754 --> 01:07:01.740
(Did Mu Jin receive any love messages?)

01:07:01.764 --> 01:07:06.364
(It will be continued shortly.)

01:07:08.864 --> 01:07:16.864
(What kind of messages would
his Love QR Code contain?)

01:07:25.059 --> 01:07:26.765
(Two people have sent
messages to your Love QR Code.)

01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:28.229
- Two people.
- Two people. Goodness.

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:35.969
(Puzzled)

01:07:38.609 --> 01:07:43.285
(What's the first message
from the Love QR Code?)

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:44.339
It's a video.

01:07:44.709 --> 01:07:47.225
(First Love QR message)

01:07:47.249 --> 01:07:50.525
(First Love QR message is a
video of the living room sofa.)

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:51.619
Who could it be?

01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:56.459
(Tilting his head)

01:07:57.459 --> 01:08:01.459
(How about the second Love QR message?)

01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:09.545
(A photo of a green object?)

01:08:09.569 --> 01:08:10.769
- What is that?
- What is that?

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.239
(Smiling)

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:18.109
I think I know one person clearly.

01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:21.749
But I am not entirely sure
who the other person is.

01:08:22.879 --> 01:08:24.719
Could it be Ye Eun?

01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:30.019
When we were drinking wine,

01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:35.099
she was the one who
could see me from that angle.

01:08:36.329 --> 01:08:38.369
I would be shocked if it
turned out to be Ye Eun.

01:08:38.969 --> 01:08:41.099
I guess their eyes locked many times.

01:08:41.469 --> 01:08:42.675
I didn't see that coming though.

01:08:42.699 --> 01:08:44.659
(An unexpected result
sends them into confusion.)

01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:48.879
(Anxious)

01:08:52.549 --> 01:08:54.285
(Sang Hyeon is the second
person to check the Love QR Code.)

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:56.849
(Taking a deep breath)

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.319
I'm scared.

01:09:07.129 --> 01:09:10.175
(He takes a deep breath...)

01:09:10.199 --> 01:09:13.199
(and checks his Love QR Code.)

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:21.539
(Did anyone send a message to
Sang Hyeon's Love QR Code?)

01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:30.179
(One person has sent a
message to your Love QR Code.)

01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:38.659
(He received an image of a cat.)

01:09:39.589 --> 01:09:43.829
(Will Sang Hyeon recognize the cat image?)

01:09:45.929 --> 01:09:48.939
I really don't know. I'm puzzled.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:52.685
(He couldn't figure out
who the message was from.)

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:53.809
Wait.

01:09:54.139 --> 01:09:56.139
What? That can't happen.

01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:59.155
That's not it. I think he
had been so nervous

01:09:59.179 --> 01:10:00.755
that he forgot everything.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:03.495
He must've forgotten everything
they talked about during the date.

01:10:03.519 --> 01:10:06.489
It's clear that Ye Eun sent
the message to Sang Hyeon.

01:10:06.649 --> 01:10:09.935
They talked about dogs and cats so much.

01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:11.965
- Right.
- We figured it out right away.

01:10:11.989 --> 01:10:14.865
- Yes.
- But he can't figure it out.

01:10:14.889 --> 01:10:16.735
- That's surprising, isn't it?
- It's surprising.

01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:17.775
How can he not know it?

01:10:17.799 --> 01:10:18.829
(Frustrated)

01:10:19.169 --> 01:10:20.945
(With the mystery unsolved, )

01:10:20.969 --> 01:10:25.569
(With the mystery unsolved,
Sang Hyeon leaves the zone.)

01:10:27.009 --> 01:10:32.609
(Sang Won enters the Love QR Zone.)

01:10:44.519 --> 01:10:48.135
(For the first time, see
who has feelings for you...)

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:51.359
(through the Love QR Code.)

01:10:53.269 --> 01:11:00.169
(What kind of messages would
Sang Won have received?)

01:11:02.809 --> 01:11:03.809
What?

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:05.149
Who is it?

01:11:07.849 --> 01:11:09.379
(Looks around)

01:11:09.719 --> 01:11:10.696
(Tilts his head)

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.089
(Chuckles)

01:11:13.689 --> 01:11:18.759
(What message did Sang Won
receive through the Love QR Code?)

01:11:19.629 --> 01:11:20.659
Two people?

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:28.229
(You have no message on your Love QR Code.)

01:11:28.429 --> 01:11:32.369
(Poor Sang Won.)

01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:33.939
What do we do?

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:40.079
(Tilts his head)

01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:45.789
(Finding it hard to believe,
he checks it once again.)

01:11:50.119 --> 01:11:51.165
(The result is the same.)

01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:53.589
He keeps refreshing the page,
but he still doesn't have any.

01:11:54.659 --> 01:11:56.399
Oh, dear.

01:11:58.329 --> 01:11:59.369
(Trembles)

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:08.485
(What does this chuckle mean?)

01:12:08.509 --> 01:12:09.979
I was frustrated.

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:13.855
I knew it could happen.

01:12:13.879 --> 01:12:15.959
And I told myself that I
shouldn't get disappointed.

01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:18.255
But when it actually happened,

01:12:18.279 --> 01:12:19.819
it hit me quite hard.

01:12:24.789 --> 01:12:29.399
(After checking the Love QR
Code, Sang Won became puzzled.)

01:12:32.729 --> 01:12:37.899
It made me think I should
approach them more seriously now.

01:12:39.409 --> 01:12:41.385
- Oh, dear. He's adorable.
- Goodness.

01:12:41.409 --> 01:12:42.689
He looks like he lost the world.

01:12:43.279 --> 01:12:46.149
- He looks like he's in shock.
- He's shocked.

01:12:46.309 --> 01:12:48.995
- He's very good-looking.
- Yes.

01:12:49.019 --> 01:12:51.849
He's never experienced
something like this, so he is flustered.

01:12:52.019 --> 01:12:54.649
This is what seemed to
have gone through his mind.

01:12:55.619 --> 01:12:57.395
"Did this just happen to me?"

01:12:57.419 --> 01:12:59.889
- That's how it felt.
- Right.

01:13:00.089 --> 01:13:03.759
(The last one to check the
Love QR Code is Hyeon Jun.)

01:13:04.559 --> 01:13:08.145
(He checks the message
on his Love QR Code...)

01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:10.699
(for the first time.)

01:13:12.769 --> 01:13:16.555
(One person has sent a
message to your Love QR Code.)

01:13:16.579 --> 01:13:20.079
(One person has sent a
message to your Love QR Code.)

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:22.479
I wonder what he received.

01:13:23.579 --> 01:13:27.225
(Hyeon Jun received one photo.)

01:13:27.249 --> 01:13:29.865
What's that? It's pasta and a wine opener.

01:13:29.889 --> 01:13:30.889
What?

01:13:31.089 --> 01:13:32.965
Is it their height difference?

01:13:32.989 --> 01:13:34.865
- No.
- No?

01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:37.759
- Their height difference?
- Why pasta and a wine opener then?

01:13:37.999 --> 01:13:39.399
It's difficult.

01:13:40.799 --> 01:13:44.869
(Does Hyeon Jun know who
the Love QR message is from?)

01:13:46.639 --> 01:13:49.939
I have no clue about who sent the message.

01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:53.579
I have no idea. I have no clue.

01:13:57.119 --> 01:13:58.849
What's your favorite food?

01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:00.565
I like pasta.

01:14:00.589 --> 01:14:03.159
- You like pasta.
- I love pasta.

01:14:04.059 --> 01:14:05.665
I like pasta too.

01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:06.859
You like pasta?

01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:08.559
- Pasta.
- They had that conversation.

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:13.475
I thought perhaps he
might remember the things

01:14:13.499 --> 01:14:15.299
we talked about earlier.

01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:17.815
Oh, dear. They talked about it.

01:14:17.839 --> 01:14:20.385
She looked for it and took a picture of it.

01:14:20.409 --> 01:14:21.645
She did.

01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:24.279
(Yeong Gyeong sent a photo
of Hyeon Jun's favorite, pasta.)

01:14:24.539 --> 01:14:26.085
He should've known.

01:14:26.109 --> 01:14:27.949
Poor Yeong Gyeong.

01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:34.019
(Ye Eun sent an image
of a cat to Sang Hyeon.)

01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:38.929
I am cat-like.

01:14:39.089 --> 01:14:40.129
Right.

01:14:40.429 --> 01:14:42.069
Do you like someone who looks like a cat?

01:14:42.459 --> 01:14:44.459
Yes. I like someone who is cat-like.

01:14:48.099 --> 01:14:51.199
(The cat-like Ye Eun expressed
herself with the cat image.)

01:14:51.499 --> 01:14:54.045
- They had a long conversation too.
- I know.

01:14:54.069 --> 01:14:55.949
Things aren't going to
be easy for this couple.

01:14:57.009 --> 01:14:59.755
(The Love QR message Bon Hee sent...)

01:14:59.779 --> 01:15:03.449
(is a framed picture.)

01:15:04.519 --> 01:15:05.919
What color do you like?

01:15:07.449 --> 01:15:10.219
Well, green, I think?
Kind of like a dark green.

01:15:10.289 --> 01:15:11.795
Oh, a dark green.

01:15:11.819 --> 01:15:13.535
(She didn't forget that
Mu Jin likes dark green.)

01:15:13.559 --> 01:15:16.375
Honestly, it's not easy to
remember stuff like that.

01:15:16.399 --> 01:15:17.459
- Right.
- Yes.

01:15:17.829 --> 01:15:22.639
It means that the guy
keeps lingering in her mind.

01:15:23.399 --> 01:15:26.585
(And Ji Won also...)

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.185
(chooses Mu Jin.)

01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:30.709
I chose Mu Jin.

01:15:31.939 --> 01:15:35.779
He sat next to me when I was
sitting in the first-floor living room.

01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:39.789
His gaze was so soft.

01:15:40.419 --> 01:15:41.789
I want to try talking to him.

01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:46.859
(They finish checking the
Love QR Codes amid confusion.)

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:48.905
I can't even imagine

01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:51.835
- what we'll do from tomorrow.
- Are they roommates, perhaps?

01:15:51.859 --> 01:15:54.369
Going on dates for seven days?

01:15:54.469 --> 01:15:56.799
- I haven't been on many dates.
- I can't even imagine.

01:15:57.269 --> 01:15:58.246
Really?

01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:00.070
- Are they?
- They happen to be roommates too.

01:16:02.039 --> 01:16:04.239
Was there someone
who caught your attention?

01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:05.985
(Nodding)

01:16:06.009 --> 01:16:09.319
- Really?
- Just someone I met today...

01:16:10.719 --> 01:16:12.225
- Me too.
- Was there someone?

01:16:12.249 --> 01:16:16.635
There was someone I
wanted to talk to a bit more.

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:17.719
That's good.

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:21.235
- Tomorrow...
- That's much better than

01:16:21.259 --> 01:16:22.799
not being curious about anyone.

01:16:24.099 --> 01:16:26.269
Gosh, it will be awkward
if they're roommates.

01:16:29.469 --> 01:16:31.039
They turned out to be roommates.

01:16:32.469 --> 01:16:34.545
- Do you know what will happen?
- What will happen?

01:16:34.569 --> 01:16:35.809
It becomes so interesting.

01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:38.129
- From the viewer's perspective?
- Yes.

01:16:41.249 --> 01:16:45.249
(Late at night, Mu Jin
gets a text message.)

01:16:46.089 --> 01:16:47.125
(Kim Mu Jin, you've received 2 Love
QR Codes. You get a Love Benefit.)

01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:48.225
A benefit.

01:16:48.249 --> 01:16:49.895
(Kim Mu Jin, you've received 2 Love
QR Codes. You get a Love Benefit.)

01:16:49.919 --> 01:16:51.395
(Check the info of someone you
want to know about in the Secret Room.)

01:16:51.419 --> 01:16:53.659
- The room that was locked earlier.
- The Secret Room?

01:16:53.759 --> 01:16:56.975
Didn't they say they'll get hints
that help you guess someone's age?

01:16:56.999 --> 01:16:59.269
(Mu Jin gets the key to
the Secret Room tonight.)

01:17:12.249 --> 01:17:18.279
(Mu Jin is the first to
check the Secret Room.)

01:17:28.059 --> 01:17:31.175
(Open the drawer and guess the
age of the person you're curious about.)

01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:32.945
(The information you
learn must remain secret.)

01:17:32.969 --> 01:17:34.899
And you have to keep it to yourself?

01:17:36.469 --> 01:17:39.285
Will knowing the age of
someone you're interested in

01:17:39.309 --> 01:17:41.309
be a good thing or a bad thing?

01:17:41.739 --> 01:17:43.379
You actually don't know about that.

01:17:48.179 --> 01:17:52.179
(Who is Mu Jin's heart heading towards?)

01:17:57.819 --> 01:17:59.435
- Is that how it ends?
- What? Right here?

01:17:59.459 --> 01:18:01.435
(Is this the end?)

01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:03.159
Gosh, dating shows are always like this.

01:18:03.859 --> 01:18:05.579
I know because I've experienced this a lot.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:08.576
Yes.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.075
(Meanwhile, in Hyeon Jun
and Sang Hyeon's room)

01:18:10.099 --> 01:18:13.609
Hyeon Jun, you're also not good at
actively approaching someone, right?

01:18:14.409 --> 01:18:16.289
I'm not good at it if
there are lots of people.

01:18:16.809 --> 01:18:17.839
I see.

01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:24.279
But when it's just me and
her, I think I'm better at it.

01:18:24.579 --> 01:18:27.549
But are you confident that you
can get someone alone with you?

01:18:28.119 --> 01:18:29.119
No.

01:18:29.889 --> 01:18:32.689
I just felt like you and I
have similar personalities.

01:18:33.329 --> 01:18:34.989
Kind of introverted...

01:18:35.089 --> 01:18:37.629
So, you're an INFP. I'm an INFJ.

01:18:39.269 --> 01:18:41.499
- Just the J and P are different.
- I know.

01:18:44.369 --> 01:18:46.469
I hope there isn't any competition.

01:18:47.969 --> 01:18:49.339
That's too grand a dream, right?

01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:54.555
- Suddenly doing push-ups?
- Suddenly?

01:18:54.579 --> 01:18:55.619
(Suddenly doing push-ups?)

01:18:55.979 --> 01:18:57.695
How much competition
is he going to get into?

01:18:57.719 --> 01:19:00.789
(Is he doing strength training
for tomorrow's competition?)

01:19:02.719 --> 01:19:03.965
Oh, man.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.095
(The younger guy doesn't like
competition but prepares for it.)

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:07.429
He's seriously here to
compete against himself.

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:12.969
(He even works out in the
outdoor gym in the rain.)

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:16.515
(Huffing and puffing)

01:19:16.539 --> 01:19:18.745
(Will there really be no competition
as Sang Hyeon hoped for?)

01:19:18.769 --> 01:19:22.169
(Men, please ask someone
out on a date within 5 minutes.)

01:19:22.509 --> 01:19:24.515
(The younger men stand up
right away without any hesitation.)

01:19:24.539 --> 01:19:25.859
(Would you like to go on a date?)

01:19:25.979 --> 01:19:28.179
(Do you want to go out on a date today?)

01:19:28.679 --> 01:19:29.679
(I'd like that.)

01:19:30.119 --> 01:19:32.049
(Why did you choose me?)

01:19:32.419 --> 01:19:34.289
(You're so pretty.)

01:19:34.519 --> 01:19:35.859
(I'll help you.)

01:19:36.019 --> 01:19:37.865
(A sense of giddiness is
reawakened for the first time in a while.)

01:19:37.889 --> 01:19:39.835
(Older women aren't all that bad.)

01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:41.959
(Is this what dating an
older woman is like?)

01:19:42.499 --> 01:19:43.699
(You're so adorable.)

01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:49.175
(How many women do you
want to get to know more?)

01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:52.469
(Let's put the serious conversation
aside for now and just eat.)

01:19:52.569 --> 01:19:55.185
(I just didn't feel all that great.)

01:19:55.209 --> 01:19:58.439
(I couldn't hide my emotions,
so I had a lot on my mind.)

01:19:59.209 --> 01:20:00.209
I don't know.

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.550
