You're such a good talker.

00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:31.203
What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.408
A swindler.

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:34.244
What?

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:37.633
I'll become the best swindler
and make tons of money.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.729
More money than you could imagine.

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.280
A swindler is a bad person.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.364
How are we any different

00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:51.511
from the people who live there?

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:54.787
I don't just want to be a swindler

00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:56.950
for the money.

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.352
If I become the best,

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:03.528
I can live a fake life as if it's real.

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:07.850 line:20%

Liar.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:10.757
You switch to sign language

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:12.265
whenever you want to swear at me.

00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:14.306
- No.
- You know what?

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.324
Starting today, teach me sign language.

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:18.504
Well...

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:22.508
only if you make the ride home fun.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.581
Deal.

00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:28.160
Hold on tight.

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:30.780
- Wow.
- I'll go fast.

00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:18.049 line:20%


00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.660 line:20%
Wait!

00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:24.178 line:20%
Sir! Wait! Stop!

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:27.261 line:20%
Seriously, sir!
Do you even know who I am?

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:28.617 line:20%
Seriously.

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:29.658 line:20%
You have no idea.

00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:31.927 line:20%
Here!

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.906 line:20%
I have diabetes.

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:41.748 line:20%
You have to let patients slide
when their blood sugar drops.

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:43.563 line:20%
The ticket.

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:47.806 line:20%

Please take it. Thank you.

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:49.570 line:20%
I almost forgot.

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:53.783 line:20%
As a thank you for your service,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.072 line:20%
here's a little something
within the Anti-Bribery Act,

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.493 line:20%
from the bottom of my heart.

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:04.125 line:20%


00:03:18.894 --> 00:03:20.490
What's this?

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:22.835
My goodness!

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:25.589
If it isn't the great Unit Chief Han?

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:27.384
How gracious of you to call
a lowly scoundrel

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.306
who snoops around
the Myeongdong loan sharks.

00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:33.898
If I weren't driving,
I would answer with both hands.

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:35.651
I'm sorry, I'm on Bluetooth.

00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:37.849
Please cut the silly act.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.671
A counterfeit bill has been reported.

00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:41.894
You should go since you're always free.

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:43.750
What?

00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:46.007
A counterfeit bill?

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.917 line:20%


00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:49.572 line:20%


00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.750
Hey,
Violent Crimes Unit!

00:03:55.817 --> 00:03:58.606
You guys stay out for now!

00:03:58.673 --> 00:03:59.813
Buddy.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.210
Are you in menopause?
Why are you so grumpy?

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.126
You reek of alcohol.

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:08.365
Hey, it's a tiny alley.

00:04:08.432 --> 00:04:10.514
Just bear with us
until my boss gets here.

00:04:10.581 --> 00:04:12.549
You know what he's like.

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:15.781
Okay, fine. Are you done?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.512
Gosh.

00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:23.462
Make way.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.108
Make way!

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.085 line:20%


00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:45.822 line:20%
Seoul City Violent Crimes Unit Chief,
Jang Junghyuk)

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:47.714
Hey.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.990
I got an ID
from his wallet.

00:04:58.057 --> 00:04:59.555
What was the name?

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.490
- I know him.
- You do?

00:05:03.943 --> 00:05:05.330
Anything special?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.856
This was in his mouth.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.851
I needed some cash,

00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:31.634
so I kept it in my safe.

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:35.551
It's not fake money, right?

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.318
Wasn't it just a prank call?

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:41.509
Do you think

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:44.296
someone would prank call the NIS for fun?

00:05:44.363 --> 00:05:46.707
I guess not. I knew it.

00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:49.325
- He only ordered expensive wine.
- Gosh.

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:51.428
He had no problem
paying millions of won in cash.

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:53.345
I should have known right then.

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:00.547
Is this real cash?

00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:01.981
Is it real?

00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.486 line:20%


00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:16.783 line:20%


00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:18.481 line:20%
Wow.

00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:21.781
Who does this art belong to?

00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:24.769
It passed the detector,
infrared machine,

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:27.665
and even the chemical response test.

00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:29.039
On top of that,

00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:30.965
an intaglio printer was used.

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:32.512
So, it's a supernote?

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.851
It took two weeks to check one bill.

00:06:34.918 --> 00:06:37.045 line:20%

It's 100% a supernote.

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:41.052
There's no time to waste. Thanks.

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:42.563
Wait.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.966
Do you remember this fake
hundred-dollar bill?

00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:54.440
From the casino case
five years ago?

00:06:54.507 --> 00:06:55.905
Yes.

00:06:55.972 --> 00:06:58.740
The guy who was shot in Jongno two weeks ago

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:00.513
had this in his mouth.

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:02.466
It wasn't made with an intaglio printer,

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:04.597
but it had perfect
anti-counterfeit devices.

00:07:04.664 --> 00:07:07.260
Unless you're an expert,
it would be hard to believe

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:10.174
it's a fake and request an examination.

00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:12.134
Who requested it?

00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:15.432
It was a
Seoul City Police Chief. His name was...

00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:19.796
Jang Junghyuk, I think?

00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:25.714
Something smells fishy.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:27.549
Do you know him?

00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:08.225
Can he prove himself tonight?

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:11.508
We've been waiting
for these two men to fight.

00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:15.962
Who will hit the jackpot tonight?

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:19.610
It's the main event,
the grand finale of today's match.

00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:22.452
The fighters may enter!

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.883
Yeah!

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.332
You know I love an uppercut,
right?

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.041
Sir,

00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:35.027
is the crackdown next week?

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:35.945
Yes, sir.

00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:39.164
When the match is over,
make sure the customers know.

00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:42.018
It's been too peaceful lately.

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:44.369
It's all thanks to our big boss.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.186
That's right.

00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:49.897
Our big boss is gatekeeping.
Nothing can go wrong.

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:53.512
Place your bets on the fighter
of your choice.

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:56.148
It's your last chance to become rich.

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.973
"It's Surprise Time!"

00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:08.083
They say a thug's life
is a constant rise and fall.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.489
The ebbs and flows,
between a rock and a hard place,

00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:13.181
hanging on by a thread,
every call is a close call,

00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:16.192
"Stern and drag" all the way.

00:09:23.456 --> 00:09:26.438
Sir, I think you mean,
"Sturm und Drang."

00:09:29.188 --> 00:09:30.121
I apologize.

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:31.310
They say,

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.469
if some asshole cuts you off,

00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:35.168
you should yank his tongue out,

00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:36.718
you piece of shit.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.297
I apologize. I take it back.

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:39.489
Sister!

00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:41.820 line:20%


00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.199
My brother!

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:45.539
Nice to see you.

00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:46.563
You're a big shot.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.245
You're a big shot now.

00:09:48.312 --> 00:09:49.838
Did you do something?
You look prettier.

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:51.739
I always look pretty.

00:09:51.806 --> 00:09:53.035
- I'll pour you one.
- Okay.

00:09:53.102 --> 00:09:54.807
One second.

00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:59.499
I'm getting a call.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:01.509
Gosh, make it quick.

00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:05.007
Yes, sir?

00:10:11.893 --> 00:10:13.305
Understood.

00:10:13.372 --> 00:10:14.671
Okay.

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:21.636
Be careful.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.331
I got her.

00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:46.844
- Junggi.
- Yes, sir?

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:48.807
Give me the thing.

00:11:06.182 --> 00:11:07.504
Did you win some?

00:11:08.148 --> 00:11:09.518
Well...

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:10.880
I lost everything.

00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:27.213 line:20%


00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:53.013
Get off.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.302
Make it spotless
after the match.

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.339
I'll stand by outside, sir.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:04.095
I'm not some ringleader
lining up his henchmen.

00:12:33.124 --> 00:12:34.262
Good stuff.

00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:36.928
Here.

00:12:39.128 --> 00:12:41.490
Mister Big Shot.

00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.803 line:20%

In 1989, at Manila Bank in the Philippines,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.276
millions of hundred-dollar bills
were found.

00:13:18.343 --> 00:13:20.545
The US government was furious.

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.088
At the time, it was impossible
to tell what was real.

00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:26.637
The bills were deemed exact replicas.

00:13:26.704 --> 00:13:28.395
The US named the fake bill

00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:30.079
the "supernote."

00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:31.326
Hold on.

00:13:32.468 --> 00:13:33.863
Are you saying

00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:36.072
this 50,000 won bill is a supernote?

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:37.043
Yes.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.494
On what grounds?

00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:44.234
Both the American dollar
and this Korean won

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.273
have been printed by an intaglio printer.

00:13:47.775 --> 00:13:50.704
Those printers are safeguarded
by the governments around the world.

00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.612
The designs are also kept
thoroughly confidential.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:56.372
How in the hell
was an intaglio printer used?

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:57.830
Seven years ago, North Korea

00:13:57.897 --> 00:14:00.546
gave us intel about
a missing printer design.

00:14:00.613 --> 00:14:03.402
If it were smuggled in,
it's not entirely impossible.

00:14:03.878 --> 00:14:05.297
Is there anyone you suspect?

00:14:06.194 --> 00:14:07.621
The guy who made this.

00:14:08.438 --> 00:14:12.581
Do you remember we found 30 million
dollars in fake bills at a casino?

00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:14.163
The hundred-dollar bill
from that time,

00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:18.862
and this bill that was found two weeks ago
at the crime scene in Jongno,

00:14:20.002 --> 00:14:21.366
are matching counterfeits.

00:14:23.824 --> 00:14:25.587
Evidently,

00:14:26.142 --> 00:14:28.384
on the day the fake
fifty-thousand won bill was reported,

00:14:28.926 --> 00:14:29.947
the gun was fired.

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:33.100
The dead man was found
with this bill in his mouth

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:34.523
on the exact same day.

00:14:35.234 --> 00:14:37.909
In conclusion,
the casino fake bill

00:14:37.976 --> 00:14:39.880
and this supernote may have been made

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.720
by the same guy.

00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:47.962
As the Financial Crimes
Unit Chief...

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:49.323
The same guy...

00:14:52.757 --> 00:14:53.969
Here.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:58.230
These are from the security camera
at the wine bar that reported the bill.

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:01.867
The guy in the photos

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:05.284
is the casino mastermind, J.

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:09.107
If J got his hands on
an intaglio printer,

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:11.260
this fake hundred-dollar bill

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.131
has to be a message from J.

00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:21.004
The mastermind behind Korea's biggest
counterfeit case in the last five years

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.961
returned with a supernote?

00:15:24.028 --> 00:15:25.052
Yes.

00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:30.631
You two team up
and get to the bottom of this.

00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.548
Wait, sir.

00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:35.042
Counterfeit cases are exclusive
to the Financial Crimes Unit.

00:15:35.109 --> 00:15:36.858
Gitae is the expert in the field,

00:15:37.377 --> 00:15:39.502
and he also lost J before.

00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:41.580
After working like a madman
for years to catch J,

00:15:42.244 --> 00:15:43.289
Gitae has a lot of intel.

00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:45.940
Gitae just monitors loan sharks.

00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:48.152
- This is an important case...
- In sports,

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:51.583
they have a coach and a head coach.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.869
We can apply it here.

00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:54.301
Gitae can run the operation.

00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:55.979
He'll report back to you, Yongsan.

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:57.748
Let's go with that.

00:16:00.257 --> 00:16:02.017
This is a critical situation.

00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:03.299
Yes, sir.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.993
Gosh.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.798
After being surrounded by loan sharks,

00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:19.165
you learned how to lay it on thick.

00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:20.801
You got him right where it tickled.

00:16:21.282 --> 00:16:22.984
You had the deputy
hanging on your every word.

00:16:23.606 --> 00:16:24.711
Isn't that right?

00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:27.937
Was I that good?

00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:29.200
Thank you.

00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.295
Damn it.

00:16:32.403 --> 00:16:33.976
- You got this by luck.
- What?

00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:36.820
I know you want to make this big
for your comeback.

00:16:37.722 --> 00:16:39.760
Let's see if it goes to plan.

00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:42.632
I wasn't the director of the NIS.

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:45.335
Why would I drool over
a unit chief position?

00:16:46.858 --> 00:16:49.019
Don't worry.

00:16:49.515 --> 00:16:51.916
I don't lose sleep over

00:16:53.324 --> 00:16:55.609
a tiny position like that.
See you later.

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:32.979
Yes?

00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:34.781
To where?

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:38.504
Okay, I'll be there.

00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:44.274 line:20%

We had picked that day as D-Day,

00:17:44.341 --> 00:17:45.747 line:20%
but the guy suddenly died.

00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:47.806
We're in a tough situation too.

00:17:47.873 --> 00:17:49.460
When you say "D-Day,"

00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:51.876
are you talking about the crackdown?

00:17:52.392 --> 00:17:53.628
Yes.

00:17:58.376 --> 00:17:59.808
Watch it!

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:42.631
Everyone is after the thing, saying it's killer.

00:18:42.698 --> 00:18:44.147
Can't we get some?

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:47.404
The manufacturer isn't into
domestic distribution.

00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:49.197
So?

00:18:49.264 --> 00:18:51.258
It's not available in Korea?

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.999
They only take orders
of over 50 billion won.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:56.556 line:20%


00:18:56.813 --> 00:18:58.683
What? Fifty billion?

00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:03.587
I get that it's great,
but he must be crazy.

00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:05.152
Crazy?

00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:07.849
I was able to get to the top,

00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:10.551
all thanks to the chairman's groundwork.

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:13.571
The smart college,
the one that's far away.

00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:16.028
He has a few chemistry graduates.

00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:20.757
He kept researching to make
the sample a dose of brilliance.

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:23.479
If you know them that well,

00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:25.335
you could have gotten your hands dirty.

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:26.618
Of course, I did.

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:32.332
Sir,

00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:33.928
have you heard

00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:35.421
- of the name, J?
- J?

00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:37.368
Right.

00:19:37.435 --> 00:19:39.389
The one that people have only heard about

00:19:39.456 --> 00:19:42.236
but never seen? That J?

00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:44.794
J?

00:19:45.363 --> 00:19:46.254
Yes.

00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:48.280
Yes, why?

00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:50.956
Is he offering us seed money?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.149
J is willing to

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.046
invest 50 billion won into the drug.

00:19:58.813 --> 00:19:59.724
So?

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:02.952
Through this Fixer guy,
J said he'll show up

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:06.281
with 2.5 billion won as an advance.

00:20:06.348 --> 00:20:09.062
Was he laundering fake bills
with drugs?

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:23.523
Gosh.

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:27.402
It's a big group. I'm scared.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.553
Let's go.

00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:45.128
Ta-da!

00:20:52.012 --> 00:20:53.847
J must be sitting inside.

00:20:53.914 --> 00:20:56.488
Tell him we should sign and get started.

00:20:57.796 --> 00:21:02.560
We don't know each other
well enough for you to ask for favors.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.413
My boss

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.407
is a discreet man.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.929
Tell your boss that he doesn't rush.

00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:11.089
My boss will let you know where later.

00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:13.623
One second.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.714
One second.

00:21:15.838 --> 00:21:18.352
I'm usually discreet.

00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:24.892
Behind a counterfeit case,

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:28.179
who knows if all the money is
real or fake?

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:31.213
We'll have to examine them first.
Don't you think?

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.508
What a pain.

00:21:38.624 --> 00:21:40.282
Here.

00:21:40.349 --> 00:21:42.087
On the day J and Dosik were
supposed to sign the contract,

00:21:42.154 --> 00:21:45.905
they changed the location,
and we lost Dosik in Jongno.

00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:48.460
Bang after bang...

00:21:48.527 --> 00:21:50.084
Bang.

00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:51.987
Who knew he would be caught dead?

00:21:52.054 --> 00:21:54.297
Where did J and Fixer meet

00:21:54.364 --> 00:21:56.472
Choi Dosik with the 2.5 billion won?

00:21:56.539 --> 00:21:59.857
A dock near the warehouse complex
in Incheon Port.

00:22:08.836 --> 00:22:11.074
I found J's hideout.

00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.534
He's still using the one he set up
for the fake dollars five years ago.

00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:16.569
Come to the Incheon container dock
with the guys.

00:22:17.178 --> 00:22:19.340
I'll meet you there,
and we'll bust his hideout.

00:22:19.407 --> 00:22:21.218
Are you ordering me right now?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.193
I am reporting.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.414
Do you hear me?

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:30.772
Be careful on your way here with the guys.

00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:33.349
I'm asking you nicely,

00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:34.809
Unit Chief Han Yongsan, sir!

00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:41.824
Here we go!

00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:04.246
Guys,

00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:05.803
we're heading out to Incheon.

00:23:19.052 --> 00:23:20.200
Everyone, listen up.

00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:22.333
Stay alert.

00:23:22.822 --> 00:23:24.751
He can vanish in an instant.

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:26.018
Yes, sir.

00:23:26.085 --> 00:23:27.495
Let's just see

00:23:27.562 --> 00:23:28.653
how incredible

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.449
this J guy is.

00:24:53.432 --> 00:24:55.360
Look at that.

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:58.732
Is this his grand comeback
after five years?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.963
Right?

00:25:05.077 --> 00:25:06.361
That scared me!

00:25:08.184 --> 00:25:09.740
Jeez, that was crazy.

00:25:12.414 --> 00:25:13.998
He was just here.

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:16.913
Go.

00:25:45.986 --> 00:25:47.216
I mean,

00:25:47.283 --> 00:25:48.366
based on the evidence of his hideout,

00:25:48.433 --> 00:25:51.688
you just assumed the supernote
was made in the warehouse.

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:53.288
That's...

00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:55.352
Isn't that reckless rather than bold?

00:25:56.845 --> 00:25:57.939
Isn't it?

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.778
Wait...

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:32.598
Yungyu.

00:27:34.114 --> 00:27:36.506
- Who...
- It is Park Yungyu, right?

00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:38.361
It's me, Jung Sanggi.

00:27:38.428 --> 00:27:40.110
Well, I don't recall...

00:27:40.177 --> 00:27:41.768
Gosh, how are you?

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:01.399
Let's go.

00:28:28.571 --> 00:28:30.483
Suhyun, I heard you almost died.

00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:32.726
Right?

00:28:33.887 --> 00:28:35.150
Gosh.

00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:39.245
You don't seem like you almost died.

00:28:39.312 --> 00:28:41.317
You're alive and kicking.

00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:44.282
By the way,

00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:48.605
I was demoted five years ago
because of you.

00:28:48.672 --> 00:28:50.676
You look even younger now.

00:28:50.743 --> 00:28:51.858
Never mind.

00:28:51.925 --> 00:28:53.983
Stop beating around the bush,
and cut to the chase.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.882
Listen to yourself.

00:28:55.949 --> 00:28:57.388
Get off your high horse.

00:28:57.455 --> 00:29:00.399
No wonder containers fall from the sky.

00:29:03.257 --> 00:29:04.562
Jeez.

00:29:07.148 --> 00:29:09.010
What have you been up to?

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:11.983
That's not
what you should be asking.

00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:15.140
You should ask me who I met.

00:29:17.494 --> 00:29:18.916
Did you meet that bastard?

00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:22.804
Yes.

00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:24.784
J.

00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:28.617
He's back.

00:29:29.357 --> 00:29:30.701
I knew it.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.816
Two weeks ago,
a case of a supernote was reported.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.381
On that very day,

00:29:38.448 --> 00:29:41.481
one of the fake hundred-dollar bills
you made five years ago was found.

00:29:42.776 --> 00:29:44.053
Also, today,

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.422
I didn't even have to call you in.

00:29:47.449 --> 00:29:49.148
Is this a coincidence?

00:29:49.215 --> 00:29:52.298
Everyone related to the counterfeit case
from five years ago

00:29:52.365 --> 00:29:54.848
is surfacing one by one.

00:29:55.852 --> 00:29:57.060
Me.

00:29:57.127 --> 00:29:58.239
You.

00:29:58.306 --> 00:29:59.589
J.

00:30:00.317 --> 00:30:01.555
Jang Junghyuk.

00:30:01.622 --> 00:30:03.393
And Choi Dosik, who is dead.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.982
Yes, Choi Dosik.

00:30:06.764 --> 00:30:08.817
It has to be whoever

00:30:09.344 --> 00:30:12.462
put the hundred-dollar bill
in Dosik's mouth.

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:19.655
I never disclosed
that it's Choi Dosik,

00:30:19.722 --> 00:30:21.352
nor did I tell you where
the hundred-dollar bill was found.

00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:25.943
How did you find out?

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:31.267
I know too much.

00:30:31.798 --> 00:30:33.479
That's why I have to die.

00:30:37.365 --> 00:30:39.655
What the hell is going on?

00:30:42.282 --> 00:30:43.582
There's a person!

00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:45.493
Call 911!

00:30:46.254 --> 00:30:47.481
Excuse me.

00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:48.985
Are you okay?

00:30:49.052 --> 00:30:50.782
After escaping death,

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:52.184
I wanted to live,

00:30:53.222 --> 00:30:55.005
so I came to you.

00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:58.519
This seems to be the only safe place.

00:30:58.586 --> 00:31:00.753
Your fake hundred-dollar bill
from five years ago

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.041
was so impeccably made.

00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:05.491
I see you've mastered
the 50,000 won bill too.

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:08.502
Did you work together with J on this?

00:31:12.207 --> 00:31:13.292
That's right.

00:31:14.037 --> 00:31:15.542
It's my work.

00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:16.924
Amazing.

00:31:18.783 --> 00:31:21.680
I thought as much.

00:31:22.921 --> 00:31:24.295
The whole time you were in prison,

00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:27.242
you were just biding your time,
waiting to get revenge for Master Yang.

00:31:31.883 --> 00:31:33.220
Han Suhyun,

00:31:35.497 --> 00:31:37.756
how did the supernote start,

00:31:38.352 --> 00:31:39.774
and how far has it progressed?

00:31:40.717 --> 00:31:41.889
And if I tell you?

00:31:44.925 --> 00:31:46.693
If I tell you, will you protect me?

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.291
Will you keep me alive?

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.768
Of course.

00:31:51.835 --> 00:31:53.842
It's the duty of a national agency.

00:31:54.332 --> 00:31:55.628
But what if

00:31:56.997 --> 00:31:58.619
it's like five years ago?

00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:05.459
It doesn't matter.

00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:07.779
Even if history repeats itself,

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.935
the only person I can trust

00:32:11.514 --> 00:32:13.305
is you, Mr. Cha.

00:32:15.424 --> 00:32:16.728
I'll tell you

00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:18.651
everything.

00:33:05.424 --> 00:33:08.378
It's about damn time we started...

00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:12.271
the supernote game.
