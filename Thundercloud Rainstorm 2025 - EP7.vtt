Threatened?

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.570
It has nothing to do with Jeonghan.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.760
Really.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.270
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.920
Please.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.690
What are you talking about?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.210
I don't care if you really know.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.640
As long as you stay by his side,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.390
he will be miserable forever.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.780
Let's go.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.750
Okay?

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.070
The elevator door is closing.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.730
Don't you know
that Iljo is being threatened?

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.960
Is it really none of your business?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.110
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.530
Seo Jeongin...

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.980
Oh, my cousin.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.640
What brings you here?

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.770
Are you going to punch me again?

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.720
Do you have drugs?

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.470
Drugs?

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.190
You want some?

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.740
Yes.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.460
What would you like?

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.520
Ecstasy, cocaine, or...

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.000
Xanax?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.690
Wait.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.720
Where were the drugs again?

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.480
Why do you suddenly want them?

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.300
Ah...

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.550
Lee Iljo?

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.650
But he doesn't take drugs.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.010
He wouldn't take it
even when I put it in his mouth.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.040
He never gives in to me.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.000
Ice.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.770
Found it.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.470
Is this enough?

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.500
Sure.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.920
I'll give you a cousin price.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.640
Thank you.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.750
But,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.320
let me know
if you successfully make Iljo take drugs

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.660
so that I can have a go at him, too.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.960
No.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.840
How about a threesome?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.220
Let's make it four,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.380
with that tall guy.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.380
Lee Iljo does look like a fox.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.180
Goodness.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.420
What are these?

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.730
Oh, these?

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.620
I never thought of spreading these photos.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.470
Well, Lee Iljo refused to
return Dad's house.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.700
I asked the property agency,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.100
and apparently the place is going to be
redeveloped soon—for a lot of money.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.860
I had nothing to threaten

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.990
this guy who has nothing with.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.710
And that's when you appeared.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.970
Looking at the way he looked at you,

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.340
I thought, there we go.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.520
That dude doesn't even flinch
when he's getting beaten up.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.650
But he...

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.300
"Please... delete this."

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.840
"Just a few days—can you give me
a few days to think?"

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.590
"Can you destroy these photos?"

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.710
Isn't it funny?

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.140
Right.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.740
Thank you for the drugs.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.350
I'm the one who's more thankful.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.910
I'm going.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.760
Crazy bastard.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.390
Hello?

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.850
Is this the police station?

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.110
Seo Jeongin, that bastard!

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.370
That crazy jerk really took many photos.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.740
You let yourself get beaten up

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.090
just for these stupid photos?

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.290
When are you coming back?

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:36.070
[Iljo! Take care and stay healthy.
-Mr. Maro from Yedeun Orphanage]

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.470
Yedeun Orphanage.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.420
[In the next episode]

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.710
In other words,

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.900
he's from your orphanage, right?

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.270
It's all because of you
that Iljo is having a hard time.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.130
I heard you haven't seen each other
for over a month.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.770
Please stay with me.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.650
It'll take a very, very

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.210
long time.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.680
Do you have to go this far?

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.280
I...

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.820
want to have your future.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.690
What if

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.630
he doesn't show up there?
