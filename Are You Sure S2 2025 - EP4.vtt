00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.299
-[director] Wrong!
-You failed.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.634
Yes, understood.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.736
-Let's study capitals.
-Can't help it.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.739
We gave away one win so easily.

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.741
-[director] The last game is...
-Yes.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.110
...rock-paper-scissors minus one.

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:53.179
EXPLANATION
1. EACH MEMBER ONE HAND, STAFF TWO HANDS

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.949
2. TEAM THAT WINS MINUS ONE, WINS

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.784
What if we throw together?

00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:59.185
Let's signal like this.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.389
But if we signal,
they'll know who's throwing.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.157
So subtly, you feel it?

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:05.225
BOUNCING

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.127
-You feel it?
-I feel it too.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.728
-But this is...
-Really?

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:09.796
You feel it too?

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.698
The person who signals throws.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.099
-Right.
-Right.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.902
-Should we try a practice round?
-Just one round.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.171
-The one who signals throws.
-Yeah.

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.840
Rock-paper-scissors, minus one.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.575
Why aren't you signaling?

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.311
Why didn't you do it?

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.179
Why didn't you signal?

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:28.081
-Oh, right.
-Both threw scissors.

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:30.083
-[Jung Kook] Wait.
-Okay, best of three.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.118
-This is hard.
-[director] Best of three.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.188
-We'll accept all of that.
-Understood.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.024
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.026
PAPER, PAPER
ROCK, SCISSORS

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.294
Minus one.

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.862
PAPER, SCISSORS

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.765
-We can play the same kind.
-Hey.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:50.136
I'll play rock first, so you play paper.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.204
Okay.

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:54.007
One does it in order,
the other does it in reverse order.

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.608
You decided to do it this way?

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.743
HOW DID HE KNOW?

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.578
Maybe he heard it through your mic?

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.482
-Here we go.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.150
Minus one.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.953
ROCK RETRIEVED
ONLY SCISSORS LEFT

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.154
SECOND MATCH: STAFF WINS

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.789
No, maybe you were right.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:10.991
You didn't signal.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.092
Let's go.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.629
-Did we lose twice?
-You thought we won?

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.798
Did we lose both rounds?

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.334
-Should we start the game now?
-Five rounds.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.703
-It's best of five.
-Best of five.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.605
-[director] Best of five.
-Best of five.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.273
-For real now?
-From the start?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.109
-From the start.
-For real?

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.844
You signal, I throw, okay?

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.779
-Okay.
-Fair and square.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.015
Here we go. The first round.

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.083
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.184
Minus one.

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.186
ROCK
TIE

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.155
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:43.223
Minus one.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.425
SECOND MATCH: JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK WIN

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.694
-That's it. Good.
-How was the signal?

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:48.962
But you were a bit slow.

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.032
-A bit slow.
-I needed to see and judge.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.466
RIDING MOMENTUM TO NEXT ROUND

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.667
Minus one.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.204
ROCK, ROCK, PAPER

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.739
[in English] Okay, okay.

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.674
-[in Korean] It's okay.
-I was being dumb.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.510
[director] Okay, it's one to one.

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:04.944
[Jimin] I'll only play rock.

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:08.915
-Okay.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.350
Minus one.

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.451
How did they know?

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.087
Did they see it? I should be careful.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:16.156
Paper, rock.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.525
-Rock ties.
-[Jimin] Definitely wins.

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.493
We obviously wouldn't throw paper.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.229
Wow. You're pretty smart.

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.664
You should've thrown then.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.332
Right, exactly.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.435
-I need to think of me.
-It's one to one.

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.669
[director] Two to one.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:30.737
Who's two?

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.007
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.208
Minus one.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.342
Nice.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.477
Minus one.

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:38.678
PAPER
ROCK

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.146
Okay, it's two to two.

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:42.482
Whoever wins first wins, right?

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:43.583
Yes.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.318
-[in English] Last game.
-Here we go.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.320
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.222
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.126
JUNG KOOK, IT'S YOU

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:56.563
-Minus one.
-[in Korean] Okay, tied.

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.566
Play scissors this time.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.669
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.904
-Minus one.
-What, did you let us win?

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.407
-It's no fun if they go easy on us.
-Why?

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:09.109
This is so much fun.

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.011
Should we do it for real? Final round.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.346
That's how you end it.

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.315
Sure. They've been nice enough.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.483
What will you play?

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:17.917
Tell me what you want to.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.453
-Without signaling this time?
-Let's do it seriously.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.655
-No signal? Okay.
-No signal? None.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.390
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.993
IT'S OBVIOUS ALREADY

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.228
What should we throw?

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:31.064
Minus one.

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.966
[both exclaiming]

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.100
Let's just go!

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.069
I'm too shy to do this.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:39.973
Let's go. It's just a ten-minute walk.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.274
[Jung Kook] Okay, let's go.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.610
-We accept defeat.
-It should be fair.

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.678
[Jung Kook] Good game. Get some rest.

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:48.248
-You worked hard today.
-[Jimin] Let's do that.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.683
[Jung Kook] Let's see.
The mart is this way.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.552
What do you want to eat?

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.554
[Jimin] Let's think about it
as we walk.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:58.458
-What do you feel like eating?
-Probably just meat or noodles?

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:01.561
-[Jimin] I wonder how big the mart is.
-Right.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:04.931
-It's nice to step out in the evening.
-It's pretty.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.900
-It does feel free.
-Yeah.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.268
[Jimin] It's pretty.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.270
[Jimin] There sure are lots of tourists.

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:13.540
[Jung Kook] Where's the mart?

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.411
[Jimin] I think it's here. Seems like it.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.079
[Jung Kook] That's right.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.581
ARRIVED AT MART

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.949
[Jimin] Do you have a coin?

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.185
GETTING SHOPPING CART

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.819
[Jung Kook] I have a coin. Wait.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.855
HEARING SOMEONE SPEAK KOREAN

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.490
TURNING

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.158
[Jimin] Nice to hear Korean.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.362
ENTERING MART

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:39.399
WHICH SECTION ARE THEY GOING TO FIRST?

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.801
[Jung Kook] Isn't this like pork ribs?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.902
We have an oven.

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.604
[Jimin] This looks more delicious.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.907
MORE EXPENSIVE MIGHT BE TASTIER

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.209
Good, good.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.578
OFF TO GET NEXT INGREDIENT

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.413
-[in English] Excuse me?
-[woman] Yeah.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.714
Where is rice?

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:56.883
-Rice?
-Rice, yeah.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.218
Rice.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.187
Okay, thank you.

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:03.089
[Jimin in Korean] Let's try
making rice.

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.691
I should make something too.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.126
But we don't have a rice cooker.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.494
Pot rice.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.264
LOOKING UP POT RICE

00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:12.465
It's quite easy.

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:15.268
One kilo will be...
It should be enough, right?

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:18.104
I'm not confident,
but I should give it a try.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.305
WHILE JIMIN PICKS RICE

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:21.107
JUNG COOK'S TASK:
BACON DONE

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:24.210
JUNG COOK'S TASK 2:
SALT AND PEPPER DONE

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:29.048
JUNG COOK'S TASK 3:
PASTA DONE

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.317
WAIT

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:34.721
PASTA PURCHASE COMPLETE FOR REAL

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.156
[in Korean] Where did Jimin go?

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.258
[Jimin] Jung Kook.

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.994
-I'll make rice today.
-Oh, really?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.764
I got some extra meat, too,
in case we decide to make pasta.

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:48.201
[Jimin] I see. If you could make it,
that'd be great.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.503
I learned how to make pot rice.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.005
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.
-I'll try it.

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:55.742
-Okay, give it a try.
-I got a kilo since it's not just for us.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.244
I want to buy just half
of these mushrooms.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.047
-We have lots of money.
-[Jimin] We're rich.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.115
MUSHROOM

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.316
Hey, hold on.

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:04.517
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah.

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:07.020
-There's triangle kimbap.
-What?

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:09.989
[Jimin] Shopping for food
is making me hungry.

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:12.925
This looks like a lot, though.

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:14.694
-Is it okay?
-Throw it in.

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.195
We can take it back later.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.397
[Jimin] Isn't it 80?

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.299
-[Jung Kook] It's 81.
-Enough, enough.

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:24.804
-[Jimin] How much is it?
-It's 68.

00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:25.938
-It's 68?
-Yeah.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:28.775
GROCERIES: 68 FRANCS IN TOTAL

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.210
[Jung Kook in English] Thank you.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.512
[in English] Receipt, yes.

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:34.180
[Jimin] Let's enjoy our meal today.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.717
How about we sit down
and have kimbap first?

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:38.785
-Right here?
-Yeah.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.320
[Jung Kook] But can we sit here?

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:41.654
-We just sit?
-[Jimin] Yes.

00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:43.389
[Jung Kook] Let's have some kimbap.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.759
-[Jimin] It's raining.
-I know.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.495
[Jimin] We might get rained on.

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.931
HUNGER THAT RAIN CAN'T STOP

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.403
STREET KIMBAP TIME

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.407
EATING FIRST

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:02.775
[Jung Kook] What flavor?

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.581
What is it?

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.620
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.389
-Spicy tuna?
-Yeah.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:19.726
It's good.

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:26.466
HUNGER IS THE BEST SEASONING

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:35.208
ADJUSTING CAMERA

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:42.949
DEVOURING TRIANGLE KIMBAP

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.055
Let's go.

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:53.292
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.360
[Jimin] Let's go.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.296
[Jimin] We spent a lot of time
at the mart.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.799
Let's put the meat in the oven
as soon as we're home.

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:01.934
-[Jimin] How long will that take?
-Two hours.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.002
[Jimin] Hmm.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.071
-Should I make rice or not?
-Rice?

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.073
Let's just keep it for now.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.109
-We'll decide what to have, rice or pasta.
-[Jimin] Okay.

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:11.911
[Jung Kook] I'll make the meat.

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:13.446
[Jimin] Should I make pasta?

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:14.514
What?

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.117
It's so peaceful.

00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:19.519
[Jung Kook] It's a chicken.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.953
[makes clucking sounds]

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:24.924
[Jung Kook] The Matterhorn.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.226
That angle looks prettiest right now.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.596
ANOTHER VIEW OF THE MATTERHORN
ON THEIR WAY HOME

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.399
[Jung Kook] It's still weird
being out of the military.

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:36.302
[Jimin] I'll really know how it feels
back in Korea.

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:37.670
-You think so?
-Yeah.

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:39.238
[Jimin] Has it been about a week?

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.474
[Jung Kook] More than a week
since discharge.

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.609
Right, about a week and a half.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.711
ARRIVED AT THE LODGING

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.413
Let's go in. It's cool.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.682
Let me scan the keycard.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.350
[strains]

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.886
[Jung Kook] We're here!

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:57.590
[director] Just make what you plan to eat.

00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.926
-We bought a lot to eat together.
-Really?

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.195
This is too much for us.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.363
It was within the budget.

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:07.567
SOUND SIGNALS THAT COOKING HAS BEGUN

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.868
[humming]

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:11.971
JUNG COOK'S COOKING CLASS

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:16.476
MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE COOKING

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.644
SMELLING IT

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:19.745
Mmm.

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.683
JUNG COOK BBQ RECIPE:
1. SPREAD BUTCHER PAPER

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.619
CONFIDENT HANDS

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:28.488
2. WRAP MEAT IN BUTCHER PAPER

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.258
3. WRAP IT IN ALUMINUM FOIL

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.829
MEAT GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE OVEN

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:41.367
I'll cook it in the oven
at about 70 degrees

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:44.437
and then quickly sear it outside.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.439
That's what I'm thinking!

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.775
THE MEAT TURNING DELICIOUS

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.211
The oven... I need to look it up.

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:53.946
"At a low temperature..."

00:16:56.716 --> 00:17:00.119
I have no clue.
It says it takes around seven hours.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:05.658
An hour and a half at 75 degrees.
Will it cook through?

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:07.393
It's just intuition, really.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.629
Jimin, what are you doing?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.097
Studying how to make rice.

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:16.969
SERIOUSLY WATCHING POT RICE VIDEO

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.107
I watched how to make pot rice,
but it was a failed one.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.175
I watched a failure for 28 minutes.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.011
Can I do it well?

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:28.814
Hey, are you going to eat rice or pasta?

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.383
Anything.

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.587
Then should I just make rice next time?

00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:36.856
-Yeah, that'd be better.
-All right.

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:39.525
-Anything I can help with?
-Nope. Thanks, though.

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:40.793
JIMIN'S POT RICE NEXT TIME

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.529
JUNG COOK'S SECOND DISH

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.798
JUNG COOK'S PASTA RECIPE
1. POUR OLIVE OIL IN POT

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.700
2. ADD MILK

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:51.137
3. ADD PLENTY OF BUTTER

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.472
4. GRIND SALT AND PEPPER

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.608
If I make the sauce now,

00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:58.311
it'll be easy to cook the pasta later.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.079
Carbonara pasta.

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:02.014
JUNG COOK'S SECOND DISH
CARBONARA PASTA

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.584
SAUCE KICK: CARBONARA STICK

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.153
How did they come up with this?

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.554
It's going to be delicious.

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:09.956
ADDING SAUCE

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:17.930
One more packet will be perfect.

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.934
MORE SAUCE IS BETTER

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:25.671
This pasta water is salty.

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.807
So it should be a bit bland.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:32.812
If you cook pasta in plain water,
it won't be seasoned.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.513
So it tastes sweet.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.848
And it doesn't blend.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.554
Delicious.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.023
I'll be using a wide pan.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.727
Once it thickens,
I'll turn it off and refrigerate.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.899
CARBONARA PASTA SAUCE DONE

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.668
It will be thickened
when it mixed with noodles.

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:57.670
Done. I'll go get some rest now.

00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:59.839
RESTING WHILE THE MEAT COOKS

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:02.541
REST COMES TO THE LODGING

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:08.914
WHEN JUNG KOOK RESTS, JIMIN MOVES

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.651
It's not hard to peel garlic. It's easy.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.554
STARTING WITH GARLIC

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.690
WITH HIS BARE HANDS

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:20.926
EXPERIENCED VIBE
JIMIN'S QUICK GARLIC PREP

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.662
Everyone watching this...

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:26.098
What are you thinking as you watch this?

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.768
Do you think I'm really bad at this?

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.237
Caught you, right?

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.075
You're thinking, "Jimin can use a knife.
He's all grown up."

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:37.309
Caught you, right?

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.946
"Look at Jimin, focusing so hard."

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.015
I got it, right?

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:45.718
Surprised, weren't you?

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:48.054
WHILE JIMIN PLAYS WITH THE CAMERA

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.858
SINGING PUPPY APPEARS

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.193
[Jung Kook] What?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.929
Were you peeling it in advance?

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:58.898
-Actually...
-Yeah.

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:01.300
This was supposed to be a surprise.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.202
-Okay.
-You shouldn't have come out now.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:04.737
-Me?
-Can you go back in?

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:06.272
I'll ask them to edit it out.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:08.374
Can you come out saying, "What?"

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:09.742
-Should I?
-Yes.

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:13.012
Come out and say,
"He peeled all this? He's amazing."

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.480
What?

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:15.915
-Not like that.
-No?

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.018
What a cocky reaction.

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:21.053
This guy.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.255
This garlic is pretty dug out.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.893
-Did you dig while peeling it?
-Yeah.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.731
Stress makes the garlic delicious.
Apparently, the juice comes out.

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:33.365
Should I give it proper stress?

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.601
Should I roll it a few times?

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:39.004
Hey, focus. Hey.

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:40.573
It'll be delicious.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:43.743
Oh! My eyes.

00:20:44.677 --> 00:20:46.078
Good job.

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.613
Good work.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.682
-Hold on.
-What is it now?

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:53.319
Hey, you're here already?
I was going to surprise you.

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.620
I'm going in.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:56.889
Not cool.

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:57.957
[laughing]

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.561
JUNG COOK STARTS COOKING FOR REAL

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:13.372
IT'S TIME TO ENJOY WATCHING JUNG KOOK COOK

00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:18.010
SPRINKLING SALT

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:21.447
READY TO BOIL NOODLES

00:21:21.514 --> 00:21:22.882
I think I can take it out now.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.049
CHECKING PRE-COOKED MEAT

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.791
The sauce is all absorbed.

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.193
Wait, wait.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.162
Where are the plates?

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.197
Jimin, where are the plates?

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:40.232
Plates?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.869
Drawer above the fridge, on the right.

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.604
[Jung Kook] Here? Oh.

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:49.008
CHECKING THE MEAT

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.448
-[Jimin] Can I ask you something?
-Yes.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.284
Why are you putting it in here?

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.085
I'll cook it once more.

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.555
And this...

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.924
KEEPING THE MEAT OIL SEPARATELY

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.994
JUNG KOOK ORGANIZES AND PASSES

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.398
JIMIN CLEANS UP NEATLY

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.366
Do we have red wine?

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.869
-Yes, we do.
-Can you bring it?

00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:18.037
I'll bring it.

00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:21.307
-Oh, it was there.
-Here. That was quick, right?

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.509
-Can you tell me when to stop?
-Yes.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.544
[Jung Kook] That's enough.

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:28.747
AFTER MAKING THE RED WINE SAUCE
FOR THE MEAT

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:32.351
PUTTING THE FINISHED SAUCE
INTO A BOWL FOR NOW

00:22:35.254 --> 00:22:39.058
COOKING MEAT IN A SAUCEPAN

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.197
POURING THE RED WINE SAUCE
OVER THE MEAT

00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:46.732
Just put it all in.

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.500
STARTING TO BOIL PASTA SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.170
TWO DISHES AT ONCE, SMOOTHLY

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:57.176
Jimin, stir-fry this nicely, please.

00:22:57.243 --> 00:22:58.244
Okay.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.180
Let's make a feast.

00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:05.084
SUPER FOCUSED

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.720
DILIGENTLY STIR-FRYING VEGGIES

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:10.923
THE FINISHED MEAT WILL REST

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.292
-Add mushrooms now.
-Yes.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:15.194
-All of the mushrooms?
-Yes.

00:23:16.362 --> 00:23:18.497
PERFECTLY COOKED PASTA

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:20.132
We have plenty of time.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.234
PASTA ENTERING FINAL STAGE

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.903
-Thank you so much.
-Yes.

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:27.239
You were a huge help.

00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:31.210
It's hot.

00:23:31.277 --> 00:23:35.047
PASTA SAUCE ON STANDBY

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.420
CARBONARA PASTA SAUCE GOING IN

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:43.188
TASTING

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.957
PASS

00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:48.360
FINALLY ADDING NOODLES

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:51.597
DELICIOUS-LOOKING PASTA IS READY

00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:53.799
JUNG KOOK TASTING PASTA

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:57.136
JIMIN MOVES SECRETLY BEHIND HIM

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:59.271
[woman] You want to eat this,
you can cook it.

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:00.539
[in English] What is this?

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.207
-[in Korean] Potato pancake?
-Yeah.

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.109
You can just fry it as is in a pan.

00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:07.212
Great. Now I have something
I can cook for him.

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.581
WAIT, JUNG KOOK, I'LL MAKE IT FOR YOU

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.650
PLENTY

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.453
DUMPING THE POTATOES IN

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.223
Oh, no, this isn't right.
It's all broken. Goodness.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.391
This...

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.261
Spread it like this.

00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:24.196
EYEBROW WIGGLE

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.899
PICKING UP OIL AGAIN

00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:29.601
ADDING MORE OIL

00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:32.071
LOOKING SATISFIED

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:35.240
FEELING LIKE IT'S GOING SMOOTHLY

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:37.910
Oh, really?

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.348
RÖSTI REBELS VIOLENTLY

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.416
PASSED OUT?

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:46.151
Pancakes don't go easy, Jimin.

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.187
JUNG COOK TAKES OVER

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.055
[both exclaiming]

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:53.092
RÖSTI POTATO PANCAKE EXPLOSION

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.994
RÖSTI HAS ELIMINATED PARK JIMIN

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.862
RÖSTI HAS ELIMINATED JUNG KOOK TOO

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:59.832
RÖSTI IS GOING CRAZY

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.701
Hey, Jimin. What did you do to this?

00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:05.170
The potatoes are moist.

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:08.140
JUNG COOK STEPPING IN TO TAKE CARE OF IT

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:09.842
But I need to do this.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:11.310
-What?
-Please leave.

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:14.947
I'm not getting the look I imagined.

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:17.049
-Jimin.
-Yes.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.451
Did you want to eat this?

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.553
Potato?

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.522
I wanted to make something for you.

00:25:25.324 --> 00:25:26.325
Enjoy it.

00:25:26.392 --> 00:25:28.193
-What?
-I mean, make it delicious.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.195
-You want me to?
-Why won't it cook?

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:31.463
Why won't this cook?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.466
JIMIN'S BATTLE WITH THE RÖSTI CONTINUES

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.738
NOTICES SOMETHING

00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:45.411
SEALING IT

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:47.880
SOUNDS VIOLENT

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:50.449
Sounds like popcorn inside.

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:52.484
TIME TO CHECK

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.552
Wait a second.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:54.987
SCARED

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.056
EVEN MORE VIOLENT RÖSTI

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:00.259
CAREFULLY OPENING THE LID

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.326
SECOND SEALING

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.394
[Jung Kook] Jimin.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:03.896
Are you okay?

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:07.533
I'm thinking of just washing it like this.

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.436
BRAVELY OPENING THE LID

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.271
THE ATTACK RESUMES

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:15.574
THE ATTACK IS RELENTLESS

00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:19.445
USING ROLLING SKILLS

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.580
REJECTION

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.182
You okay?

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.249
TASTING IT

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.118
-Let's just eat it.
-Should we?

00:26:26.185 --> 00:26:28.554
Yeah, it'll be fine.
Let's use it as a garnish.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.855
FINAL SEALING

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.157
Cooking feels like a war
for the first time.

00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:33.625
-Jimin.
-Gosh.

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:35.994
Let's use it as a garnish here, okay?

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:37.496
-On here?
-Put it on here.

00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:38.664
[in English] Okay, okay.

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:41.200
[in Korean] It felt like getting shot.

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:44.937
RÖSTI STATUS CHANGED FROM MAIN TO GARNISH

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:46.004
[Jung Kook] Perfect.

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:48.107
-Let's eat now.
-Yeah.

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:53.112
-[Jimin] Let's try it.
-See, the bone's separated, right?

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:54.646
Fork it like this and...

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:59.785
JUNG KOOK SHOWING
HIS CARBONARA PASTA

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:00.919
Look.

00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:04.223
If you have this with the pasta...

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.091
JUNG COOK IS KIND ENOUGH
TO CUT THE MEAT FOR HIM

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:07.159
Thank you.

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:09.928
I can eat this in one bite.

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:11.463
SERVICE SATISFACTION

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.031
Thank you.

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:17.569
-Mmm!
-It's good, right?

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:20.739
-So good to eat together.
-Right?

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.108
[Jimin] I'm really curious about this.

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.811
I mean, is this even edible?

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:30.282
WHAT IS THIS?

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:31.350
Why?

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.953
JUNG KOOK TASTES IT TOO

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:37.990
The potato's good.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:40.192
It's good.

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.096
Why so shy?

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:45.831
I'm not shy.

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:46.899
Why?

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.567
I'm grateful that you're eating it.

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.803
-It's a war-like potato.
-Mmm!

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.472
-Call it war potato.
-War potato.

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.275
FIERCE BUT DELICIOUS

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:58.544
The pasta...

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.012
is seriously good.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.849
If we add two more carbonara
sauce packets, won't it be better?

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:06.552
Should we set some aside for the staff
and add more?

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:07.619
-Should we?
-Yeah.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.488
SETTING PASTA ASIDE FOR THE STAFF FIRST

00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:10.689
What?

00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:11.757
[groans]

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:13.559
That's a lot of pasta.

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.327
Send it back if it's not good.

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:18.630
Should I add two packets?

00:28:24.136 --> 00:28:25.370
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.372
Oh, Jimin.

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:28.440
Here we go.

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.108
It got even better.

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:31.210
JIMIN HAVING A BITE

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.349
EATING MEAT TOO

00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:39.051
It's delicious.

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.285
SATISFIED

00:28:40.352 --> 00:28:42.254
-Thank you.
-This is so good.

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:45.390
I just realized I love pasta.

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:46.725
You just realized?

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:48.393
PROUD

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.064
Tonkatsu was number one food for me,
but this probably tops the list now.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.733
THE PERFECT DINNER
HAS CHANGED JIMIN'S FAVORITE FOOD

00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:56.301
I'm so full.

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:57.469
SWISS NIGHT DEEPENS

00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:58.770
[director] Clap once.

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:01.640
One, two, three.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:02.708
START

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.876
Today, we have...

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.312
-one powerful penalty.
-Tell us the game first.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.748
SCARED

00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:10.816
What is it?

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.818
-A penalty?
-[director] Yes.

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.886
[director] Well, rather than a penalty...

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:18.156
While planning this trip,

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:22.261
we wanted to pursue minimalism
and follow current trends.

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:25.364
You can think of this game
as a reflection of that.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.299
You're not taking everything away, right?

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:31.603
[director] This year's travel trend
is minimalism.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.774
So you'll be packing as light as possible.

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:39.044
Just pack the essentials for now.

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.746
[Jung Kook] Put them in for now.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:46.251
FORCED TO MOVE THEIR STUFF
INTO SMALL SUITCASES

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.087
AND MINIMALISM STRIKES AGAIN

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:52.090
THIS TIME, IT'S TIME

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:56.628
[director] This game
has six questions in total.

00:29:56.695 --> 00:30:00.365
Listen to the lyrics
and name the artist and song title.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:02.334
If you get nothing right, it's 12 hours.

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:07.039
But what does minimalism
have to do with time?

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:09.841
Okay, here we go. We'll begin right away.

00:30:10.342 --> 00:30:12.911
[AI voice] Jumping like this
and jumping like that.

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.947
ME

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.082
MAYBE NOT

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.383
Jin's "Super Tuna"?

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.119
I think I heard that jumping part. No?

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.521
[AI] Your eyes are sparkling.

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.156
-"Super Tuna"?
-Let's be friends.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:25.490
"Let's be friends"?

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.125
It's not our song at least, is it?

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.194
Is it our song?

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:31.496
"Let's be friends."

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.532
Do we have such a song?

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:36.368
Wait, wait a minute.
Why would we be friends?

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:39.771
[AI] Your eyes are sparkling.
Let's be friends.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:40.972
GOING CRAZY

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:44.042
"Your eyes are sparkling,
let's be friends"? These are lyrics?

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:46.211
BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:48.980
YES, THAT IS MY BROTHER'S SONG LYRICS

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:51.983
WHAT KIND OF SONG IS THIS?

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.219
[singing]

00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:56.154
TITLE: UNTITLED
COMPOSITION &amp; VOCAL: JIMIN

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:58.657
I have no idea.

00:30:58.724 --> 00:31:00.425
[director] Now, what's your answer?

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:01.593
I really don't know.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.362
One, two, three.

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:04.629
Jin's "Super Tuna."

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.132
-Correct.
-We were right!

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:13.572
WHY IS THIS THE ANSWER?

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:14.773
Wow, really?

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.508
-It was Jin's song.
-Amazing.

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:19.878
Because of the jump part,
I thought it was Jin.

00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:21.313
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.914
-Deducted two hours.
-Okay.

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:24.449
[director] You got one right.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.651
Next question.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.520
[AI] When our music starts...

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:30.155
Ah.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:31.656
Wait.

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:33.892
[AI] People go crazy, go nuts.

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.428
-Our style is No More Dream.
-Must be our song.

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:38.764
Stepping on our seniors' backs on stage.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.831
What?

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:43.435
Isn't this BTS's "No More Dream"?
No? Wait, it's not.

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:44.870
Stepping on backs...

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:46.238
Why step on backs?

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:49.541
In our "No More Dream," you know,

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:51.843
the highlight is stepping on backs.
That's why?

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.645
PLAYING MORE

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:55.514
-Last one? Yes.
-Playing it.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.315
[AI] When our music starts,

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.418
people go crazy, go nuts.

00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:01.686
Our style is No More Dream.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.055
That guy is really annoying.

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:06.525
-Because of that voice...
-I can't focus.

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.760
AI GUY IS DEFINITELY THE SABOTEUR

00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:11.396
[director] Okay, here we go.
One, two, three.

00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:12.931
BTS's...

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.100
-"Dope"?
-[director] Wrong.

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:16.234
[Jimin] What is it?

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:20.071
[AI] Stepping on our seniors' backs
on stage.

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.506
[in English] I'm sorry, man.

00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:23.875
What? What more can I say?

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.178
Ah.

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:27.245
TOTALLY KNOWS

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.981
WHAT IS IT...?

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.817
-"Attack on Bangtan."
-Correct.

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.885
That guy is really annoying.

00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:35.821
YEAH, ME TOO

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:37.055
STILL TEN HOURS LEFT

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.423
Third question.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.493
[AI in Korean] Twenty-four hours,
if I could only be with you.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.561
I KNOW

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.796
[director] One, two, three.

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:45.864
Two, three.

00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:47.132
BTS.

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:48.900
"Just One Day"?

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.302
-Correct.
-Right. Good.

00:32:50.869 --> 00:32:54.339
[AI] I'd kiss you starting in the morning.
Can't forget to grab some brunch.

00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.407
SO ANNOYING

00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.242
Seriously cheesy.

00:32:57.876 --> 00:32:59.845
"All these things."

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.214
"I'll confess to you."

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.748
-"Just One Day."
-"Just One Day."

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.117
CURRENT SCORE
4 HOURS DEDUCTED FROM 12

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.153
Get three more right,
down to two hours.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.055
-Here we go.
-[AI] Don't even apologize.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.557
Look closely. Look at your pathetic self.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.161
"Don't even apologize"?

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.096
SEARCH COMPLETE

00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:20.298
I think I know.

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:23.268
PLEASE GET IT RIGHT

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.569
[director] One, two, three.

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.571
BTS, "MIC Drop"?

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:27.639
[director] Correct.

00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:29.307
Wow! You're so good.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:32.344
We didn't intend it,
but we have Jung Kook.

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:36.481
-Here we go.
-[AI in English] Where my money? Yah.

00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:37.749
[both singing]

00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:38.850
I KNOW THIS

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.452
What song?

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:42.287
"Go Go."

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.855
BTS's "Go Go."

00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:45.790
CORRECT

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:46.892
Last question.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:49.027
4 OUT OF 5 CORRECT
ONLY 1 QUESTION LEFT

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:51.129
[AI in Korean] What were you
dreaming of...

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.465
[both singing]

00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:56.868
SO EXCITED,
LIKE THEY'RE SURE THEY KNOW

00:33:56.935 --> 00:33:58.937
[continue singing]

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.073
BTS, "No More Dream."

00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:04.242
CORRECT

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:05.443
I got one wrong.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.380
But this is pretty good, right?
Just two hours of penalty.

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:09.881
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:11.016
Penalty.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:13.685
What is it?

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:14.753
EYES FIXED

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:17.889
PENALTY FINALLY REVEALED

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.358
WHAT...

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.260
IS...

00:34:22.327 --> 00:34:23.995
THAT?

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:26.064
It's a prison.

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:28.600
YES, IT'S A PRISON

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:29.668
I know.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:32.470
We have to lock our wallet
in the prison for two hours.

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.039
-Right?
-No.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.841
IF NOT THE WALLET...

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.210
-Phones?
-[director] That's right.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.445
[Jimin] Starting now?

00:34:40.512 --> 00:34:42.314
[director] We'll do it when we want.

00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:47.218
[Jimin] Not having to give back this
phone? It felt incredible last night.

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:50.689
So I forced myself to stay awake
just to keep using it.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:58.196
WHILE WAITING FOR FOOD AT RESTAURANTS

00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:01.633
EVEN WHILE RESTING AT THE LODGE

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.703
THEY HELD THEIR PHONES TIGHT
UNTIL THEY WENT TO SLEEP

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:07.138
SO WE PREPARED DIGITAL MINIMALISM

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:09.407
-Is this the military?
-It's the military.

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.543
NIGHT OF MADNESS

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.745
The only thing that makes me happy now

00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:15.614
is using my phone at night.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.849
PHONE IS THIS IMPORTANT
10 DAYS AFTER DISCHARGE

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.784
If you do this, they'll take it at night.

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.152
So annoying.

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.588
Is this the military or what?

00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:27.726
They'll take it right when we're done
and we're going to bed.

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.828
Seriously, so annoying.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.997
I won't sleep for two hours
no matter what.

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.331
Eyes open.

00:35:33.398 --> 00:35:34.733
"Give me back my phone!"

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:37.802
This is random, right?
You'll ambush us unexpectedly.

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:40.271
Yes, but we'll make sure
it's for two hours.

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:41.439
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.441
Didn't expect you to get them all right.

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:46.177
-Thanks.
-We have even have locks on them.

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:49.748
DIGITAL MINIMALISM
COMING SOON

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:53.318
Now, another important thing
is deciding when to wake up.

00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:55.020
DECIDING WAKE-UP TIME

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:57.555
-Honestly, this is more important to me.
-Right.

00:35:57.622 --> 00:36:00.025
-It's important to us all.
-Right, it is.

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:01.459
What game do you want to play?

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.495
We're not good at brain stuff.

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:05.196
No, we're not.

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.132
What game are we good at?

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.434
How about racing Jung Kook?

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:10.568
Push-ups?

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:11.736
Arm wrestling?

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.139
SHAKING HEAD

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.341
WE REFUSE PHYSICAL COMPETITION
WITH JUNG KOOK

00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:18.543
-Or how about Cham Cham Cham?
-[director] Good.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.211
I've gotten better at it.

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:23.782
I actually picked up a skill for it
in the army. Yes.

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.851
I didn't just waste
that year and a half, you know.

00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:31.322
CHAM CHAM CHAM - 4 ROUNDS
MUK-JJI-PPA - 3 ROUNDS

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:34.726
IF THEY WIN ALL ROUNDS,
THEY CAN WAKE UP AT 10:30

00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:36.828
-This is pretty big.
-But...

00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:38.930
YOU WANT TO WAKE UP LATE?

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.867
-Why'd you do that?
-It's just...

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.869
If we win, it's good for the director too.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.337
DIRECTOR, YOU WANT IT TOO?

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.539
Who's going first?

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:49.107
-Good luck.
-Let's go.

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:51.509
Wow. When we played yutnori the other day,

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:54.846
you were like, "Did you shout 'Go'?"
And now...

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:56.214
Did you shout "Go"?

00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:57.749
Come on.

00:36:57.816 --> 00:36:59.250
STAFF TRIED TO NITPICK

00:36:59.818 --> 00:37:01.686
YESTERDAY'S ENEMY BECAME TODAY'S FRIEND

00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:04.055
-I'll use my skill first.
-[in English] Okay, okay.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:07.192
REVEALING HIS SKILL

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:10.428
CURIOUS - PRESSURED

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:12.397
FOR EVERYONE'S MORNING SLEEP

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:14.466
[director] Okay, here I go.
Cham, cham, cham!

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.936
JIMIN'S SKILL WINS

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:19.404

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:23.608
Cham, cham, cham!

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:24.676

-Go, Jung Kook.

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:31.683
Still got 30 minutes.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.218
I'll try for 30 minutes too.

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.652
[Jimin] You must look up, okay?

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.588
EYES UP AND READY

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.623
YEAH, THAT'S IT

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:39.691
Cham, cham, cham!

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:41.092
JUNG KOOK WINS

00:37:41.526 --> 00:37:43.161
OH, YEAH
+30 MIN

00:37:43.228 --> 00:37:45.330
-Keep the momentum going.
-Go now.

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.531
GAMES ARE ABOUT MOMENTUM

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:47.999
Cham, cham, cham!

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:49.567
JUNG KOOK WINS AGAIN!

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.070
THIS IS THE MOMENTUM

00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:53.138
WELL DONE

00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:55.640
This is a good skill.

00:37:55.707 --> 00:37:57.075
It's 8:30 for now.

00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:58.343
Okay.

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:00.278
THEY APPLAUD,
HOPING TO WAKE UP AT 10:00

00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:02.080
If we get 1.5 hours here, it's 10:00.

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:03.581
-Right.
-Just Muk-jji-ppa left.

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:04.883
Hey, use the skill.

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:06.851
How about that?

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:08.453
I'll go first then.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.054
-Let's try one round each.
-Okay.

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.122
JIMIN GOES FIRST AGAIN

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:12.857
-I'll challenge now.
-Challenge.

00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:14.793
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:15.860
JIMIN GOES FIRST

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:17.996
SKILL REACTIVATED

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.063
Ppa!

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.265
WAKE-UP TIME +30

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.466
-Momentum.
-Momentum.

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:23.134
Should I go for one more?

00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:24.803
-Or you?
-It's your momentum.

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:27.105
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:38:27.172 --> 00:38:28.206
JIMIN GOES FIRST

00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:29.274
Ppa!

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.742
JIMIN'S SECOND ATTACK

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:31.910
Ppa!

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.311
SKILL ON

00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:35.246
EXPRESSIONS SYNCHRONIZED

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:37.182
Jji.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.184
MOMENTUM COLLAPSED

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.318
Jji.

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:41.386
Sorry.

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.521
EMBARRASSED

00:38:43.588 --> 00:38:44.622
It's okay.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:47.292
What if I lose?
Okay, I'll try the last one.

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:48.726
FINAL SHOWDOWN FOR LAST 30 MIN

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:51.129
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON JUNG KOOK

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:54.833
FINAL BOSS APPEARS

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.835
-Wait, is it 8:30 now?
-Nine o'clock.

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.936
-9:00?
-Yeah.

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.504
-Let's get to 9:30.
-9:30.

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.006
Here we go, rock-paper-scissors.

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.075
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:05.810
Defense.

00:39:05.877 --> 00:39:07.178
PLEASE, DEFENSE

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:08.246
Ppa.

00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:09.347
LIKE HE'S POSSESSED

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:12.050
Ppa.

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:14.319
BYE-BYE, SWEET 30 MINUTES

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:16.087
No. Nine o'clock is...

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:17.722
-That's not bad.
-It's good.

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:21.292
I can wake up smiling at 9:00.

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.328
MY HEART

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.762
CALM DOWN

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:26.297
But we leave at 10:30.

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.633
Turns out Muk-jji-ppa
is bad for your heart.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:30.935
LATEST WAKE-UP TIME

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:32.670
ANTICIPATING MOST RELAXED MORNING

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.975
OFF TO SEE STARS IN THE SWISS SKY
TODAY'S FINAL ACTIVITY

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.109
[Jung Kook] Right now.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.714
[singing]

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.049
I want to experience the night.

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:50.021
For the past three days,
we've been seeing such pretty things,

00:39:50.088 --> 00:39:52.357
but only in the daytime.

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:54.125
I like nighttime,

00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:57.795
and I hear the nights in Switzerland
are incredible.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:40:01.332
[director] At night, in the Zermatt area
we're going to,

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:04.235
-they have a stargazing tour.
-Really?

00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:06.070
[Jung Kook] Wow. What?

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.006
JUNG KOOK'S LISTENING TOO

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.340
I want to go.

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:13.945
[director] We'll check
if we can make a reservation.

00:40:14.012 --> 00:40:15.213
Oh, thank you.

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:17.248
It's an honor.

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:22.086
But will we see stars
like we saw in New Zealand?

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.788
That was legendary.

00:40:23.855 --> 00:40:25.189
-The Milky Way?
-Yeah.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:27.525
The Milky Way was really wow.

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:30.295
It was the best. I even dreamed about it.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.729
-Let's take a selfie.
-Yeah.

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:34.032
It's brighter than I thought.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.303
They were going to take our phones?

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.274
Don't make me angry.

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.878
ARRIVED AT STARGAZING TOUR SPOT

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:48.579
This is where we see the stars?

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:51.416
[director] We need to walk up
a bit from here.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.851
[Jimin] Need to go
where there's no light.

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:56.054
It's here. Jung Kook.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.722
MOVING TO FIND BEST NIGHT SKY

00:40:57.789 --> 00:40:59.490
I can see some stars even now.

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.125
Even though there's light.

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.263
[Jimin] Darn these weeds.
Time to trim them down.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.898
STILL THINKING LIKE SERGEANT PARK

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:12.537
-Wow, I can already see tons of stars.
-I know.

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:14.439
Probably because of the altitude.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:15.540
I know.

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.408
Where is it?

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:19.177
Where could it be?

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:22.847
Where?

00:41:22.914 --> 00:41:24.048
I think this is it.

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:25.249
I think so too.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.884
ARRIVED SOON AT STARGAZING SPOT

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.086
[Jimin] Wow.

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.021
Hey, look up.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.824
-[Jung Kook] Wow.
-Hey, there are so many stars.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.058
[Jung Kook] I know. Wait.

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.794
It'd be better if that light wasn't there.

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.529
That orange color.

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:41.666
[Jung Kook] Wow.
There really are lots of stars.

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.434
-[Jimin] Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.236
[Jimin] This is it.

00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:46.604
SCURRYING

00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:47.905
It's a prime spot.

00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:51.642
JUNG KOOK DISAPPEARING INTO DARKNESS
TO GET TO PRIME SPOT

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:54.312
[Jung Kook exclaiming]

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:58.916
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK WATCHING STARS
IN IDENTICAL POSES

00:41:59.584 --> 00:42:00.685
This is good.

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:02.520
I can see them so well.

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:06.858
COUNTLESS STARS EMBROIDER THE NIGHT SKY

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:11.195
THEY CAN'T STOP EXCLAIMING

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.764
[Jung Kook] I can't believe this.

00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:14.599
This is crazy.

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.038
Honestly, it wasn't like this
on our way up.

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.572
JUNG KOOK WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.042
[Jimin] This is insane. It's so romantic.

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:26.644
ZERMATT'S BEAUTIFUL NIGHT SKY
HAS GOT THEM SPEECHLESS

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.079
Wow, it's incredible.

00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:30.948
EMOTIONS THEY'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE
RUSHING IN

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.317
[Jung Kook] I need to...

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:35.520
capture this with a camera.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:36.754
DIGITAL LIGHT ATTACK

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:38.890
WANTING TO KEEP IT LONGER BY TAKING PHOTOS

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.925
Where's it? Oh, it's here. Geez.

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:42.960
JUNG KOOK ATTEMPTING
TO PHOTOGRAPH NIGHT SKY

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.195
[Jung Kook] Oh, sorry.

00:42:46.464 --> 00:42:47.799
[Jimin] Galaxy.

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:51.335
JIMIN LEARNING HOW TO SHOOT ON YOUTUBE

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.405
Timer two seconds.

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:56.607
-Wait.
-Wow, look at this, Jimin.

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:58.810
MEANWHILE, JUNG KOOK
SUCCESSFULLY TAKES A PHOTO

00:42:58.876 --> 00:42:59.877
Look.

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:03.081
ZERMATT'S NIGHT SKY
PHOTOGRAPHED BY JUNG KOOK

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.483
Wow, this is amazing, isn't it?

00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:07.785
[Jimin] Okay, I'll try too.

00:43:07.852 --> 00:43:08.886
I'm all set.

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:11.289
JIMIN APPLYING WHAT HE JUST LEARNT

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.825
[Jung Kook] Should I shoot in wide angle?

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:16.828
I should try again with the wide angle.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.663
-[Jimin] Hey, we have a problem.
-What?

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.699
[Jimin] I didn't know I had to hold it
for, like, 30 seconds.

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:24.202
-I should put it down on the ground.
-I did that.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:26.237
[Jimin] Let me try this first.

00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:28.773
THE NIGHT SKY KEEPS MAKING THEM EXCLAIM

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:37.648
JIMIN DOESN'T GIVE UP
AND PERSISTENTLY FILMS THE STARS

00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.256
-Shoot.
-Why?

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:47.859
-What is it?
-I held it for 30 seconds, but...

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.594
Did you take a photo of yourself?

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.895
[both laughing]

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:58.836
God. I was taking a picture of my face
for 30 seconds.

00:43:58.903 --> 00:44:02.140
THE RESULT OF 30 SECONDS OF PATIENCE:
JIMIN'S FACE SPARKLING LIKE A STAR

00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:06.077
Hope you have a good time with this.

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.879
-[Jimin] Thank you.
-What is this?

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.247
-[Jung Kook] What is it?
-This is...

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.315
A GIFT FOR MORE SPECIAL MEMORIES

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.317
[Jung Kook] What is this?
What could it be?

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.520
-[Jimin] Wow, no way.
-What is this?

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.522
[Jung Kook] Wow, it's whiskey.

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.589
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:21.959
[Jung Kook] And it's the whiskey
that was in the freezer.

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:26.063
-They're really giving us a proper gift.
-Director, if you do this...

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.565
I'll work hard at the games.

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:30.201
-Hey, give them the phone.
-What?

00:44:30.268 --> 00:44:31.936
-Give them the phone.
-The phone?

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.139
No.

00:44:35.206 --> 00:44:37.074
-Should we toast?
-Sounds so good.

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.911
Good. But I'm really grateful for this.

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.012
I know.

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.848
Since we've just been discharged
from the military...

00:44:43.915 --> 00:44:44.916
You see this?

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.918
Wow.

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.286
Wow, drinking it from this?

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.887
-This is...
-Cheers.

00:44:50.388 --> 00:44:52.890
CHEERS TO A DEEP NIGHT AND DEEP MEMORIES

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:56.961
[Jimin] In the end, this world
is about emotions and romance.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.031
-It's kind of perfect right now.
-[Jung Kook] Right.

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:01.966
[Jimin] It exploded.

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:04.335
CHILLY SWISS NIGHT
A GLASS OF WHISKY WITH THE STARS

00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:06.804
THEY'LL NEVER FORGET TONIGHT'S STARRY SKY

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.940
-Those stars over there...
-Yeah.

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:11.108
-They're all twinkling. Just there.
-Yes.

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:12.276
I see it too.

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.547
And not just there.
There's a bunch of them over there, too.

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:19.417
Yeah. You see that over there?

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:22.320
I think that's the Milky Way. That part.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.422
Here. Don't you see some kind of a path?

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:26.724
-Yeah.
-Right? That's the Milky Way.

00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:30.995
Gotta see them with your own eyes.

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.830
Yeah, there's no other way.

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:40.304
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK
QUIETLY GAZE AT THE NIGHT SKY

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:46.244
[Jung Kook] I want to do a concert soon.

00:45:46.978 --> 00:45:48.112
[Jimin] Me too.

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.352
[♪ upbeat music playing]

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:58.856
THE COUNTLESS STARS
REMIND THEM OF THE ARMY

00:45:59.991 --> 00:46:05.329
THE MOMENTS THEY SHONE
WITH THE STARS CALLED THE ARMY

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.167
THEY LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING THEM AGAIN

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.203
Jimin, let's live hard tomorrow too.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.972
-Let's do that.
-That was so random.

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.510
[Jung Kook] If a shooting star
passed by right now,

00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:21.279
that'd be awesome, right?

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:24.615
[Jung Kook] I don't know why,
but only those stars are twinkling.

00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:25.683
-Oh!
-Oh!

00:46:26.684 --> 00:46:27.685
...are twinkling.

00:46:27.752 --> 00:46:28.753
-Oh!
-Oh!

00:46:30.388 --> 00:46:31.422
...are twinkling.

00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:32.490
-Oh!
-Oh!

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.259
NOT A FROZEN SCREEN

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:36.560
Make a wish.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.862
A shooting star, right?

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:40.498
-Definitely.
-It fell vertically.

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.166
Yeah. I saw it too.

00:46:42.233 --> 00:46:44.235
A SHOOTING STAR
A GIFT FROM THE SKY

00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:46.237
What's happening? Make a wish.

00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.305
Wow!

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:49.173
[Jung Kook] We're seeing it here again.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.143
MAKING WISHES WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:56.681
WHAT ARE THEY SILENTLY WISHING FOR?

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:59.116
I wished for BTS to last 40 more years.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.385
You can't say it out loud.

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:04.255
What? It's my wish, not yours.

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.724
If you say your wish...

00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:09.694
It'll be okay. It's my wish.
No one can touch that.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.762
This is the third one I've seen so far.

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.165
-I saw one in Malta.
-Yeah.

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:15.900
Do you know when the other time was?

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.134
In the military.

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:19.170
-Really?
-When I stayed outside one night.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:25.409
THE LOVE FOR THE SWISS NIGHT SKY
NEVER ENDS

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:27.111
We even saw a shooting star.

00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:29.613
If we stay here,
I feel like we'll see one more.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.682
Was this arranged too?

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:33.417
Isn't that usually your thing?

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:34.685
[Jimin chuckles]

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:36.020
The sky is your department.

00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:37.321
Everything's been arranged.

00:47:37.388 --> 00:47:40.758
So I told the moon
to move aside for tonight.

00:47:40.825 --> 00:47:41.926
[both chuckle]

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.861
-[Jimin] Moon isn't visible, is it?
-No.

00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:46.664
I asked it to move aside
so we could see the stars tonight.

00:47:46.731 --> 00:47:48.199
So, was it an event?

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.700
-The shooting star?
-Of course.

00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:53.070
But that wasn't discussed earlier,
so I'm touched.

00:47:53.137 --> 00:47:56.107
So it was kind of a surprise for a client?

00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:02.980
You know, when lightning strikes...

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:05.383
-Yeah.
-...they try to time it

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.752
-and end up doing it perfectly.
-Yeah.

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:08.953
In those videos.

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.255
But it's hard to capture shooting stars.

00:48:11.322 --> 00:48:13.124
It's not just hard, it's impossible.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.525
What if it happens now?

00:48:16.527 --> 00:48:17.528
Right now.

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.363
Like this.

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:22.533
Right now?

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:24.969
Right now?

00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:28.873
[Jung Kook] This is so good.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:32.443
-But this stargazing thing...
-Yeah.

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:37.515
[Jimin] I feel like
the memory fades quickly.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.283
-Why?
-I mean,

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.818
there are good memories.

00:48:40.885 --> 00:48:43.020
For example, we went paragliding.

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.122
-There are certain scenes.
-Yeah.

00:48:45.189 --> 00:48:47.124
Those remain as memories.

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:49.393
The good feeling
of seeing the stars remains.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.895
Right, come to think of it.

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.797
-Somehow, this...
-The scene?

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.899
Yeah, the scene doesn't stick in memory.

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.934
So it's shocking every time.

00:48:57.001 --> 00:49:00.638
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY EVERY SINGLE TIME
IS AS THRILLING AS THE FIRST TIME

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:03.574
It's really nice.

00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:05.443
SAYING IT'S NICE FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.446
We would've regretted it
if we hadn't come here.

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.381
It's cold, but it's so good.

00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.283
GLAD THEY DIDN'T MISS THIS MOMENT

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:15.986
LOOKING AROUND

00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:19.423
Is the staff enjoying it?
Or are they cold?

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.192
I'm really, really enjoying it.

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.027
I don't care about the cold.

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.729
They must be enjoying too.
They're seeing the same stars.

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:26.964
[Jimin] I hope so.

00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:33.871
AN UNFORGETTABLE NIGHT FOR EVERYONE

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:43.147
Jimin, this is crazy.

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:44.648
This shot is crazy.

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.983
So pretty.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.685
[Jimin] You're even giving us fire?

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:51.155
-[Jimin] I'm flustered.
-Isn't this too cute?

00:49:51.222 --> 00:49:52.623
[Jimin sighs]

00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:56.494
It's nice.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.862
[sighs]

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.830
This is how we heal again.

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:04.368
-Are You Sure?! is always right.
-They were right.

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:06.303
-Yeah, always right.
-Always.

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.039
I want to keep doing this show.

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:10.508
Except America, maybe?

00:50:11.876 --> 00:50:14.011
-That was really for you.
-Really.

00:50:14.645 --> 00:50:17.081
I lean, and I see only half the stars.

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:20.618
Sing a song with the lyrics.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.653

I LEAN, AND I SEE ONLY HALF THE STARS

00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:35.399

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:37.401
It'd be nice to see another shooting star.

00:50:37.468 --> 00:50:39.236
ONCE LAST SHOOTING STAR BEFORE LEAVING

00:50:39.303 --> 00:50:40.304
HELLO. MEOW

00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.372
It's a cat.

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:43.541
-What?
-A cat is here.

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:46.644
It's amazing
that we're meeting a cat like this.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.647
What was your nickname? Blue mold?

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.749
-[Jimin] Mmm.
-Calico cat?

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.050
-Calico cat.
-Calico cat?

00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:54.685
The cat came to you.

00:50:54.752 --> 00:50:56.086
You shouldn't touch it.

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:57.521
I'll wash my hands later.

00:50:57.588 --> 00:51:00.257
I have cat allergies,
so I don't want to have one.

00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:02.226
-Yeah.
-But strangely, cats come to me.

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:03.861
That's fate.

00:51:03.928 --> 00:51:06.430
But it's cute
that the cat came to the fire.

00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:07.498
Come here.

00:51:07.565 --> 00:51:09.366
TRYING TO TALK TO THE CAT

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.035
HELLO. COME HERE.

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.404
IS IT WORKING?

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.039
[laughing]

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.106
Cute.

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:19.643
How can a cat be so gentle?

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:23.280
SWISS CAT STICKING CLOSE TO CALICO CAT

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:24.582
What are you looking for?

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.617
INFINITE BUTT PATS

00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:28.352
Cats like butt pats.

FOND MEMORIES PLUS A SWISS CAT
THANKS TO THE STARS

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.993
So cute. Is it here because it's cold?

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.762
I'M LEAVING. MEOW.

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:40.497
[Jung Kook chuckles]

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:42.366
It's so nice.

SWITZERLAND, NIGHT SKY,
GLASS OF WHISKEY, TORCH, AND A CAT

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:50.274
I think it's my first time gazing at stars
and fire at the same time.

00:51:50.341 --> 00:51:53.844
Wow. Hey, that star
has green and red light.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:55.846
That's a meteorite.

00:51:56.714 --> 00:51:57.982
Wow.

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.516
It's a UFO.

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:02.086
[Jimin] It's a UFO. It's a flying saucer.

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:04.588
[Jung Kook] They're here to get us.

00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:05.723
[moaning]

00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:07.958

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:09.827
[Jung Kook] They're coming! No!

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:12.463
[moaning]

00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:14.531
They're coming!

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:27.645
AFTER A NIGHT OF BRILLIANT STARLIGHT

THE 6TH MORNING IN ZERMATT
THE GOLDEN MATTERHORN GREETS THEM

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:34.218
CURRENT TIME: 10:00 AM

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.120
Just rock-paper-scissors, one round?

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:38.088
One round. I'm playing rock.

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:39.390
I'm playing rock too.

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:41.525
[director] Here we go.
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:52:41.592 --> 00:52:42.726
JUNG KOOK WINS

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.095
Well done!

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.264
DECIDED TO WAKE UP AT 10:00!

00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:49.933
-We're waking up at 10 tomorrow.
-At 10:00!

00:52:51.235 --> 00:52:53.737
STAFF COMING TO WAKE THEM AT 10:00 SHARP

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:55.339
[director] Jung Kook.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.913
MUMBLING

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.149
Have breakfast.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.383
Yes.

00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:08.752
[groans softly]

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.923
What time did you go to bed last night?

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:18.162
JUNG KOOK - UNTRANSLATABLE LANGUAGE

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:19.296
Wake up.

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:24.368
GIVING UP ON TRANSLATION,
STAFF MEMBER LEAVES

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:29.740
BACK TO DREAMLAND

00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:32.042
STAFF HEADING TO SECOND TARGET

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:36.680
JIMIN'S ALREADY AWAKE

00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:38.749
Hello.

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:41.385
Good morning.

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:44.221
-Did you sleep well?
-I slept really well.

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:45.456
Okay, let's go.

00:53:46.123 --> 00:53:47.524
Where?

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.329
Since you slept well, let's go.

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:53.831
GO AWAY

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:00.304
-Jung Kook...
-Yes.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.939
...hasn't woken up yet.

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.073
He's up.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.408
-What?
-He's up.

00:54:04.475 --> 00:54:10.314
LET'S GO

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:15.652
JIMIN HAS WOKEN UP

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:20.090
HE'S ALREADY UP
AND HAVING BREAKFAST WITH BEDHEAD

00:54:21.058 --> 00:54:24.762
SATISFIED NODDING

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:26.730
[in English] Goodbye, Zermatt.

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.802
[in Korean] I need to know
where we're going to say hello.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.477
LET'S JUST EAT FOR NOW

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:42.713
[sighs] Delicious.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.984
JIMIN APPEARS

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.887
-How have you been?
-I've been good.

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:53.724
CAREFULLY CHOOSING JAM

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:54.958
My whole body hurts.

00:54:56.193 --> 00:55:00.397
SEVERE AFTERMATH OF SKIING

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:03.967
SOMEONE'S JUST ENJOYING THE FOOD

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.135
Avocados?

00:55:05.202 --> 00:55:06.970
HIS INTEREST: AVOCADO

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.972
Avocados are so good for you.

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:10.407
Good fat.

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.076
-Oh, this is fat?
-Yeah.

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:16.814
FIRST BITE OF GOOD FAT

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.650
HEARTILY SPREADING BUTTER ON BREAD

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:20.751
Butter is...

00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:22.419
Smooth like butter.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.087
Is it bad fat?

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.991
I guess. Because it's delicious.

00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:34.131
SUDDENLY HEARING STAFF'S VOICES
(BOILED EGGS)

00:55:34.198 --> 00:55:35.265
What?

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:37.201
LAUGHING

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:40.204
-Did I buy boiled eggs?
-[director] Aren't these boiled eggs?

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.840
Doesn't it mean
we could also eat them like that?

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.075
[director] Let's test it then.

00:55:45.142 --> 00:55:47.644
Rock-paper-scissors
and smack it on the forehead.

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.513
-It's a raw egg.
-A raw one?

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.681
DEFINITELY A RAW EGG

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.182
Cook the eggs, Jimin.

00:55:52.249 --> 00:55:54.551
-You want it?
-Breakfast should have eggs.

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:55.853
Okay, wait.

00:55:57.087 --> 00:56:00.123
Season with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.226
Season with salt and pepper and what?

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.027
I've never done that.

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.898
WATCHING

00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:09.766
-Look ahead.
-What is it?

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.369
CUSTOMER BANNED FROM WATCHING

00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:14.838
Where's olive oil? Here?

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:18.742
Wait, I need butter to make it smooth.

00:56:18.809 --> 00:56:21.278
Right, better with butter.

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:25.148
-Smooth like butter.
-Like butter.

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.017
HE MEANT EATING BUTTER

00:56:27.084 --> 00:56:30.787
♪ I can't eat flour ♪

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:34.224
TOO MUCH SOULFUL EARLY IN THE MORNING

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:35.826
How do you want it?

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:39.296
I want it sunny side up, please.

00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:40.998
-Fully cooked?
-Sunny side up.

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:43.333
Sunny side up?

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.670
Yeah. Would that be hard?

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:50.507
Have I ever gotten sunny side up right?

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:53.477
How about scrambled eggs?

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.846
-No, sunny side up.
-Okay.

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.715
I'm nervous.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:02.953
My biggest challenge... on this trip.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.088
Needs lots of oil, right?

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.156
[Jung Kook] Yes.

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:09.693
-[Jimin] You don't like frying it?
-That's right.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.428
Is this right?

00:57:11.495 --> 00:57:13.297
CHECK AND DOUBLE

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:18.101
SPREADING OIL EVENLY

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.637
Season well with salt and pepper.

00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:22.372
That's another issue.

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.808
How about adding that after it's done?

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:26.043
Is that not good?

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:27.811
What?

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.314
I'll do it on low heat.

00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:33.283
Medium-low heat is better for fried eggs.

00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:36.219
Medium-low heat. Perfect.

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:40.390
FIRST EGG DROPPED

00:57:41.358 --> 00:57:43.493
SECOND EGG IS ALSO SUCCESSFUL

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.128
[Jung Kook] Looking forward to it.

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:48.665
When you cut the yolk, it flows out.

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:51.401
Richly flowing down.

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.370
You know?

00:57:53.437 --> 00:57:54.504
You know what I mean?

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:57.074
SO BUSY SMELLING THAT HE CAN'T HEAR

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.544
SHAKING

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.312
LET'S SEE

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.782
What are you doing?

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:06.984
I found salt.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.585
We have salt?

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:10.320
SPRINKLING SALT WITH HIS MOUTH

00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.289
COMING OUT NOW

00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:15.359
PEPPER TOO

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:18.562
SECOND BATTLE WITH OIL AFTER LAST NIGHT

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:21.765
Jimin, do you have a problem with oil?

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:23.900
[imitates splattering]

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:27.637
When Jimin cooks, the food gets angry.

00:58:28.472 --> 00:58:30.807
GROWLING

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.342
COMING OUT OF CURIOSITY

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:34.644
What? The egg's shape is interesting.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.747
-[Jimin] It's like a croissant.
-Croissant.

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.383
Jung Kook, it's almost done.

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.219
Right. It looks so delicious.

00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:45.589
This is the best egg I've made in my life.

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:46.857
-Really?
-Yes.

00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:49.626
Taking it out is hard, too.

00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:51.228
ENDLESS HARDSHIP

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:55.198
GETTING LESS CONFIDENT NOW THAT IT'S DONE

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:59.569
CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THE YOLK

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:01.638
JIMIN'S FRIED EGG IS FINALLY COMPLETE

00:59:01.705 --> 00:59:04.975
-Jung Kook, this one will taste better.
-Understood.

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.244
-You did well.
-Really?

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.813
You did well.

00:59:10.514 --> 00:59:12.482
You need ketchup with the eggs, right?

00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:13.650
That's right.

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:17.120
A fried egg made by Jimin.

00:59:17.187 --> 00:59:19.456
[Jimin humming]

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:21.124
SAVORING WITH HIS FOREHEAD

00:59:21.191 --> 00:59:22.726
-Jimin.
-Yes.

00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:25.729
Very crispy. The bottom is crispy.

00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:27.197
-This is so delicious.
-Good.

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.399
[Jimin] I'll put some here.

00:59:29.466 --> 00:59:30.534
[Jung Kook] Thank you.

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.702
-Amazing.
-Good.

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:35.439
Gosh, we need rice now.
Jimin, can you make rice?

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.107
At the next place.

00:59:37.174 --> 00:59:39.943
Hold that egg in your mouth
and eat it with rice then.

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:43.413
PERFECT COMBO BITE INSTEAD OF RICE

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.483
CHEF FINALLY TAKES A BITE

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.617
Mmm.

00:59:48.018 --> 00:59:50.554
What should I eat this yolk with?

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.056
I'm torn.

00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:54.124
VERY BIG CONCERN

00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:55.792
You know what?

00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:57.994
-I'll put this on it.
-Okay.

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.162
And then...

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.032
IN ONE BITE

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.502
EVERY LAST PIECE

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:07.104
I'm going to make a sandwich.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.171
CROISSANT SANDWICH

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.541
Because Jimin made it
in the shape of a croissant,

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.243
I'll take a croissant...

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.512
and put some on it.

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:18.448
EGG CROISSANT SANDWICH
1. CUT CROISSANT IN HALF

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:21.751
2. PUT THEM TOGETHER AND PRESS FLAT

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.087
3. PLACE JIMIN'S FRIED EGG ON ONE SIDE

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.289
4. ADD HAM AND CHEESE

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.991
5. ADD KETCHUP AND BUTTER

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.260
6. COVER IT WITH THE OTHER HALF

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:35.332
DELICIOUS BITE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.834
CHEF IS VERY SATISFIED

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:41.238
LOST IN THE EGG CROISSANT

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.807
VERY SATISFIED

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.842
-This is good.
-That's good.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:49.846
I'll dip it like this in the yolk.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.317
I think people in other countries
will follow the recipe.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.053
I feel like it'll become a meme.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:01.491
Eating it the way Jung Kook ate it.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.793
-He says it's good.
-Wait! Avocado!

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.162
DISCOVERS FORGOTTEN AVOCADO

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.997
And they'll copy this too.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.331
RECOMMENDS ADDING AVOCADO

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.933
When you have one bite left...

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.935
-Yes.
-...you find the avocado.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:16.039
It was too heavy, but the avocado
makes it less heavy.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:17.707
It changes to a luxurious taste.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.376
Luxurious fattening taste?

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:22.445
IF IT'S DELICIOUS,
IT'S ZERO CALORIES, YOU KNOW?

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:26.416
ENJOYING EVEN THE LAST BITE

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.251
Eating it like this is really good.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:30.420
Looks really delicious.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.658
IT'S NOT SOUP, IT'S MILK

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.560
FINISHED ALL OF HIS BREAKFAST

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.794
Thank you for the meal.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.629
I should shampoo,

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.431
wash my face, and brush my teeth.

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:45.001
PREPARING TO LEAVE

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:52.676
JIMIN'S READY FIRST

01:01:54.911 --> 01:02:01.017
JUNG KOOK FOLLOWS HIM OUT

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.319
Shall we go now?

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.954
-Yes.
-Let's go.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.156
Embarrassing.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.794
TRAIN RIDE
FERRY RIDE

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.163
HOT TUG, DINNER, GAMES

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.667
-[Jimin] We're taking this?
-Yes.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.837
MOVING TO TRAIN STATION VIA TAXI

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.573
I should've slept early.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.342
I was on my phone.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.912
I fell asleep after watching
a Shin-chan short.

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:30.280
Shin-chan short!

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.783
-I did it wrong.
-I'm wrong!

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:39.055
NOTHING TO SAY SINCE HE STARTED IT

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:41.858
-I did it wrong.
-I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.794
Mirror therapy is the answer.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.796
Mirror therapy!

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:51.134
SCRATCHING

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.771
HEADING TO THE TRAIN STATION

01:02:55.939 --> 01:03:00.010
TAKING IN ZERMATT ONE LAST TIME

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:03.580
CAUTION: TOO BRIGHT

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.715
Too much sunlight.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.118
Vitamin D is exploding.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:10.420
Vitamin explosion!

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:13.790
Mirror therapy properly.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.125
WILL BE FULLY CURED TODAY

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.394
RUNNING TO THE TRAIN STATION

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.096
[Jung Kook] Wow, everyone, good morning.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:25.035
Let's make it an energetic day
today as well.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.371
We're not late today, are we?
I feel relaxed.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.206
ENJOYING LEISURE THANKS TO HURRYING

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.643
ARRIVED AT TRAIN STATION

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.512
[Jimin] The train's arrived, Jung Kook.

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.548
WHERE WILL THE NEXT DESTINATION BE?

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.051
GOING STRAIGHT FIRST

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:44.154
-Do you know where we're going?
-The 12:06 one.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.221
Ah.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.590
PLANNING TO TAKE THIS TRAIN

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.159
IT'S JUNG KOOK

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:55.932
NO IDEA

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.901
Jimin left me behind.

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:00.704
Hey, cute one.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.406
JUNG KOOK STOPPED TO LOOK AT A CUTE DOG

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:05.809
What about Jung Kook?

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.411
REALIZING JUNG KOOK'S
DISAPPEARANCE MUCH LATER

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.948
Reunion.

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.184
Where is it?

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.152
Not here.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:20.323
All right. I've arrived at the train.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:21.925
Should I go inside?

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:22.992
LOOKING FOR HIS SEAT

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.060
That's it.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:25.595
JUNG KOOK SAFELY ARRIVED

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:29.265
I'm here.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.373
-Entering. Hello.
-[man] Hello.

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.209
Jimin, nice to see you.

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.310
Nice to see you.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.778
NICE TO SEE YOU INDEED

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.616
[Jung Kook] So where's
the next destination?

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.118
It's written there. No?

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.621
-We'll give you an address.
-Okay.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:53.556
-Check the address.
-Okay.

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:56.659
Transfer if necessary and go to the place.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.194
-On our own?
-Yes.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.396
Shall we go?

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:05.135
TODAY'S TRAVEL CONCEPT:
FIND DESTINATION ON YOUR OWN

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.369
Oh, we got the address.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.205
-We did? Let's see.
-Yeah.

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:10.974
The address is... What?

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.876
A place called 633.

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:16.012
-We need to get off at Visp here.
-Right.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.547
-Right?
-Yeah.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.549
It takes quite a while.

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:21.918
-Spiez.
-Spiez.

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:23.420
[Jimin] Transfer.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:26.923
Interlaken Ost.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.358
Transfer there.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.593
[Jung Kook] Then keep going, right?

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.995
-Yeah.
-We can take IC6.

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.463
And then...

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.432
-What? IC6?
-Yes.

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.267
Mine says IC8.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.536
Why are you cursing?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:44.507
DON'T GET HIM WRONG.
IT'S THE ACTUAL TRAIN NAME.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:46.209
No, I'm saying it shows IC8.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.678
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:51.948
Look at this here. It's right there.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.950
We need to take IC8 from here.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:57.253
But mine says IC6.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.521
Must be similar.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.024
-Right.
-If you refresh in real time.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.959
-Must be the same.
-Yeah.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.595
Let's get off at Visp.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.432
[director] Anyway, we have
quite a lot of staff members.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:12.469
-Fifteen people are moving together.
-Yes.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.904
[director] You have to lead everyone well.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:15.972
Us?

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.440
MUST SAFELY LEAD STAFF TOO

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.542
Aren't you all adults?

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.945
LAUGHING

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.648
-They're not kids.
-[Jung Kook] Exactly.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.351
They're all adults,

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.987
so it's okay to get left behind.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:33.490
They can catch up later.

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.959
JUNG KOOK ALWAYS MAKES SENSE

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.528
EVERYONE'S AN ADULT,
BUT LET'S ALL GO TOGETHER

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.129
TIME TO ENJOY PICTURESQUE SCENERY

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.065
[Jung Kook] Mountains are really high.

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.834
By the way,
the train runs so smoothly. No?

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:47.136
-Yeah, I think so too.
-Right?

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:51.941
You know, on railroad tracks,
there's wood between the metal.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.811
Do you know why it's wood?

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.213
-I know.
-Why is it?

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:01.050
The tracks are made of metal, right?

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.453
-Yes.
-When it receives heat,

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.989
it can expand and bend.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.056
Okay.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.425
But the wood in the middle,

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.929
if it were metal,
the shape would change drastically.

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:13.997
Okay.

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.365
Right?

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.799
I asked because I didn't know.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.736
Really? I was just guessing too.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:21.337
NEITHER OF THEM KNOWS

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.506
-[Jung Kook] But I think you're right.
-Right?

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.408
IN ANY CASE, IT WAS A VALUABLE TIME

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:30.346
THE TRAIN KEEPS RUNNING
THROUGH SWISS NATURE

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.750
ARRIVED AT VISP,
THEIR FIRST TRANSFER STATION

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.085
This is our first transfer station.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.487
A PICTURE BEFORE GETTING OFF

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.823
GETTING PUMPED BEFORE GETTING OFF

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.626
Let's go. We need to get ready to get off.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.862
NERVOUS FOR NO REASON

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:46.930
Let's go down.

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:49.265
Let's board quickly.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.602
-We're IC6, okay?
-Okay.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.605
DOOR OPEN

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.374
LET'S SEE

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.376
Let's go down the stairs first.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.312
[Jimin] Let's go down here.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.213
[man in English] A ramp over there.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.381
[Jimin] This way.

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:09.218
We only have seven minutes left.

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.353
Should we run?

01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:15.458
Hold on. Where should we go?
I think we should go to the fifth floor.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.629
TRACK 4 - 7

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:23.366
FOLLOWING THE SIGNS

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:27.070
EYES SEARCHING FOR IC6 NON-STOP

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:28.738
Where is it?

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:29.973
CONFUSION - CHAOS

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:31.741
Just look for IC.

01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:34.210
Isn't it there?

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:35.311
That's it, right?

01:08:35.378 --> 01:08:37.146
-In the middle.
-In the middle?

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.683
No, this is five and four.
We need to go that way.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.051
That's seven and six.

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:44.354
Yeah, here.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.688
FINALLY FOUND IC6

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:46.990
There's C here.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.428
STOPPING

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.563
Is this right?

01:08:56.032 --> 01:09:01.137
CAREFULLY CHECKING TRAIN INFORMATION BOARD

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.207
PERFECT MATCH

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.475
Is everyone here?

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.609
CHECKING ON STAFF

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.811
-We can go, Jung Kook.
-Let's go.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:10.780
Let's go up now.

01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:15.151
PEACE OF MIND RETURNED
AFTER THEY FOUND THE TRANSFER GATE

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:18.321
[Jung Kook] You can just hold here.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:21.624
SMART BUT CLUMSY...
CLUMSY BUT COOL...

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:23.559
Here, here.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.361
TOO EARLY TO RELAX

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.363
What is it?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.165
This one. On our right.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:31.501
We need to go to number one.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.736
-What?
-Our seats.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.905
We have a minute before departure.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:37.874
Let's just board then.

01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:39.942
This must be it, right?

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.278
Just board.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.147
-Just board.
-Just board.

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:45.348
-Don't know.
-Don't know.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:46.716
Whatever.

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:47.850
Just board.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.586
BOARDED SUCCESSFULLY

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:51.854
[Jimin] Where is it?

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.357
Whatever. Let's just board.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:55.892
THE PATH I TAKE IS THE ANSWER

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.627
Jung Kook's just going in?

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.230
Perfect.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:03.399
JUNG KOOK SUCCESSFULLY SEATED

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:04.934
I don't know either.

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:07.136
WHATEVER

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.907
-The air conditioner's working.
-I don't know. We can sit anywhere, right?

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.544
-No?
-We're VIPs, so it doesn't matter, right?

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.746
That's right. Don't worry.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:20.383
Everyone, I'll guide you safely.
Directors.

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.318
MOVING TO SPIEZ STATION

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.054
This time, we just need to get to Spiez.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.491
That's the next station.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:29.792
What?

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.628
-That's right. It takes 26 minutes.
-Yes.

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:33.696
Good, good.

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.198
GAINED 26 MINUTES OF REST TIME

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.533
RELIEVED

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.837
We're going to Interlaken now.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.873
In about 40 minutes...

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.143
we'll transfer to another train...

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.080
and then walk to the destination.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.082
How many minutes left?

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.085
It's... Nine minutes.

01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:58.354
-Nine minutes?
-Yes.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.455
Yep.

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.726
WHILE ENJOYING SWISS SCENERY,
NINE MINUTES FLY BY

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.063
-[director] Listen.
-Yes?

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.932
The train tracks to Interlaken
have been broken.

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:14.203
Let's get off as soon as possible.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.271
Okay.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:16.773
-We'll get out?
-[director] Yes.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:19.308
What? Why is it broken?

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.376
It can't be helped.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.979
TRYING TO STAY CALM

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.782
-We just needed to transfer once.
-[Jung Kook] I know, right?

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.750
DISAPPOINTED

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:28.985
Let's go.

01:11:30.186 --> 01:11:31.254
Let's go.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.823
[Jung Kook] I got caught in it.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.691
-[Jimin] Must get our suitcases.
-Right.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.560
-Up there.
-You put it up there?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:41.931
NOT FORGETTING TO GET THE LUGGAGE

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.332
Broken, broken.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:47.470
So, what do we do now?
Should we take a bus?

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.405
STEPPING OUTSIDE

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:50.606
This place is pretty.

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:54.177
Our fate. Oh, it's so bright here.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:57.847
THEY GOT HERE BY CHANCE, BUT IT'S PRETTY

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.982
From Interlaken to Spiez...

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.618
There's a ferry.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:05.955
Looks like it operates on that lake.

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:07.089
JIMIN FOUND A FERRY

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.592
Spiez Lake Thun... Is it that one?

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.596
JIMIN'S CHOICE
LAKE THUN FERRY

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.299
LAKE THUN FERRY
SWISS PUBLIC TRANSPORT

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.367
DEPARTING FROM INTERLAKEN

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:22.805
LIKE A BUS, YOU CAN GET ON AND OFF
AT EVERY DOCK

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:23.873
Oh!

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:26.709
-Hold on.
-There's one.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.878
This one, the 3:28 one.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:32.348
Then how about we eat first?

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:34.784
-There's a restaurant nearby.
-Okay. Let's go.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.353
Here. Let's go. Let's walk there.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.089
ONE HOUR UNTIL DEPARTURE
LET'S FILL OUR STOMACHS FIRST

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.457
Let's go down.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.794
LET'S GO EAT!

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.330
Let's take a ferry.

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.497
OUR ONLY HOPE IS A FERRY

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.434
Let's just take a ferry.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.636
-There's shade here. Shade!
-Hey.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.938
-On our right.
-Shade!

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.006
Come into the shade.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:58.307
CHECKING ON THE STAFF

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:00.576
Let's go!

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.679
This is what traveling is.

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:05.181
UNPREDICTABLE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:06.382
Go straight, right?

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.785
Just go straight this way. Straight.

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:11.687
It's hot.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.422
MAX TEMPERATURE: 29 DEGREES

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.157
I'd do anything for a bicycle.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.994
I want a scooter so bad.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.595
SCOOTER PASSING BY

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.499
I want a bike like that even more.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:26.502
-How about renting a motorcycle?
-A motorcycle?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.037
What about the luggage?

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:31.841
Let's just go.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.411
We're almost there.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:40.750
COMING ACROSS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:44.754
That building is pretty too.
What could it be? A church? A castle?

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.924
Oh! It's Spiez Castle.

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:49.792
It's really pretty.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:50.860
IT'S SPIEZ CASTLE

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.628
I want to live in a place like that.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:56.232
It's so nice. It's pretty. It really is.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.601
-Where is it?
-Over there.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:00.403
-Do we need to go inside?
-Yes.

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.671
We're almost here.

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.540
[in English] Okay. I got it. I understand.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.642
TODAY'S JOURNEY
MUST BE A BIT TOUGH FOR HIM

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:08.711
The water is pretty.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.579
Why is this place so pretty?

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.948
EVERYTHING'S PRETTY IN SPIEZ

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.583
Isn't this place insane as well?
Wow, this is so pretty.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.285
What a beautiful place!

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:20.389
FINALLY ARRIVING AT DOCK
AFTER GOING THROUGH BEAUTIFUL SCENERY

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.590
[Jung Kook] I can breathe now.

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:24.493
COOLING OFF FOR A MOMENT

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.897
[in Korean] It was hot when we were
walking, but the sun hid a bit now.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.165
Wow, look at the clouds.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:33.836
AFTER STOPPING, THEY CAN FINALLY SEE
THE BEAUTIFUL SKIES OVER SPIEZ

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:35.271
Hey, let's go get hot dogs.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.940
-We have to eat hot dogs.
-They looked good.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.275
For eight francs,

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.945
they give you one with two sausages.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:44.013
What?

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.382
The most expensive hot dog.

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:47.950
-The eight-franc one?
-Yeah.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.919
No, it'll be too salty.

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:52.588
No, I want to eat that.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.756
Too salty.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.158
WHAT?

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.693
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Okay.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.029
-Best of three?
-No, one round.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.964
-One round? You won't regret it?
-No.

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:03.466
-No?
-You think I'll regret it?

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.835
Wow, you're going to lose.

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.336
One round? Loser pays.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.505
Rock-paper-scissors.

01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:12.041
TIE

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:14.043
WHY IS THIS SO NERVE-RACKING?

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:15.177
Rock-paper-scissors.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.979
JIMIN WINS

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:19.115
UGH

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:20.249
Go get it.

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:27.323
JUNG KOOK GOING TO ORDER HOT DOG

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.226
I just lost half of my stamina.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.528
RELIEVED

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:34.597
What's the expensive one?

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:35.765
ENTERING HOT DOG SHOP

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.333
LOOKING FOR WHAT JIMIN MENTIONED

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.667
No, these are drinks.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:44.540
FOUND HOT DOG MENU

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.776
[in English] Two double, please.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.144
-[cashier] Two?
-Yeah.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.281
[in Korean] Wait, it's nine francs.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:55.351
IT'S TOO MUCH

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.621
DESPITE THE PRICE,
JUNG KOOK BOUGHT IT FOR JIMIN

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:00.356
TWO SAUSAGES

01:16:00.423 --> 01:16:01.490
Enjoy your meal.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.926
This looks more delicious,
so I'll eat this one.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.495
[Jimin] Why didn't you
buy the same one?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.763
I ordered the same one.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.932
-Oh, really? I see.
-Yes.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:11.534
Mine's double too.

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.570
But somehow yours has more stuff in it.

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:16.338
-Should I give you some of it?
-No.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.475
What? They made it crispy.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:22.611
HOW DOES THE DOUBLE HOT DOG TASTE
IN SPIEZ? - CRISPY

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:24.447
Mmm!

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.583
CRISPY

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.254
FOREHEAD SAYS IT ALL

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:33.923
[Jimin] Mmm.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.758
Okay, take it and eat comfortably.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.127
READY

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.429
DIGGING IN

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:43.499
TAKING A BIG BITE

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:47.503
HUNGRILY GOBBLING

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.772
You came after the smell, huh?

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.174
Who came?

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.678
SPIEZ NEIGHBORHOOD BOSS, 'SPARROW'

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:57.613
HERE IT IS

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:00.983
[Jung Kook] You like it?
You're eating well.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:02.985
Good bird.

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:09.125
JUNG KOOK ALSO STARTS INHALING HOT DOG

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:13.929
QUITE A SATISFYING MEAL

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.264
The bread is good.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:24.073
HE WANTED TO SAY THE HOT DOG BREAD
IS DELICIOUS AND WELL-TOASTED

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:28.244
ENJOYING EVERY LAST BITE

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:36.785
CHEEKS FULL

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:39.054
VERY SATISFYING MEAL

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:41.123
[Jimin] This is so good.
I want one more.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:44.860
BEAUTIFUL SPIEZ AND DELICIOUS FOOD
ANOTHER UNFORGETTABLE MEMORY

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.897
THE FERRY HAS ARRIVED

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:50.032
[Jimin] Shall we board the ferry?

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:53.169
[singing]

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.538
[singing]

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.107
[singing]

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:03.345
NOW THAT HE'S BOARDING THE FERRY,
HE'S IN A GOOD MOOD

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.648
There are a lot of people.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:08.517
CROWDED DUE TO TRACK BREAKDOWN

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.386
There really are a lot of people.

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.389
SUCCESSFULLY BOARDED
WE'RE TAKING A FERRY

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:19.628
[Jimin] Look at the color.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.199
HI THERE

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:25.467
It's cool.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.503
-It's cool.
-Can we just stand like this?

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.138
LOOKING AROUND THE FERRY

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:32.141
It's nice and cool. God, I can breathe.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.443
PLANNING TO ENJOY LAKE THUN COOLLY

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.914
IS IT COMING OUT WELL?

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.218
[Jung Kook] Ahh. I can breathe.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.820
WE'RE HEADING TO INTERLAKEN NOW

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.057
ENJOYING THE SCENERY

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:51.527
AMAZED

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:55.864
[Jimin] So beautiful.

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:59.268
TAKING IN THE SCENERY OF LAKE THUN
WITH THEIR EYES

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.707
JUNG KOOK COMPLETELY CAPTIVATED
BY LAKE THUN

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.742
Wow.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.779
This is good. This is nice.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:12.781
[Jimin] Upstairs is good.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:15.551
But it feels like it might rain.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.654
CLOUDY LAKE THUN
MAKES THEM EVEN MORE SENTIMENTAL

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:21.357
But wouldn't the rain here be clean?

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.127
Walking around in the rain here
would be really nice.

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:28.197
When else would we get rained on?

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:33.135
SWISS MAGIC THAT TURNS
EVEN CLOUDY WEATHER INTO ROMANCE

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.904
ENJOYING PRETTY SCENERY...

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.210
WHAT?

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:44.480
THEN ACTING CUTE ON CAMERA

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.983
What, are you acting cute?

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.051
No.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:52.421
HE'S ADORABLE

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:53.555
Shall we go down now?

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.124
LET'S GO DOWN

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.258
No.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.660
You want to be downstairs?

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.528
No, there's no place to sit here.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.764
Then go downstairs.
I'll stay here a bit longer.

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.998
Okay, I'll go down.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.067
DECIDING TO STAY DOWNSTAIRS

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.603
I'll come up if it's hot.
I should order a beer.

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:09.772
Wait, with our money?

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:12.975
It's hot.

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:20.182
JUNG KOOK, WHO SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
ABOUT TO DRINK BEER ON THE 1ST FLOOR

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:22.384
YAWNING

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:33.662
HE MUST HAVE BEEN TIRED.
HE FELL ASLEEP.

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:36.799
It's not that cool now,
so I want to go down.

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:39.435
JIMIN EVENTUALLY GOES DOWN

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.669
It's not cool upstairs.

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:42.371
[woman] It's really hot downstairs.

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:43.439
Oh, really?

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:44.640
NEWS: FIRST FLOOR IS HOT

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:46.241
Did Jung Kook buy beer?

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:47.343
[woman] He's sleeping.

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:49.411
How does he sleep?

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:52.348
LIKE THIS?

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:58.187
JIMIN HAS COME OUT
TO THE 1ST FLOOR OUTDOOR AREA

01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.688
This is much better.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:01.724
Pretty.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.930
We were there.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.801
We were over there. We've come so far.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.672
This lake is huge.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.274
It's this big, but it's not the ocean.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:23.879
JUNG KOOK IN DEEP SLEEP

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.148
STARTLED

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.389
It's hot.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.758
It's so hot.

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:41.597
JUNG KOOK ALSO GOES TO WHERE JIMIN IS

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.432
-[Jimin] Did you sleep a bit?
-Yeah.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:44.967
I woke up because it's hot.

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.034
FOUND COMFORT AGAIN

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.403
It's like a sauna.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:48.971
I feel so hot.

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:04.052
FRIENDLY SHOULDER HUG

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.687
FRIENDLY SHOULDER HUG???

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.822
Smells good, right?

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:11.493
PASSED OUT WITH EYES OPEN

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.630
-It's huge.
-Huh?

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:16.665
It's huge.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:20.002
The color of the water
is prettier on the other side.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.069
What?

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.739
There are birds flying over there.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.874
This side is pretty too.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.310
[man] Go to the other side.

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:30.179
The other side? Are there seats?

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.447
[man] We saved seats.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.514
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:34.483
MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:38.887
WHO IS HE GREETING?

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.123
That baby is so cute.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:48.430
How long are you going to wave for?
How long?

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.034
So cute. He must be a little kid.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.571
We have to get off at the next stop.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.240
I know. We'll go through the river now.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:02.177
I wonder how clean the water must be
to look like this.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:04.179
A lot of people get off here.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.248
This must be a good place.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:12.254
EMERALD COLORED LAKE THU
WAS FORMED BY MELTED GLACIERS

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:16.692
THE WATER IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR,
AND MANY PEOPLE ENJOY WATER ACTIVITIES

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.594
Should we swim during the day?

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.096
That dog is so cute.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:22.664
So excited.

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:23.966
-Retriever?
-Yeah.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:27.236
-Its steps show how excited it is.
-Yes.

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:29.471
SO EXCITED, WOOF!

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:31.974
That dog really doesn't listen.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.375
So excited.

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:36.078
WE'LL BE THIS EXCITED SOON TOO

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:38.347
Its butt went in the water.
It's excited now.

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.683
-It refused at first.
-Because it's cool.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.652
Then it realized how cool it was.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.020
[Jung Kook] It's so excited.

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:46.288
[Jimin] It's going crazy.

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:48.390
That video was really funny.

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:50.092
Retrievers are dumb, apparently.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:53.128
Right. A thief came in,
and it played with him.

01:23:53.829 --> 01:23:56.164
They're actually really smart,

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.499
but dumb at the same time.

01:23:57.566 --> 01:23:59.701
-Is that RM?
-Right.

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:02.471
Dumb dog.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:06.208
ONLY RM WILL FEEL FOREVER WRONGED

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:08.210
Seems like we're going that way.

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:09.745
INTERLAKEN DOCK COMING INTO VIEW

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.614
Let's go get ready to get off.

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:15.384
-[Jung Kook] Let's get off.
-Wow, it's so pretty.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.185
The final stop is so pretty too.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.554
Let's go.

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.122
[Jimin] That was tough.

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:21.823
We're in Interlaken.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.860
Since the train tracks were broken,

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:26.995
we had to take a ferry.

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:30.032
We were supposed to arrive
an hour and a half ago.

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.099
I know.

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.834
Our tour car is here.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.902
[Jimin laughs]

01:24:33.969 --> 01:24:36.305
-Buddy.
-Buddy, you were waiting.

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:38.340
Oh, this is good.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.108
Feels good. It's been a while.

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:41.944
Let's go.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.412
Turn on the air conditioner.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.181
POWER COOLING ON IMMEDIATELY

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.382
This is so cool.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.685
Right, it's so thrilling right now.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.853
We're going to Brienz Lake now, right?

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.122
-Our first... Yes.
-Destination.

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.958
Thirty minutes? It's close.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.128
SETTING OFF TO BRIENZ RIGHT AWAY

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.130
Hey, this is so pretty here too.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.333
Each city has a different feel.

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.835
A CITY WITH A DIFFERENT AMBIENCE
FROM SPIEZ

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.973
LOCATED BETWEEN
LAKE THUN AND LAKE BRIENZ

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:15.043
A CITY FULL OF TRAVELERS' ENERGY

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:19.481
INTERLAKEN

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:21.717
-It's so nice because it's cool.
-Yes.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.119
[Jimin] Nice being in this car again
after a while.

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:25.621
[Jung Kook] I can breathe now.

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:28.824
DRIVING WITH THE AC ON
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:32.661
[Jimin] You know what?
I really like these roundabouts.

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.296
We don't have to stop.

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:36.898
Yes, the encircling never stops.
It's so great.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:41.236
You know what they introduced.
Roads that never have traffic jams.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.373
They're all like this. Roundabouts.

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:46.575
And the way they yield is great.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.444
-One car passes, then another passes.
-Right.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:52.781
So as long as you yield
to those already in the circle...

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:53.849
Right.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.418
OUT OF THE CITY CENTER

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.987
IT STARTS DRIZZLING

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:02.024
The lake here is so nice too.

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:04.760
This place feels kind of different.

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:08.897
-But this city seems to go well with rain.
-[Jimin] Right.

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.099
[Jung Kook] Damp like this.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.902
[Jimin] Isn't the color
suddenly a bit different too?

01:26:13.969 --> 01:26:15.404
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Right?

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.572
-[Jimin] Roof colors are different too.
-Yes.

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:20.942
[Jung Kook] Less flashy,
but deep and soft.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.879
-Yes. Should I say the colors blend well?
-[Jung Kook] Right.

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.914
-[Jimin] So charming.
-Definitely different.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:27.249
Brienz

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:30.385
The roof colors
are just so good right now.

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:32.087
[humming]

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:34.222
Ji-seg-ddak-nuh-jot.

01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:35.624
What?

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.026
"The colors right now are just so good"?

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.429
HERE HE GOES AGAIN...

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.697
King Sejong!

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:43.632
I'm sorry!

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:46.101
My little brother is immature.

01:26:46.168 --> 01:26:47.769
FINDING IT SO FUNNY

01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:50.439
I started it. I'm sorry.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.973
Si-jeo-jae!

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:58.814
[Jung Kook] The rain's getting heavier.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.048
RAIN GETTING HEAVIER

01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:04.953
You know, we can only see
the trees and the lake here.

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.855
It really looks like a movie scene.

01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:08.924
Yeo-jin-jang?

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.560
THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:14.262
Why do you sound so weak?
Put more energy into it.

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:15.330
Han-se!

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.600
This is ridiculous, but funny.

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:19.668
Uh-woot!

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:22.804
Uh-woot!

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.708
Hey, if it's outdoors where we're going,

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:29.511
then doing something in the rain
would be really nice.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.446
-Right.
-That's what's romantic.

01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:34.082
[Jung Kook] There are cool guys here too.

01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:35.183
[Jimin] You're right.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.052
[Jung Kook] A romantic bicycle.

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:38.820
That's what's romantic.

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:42.190
That's romance.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.493
-I want to get rained on out there.
-What?

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:46.495
I'll drive and go ahead.

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.130
Please pull up over there.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.297
No, no.

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:52.934
It's pretty. So pretty!

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:02.244
FORCED ROMANTIC EXPERIENCE

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.790
MAN JUST SOAKED IN RAIN

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:17.793
STILL LOVING IT

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:20.428
FEELING BRIENZ'S VIBE WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:23.298
-So nice!
-That's what I'm talking about!

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.634
TWO GUYS MAKING ANOTHER MEMORY IN THE RAIN

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.835
ALREADY NEAR DESTINATION

01:28:26.902 --> 01:28:27.936
[Jimin] We're here.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.305
[Jung Kook] Is this it?

01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:34.242
[car alarm beeping]

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.346
Let's get out.

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:40.315
-Get out right away?
-Yeah.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:42.818
-Should we stop this? After one clap?
-We can.

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.853
12 YEAR IDOLS DECIDING
THE ENDING THEMSELVES

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.756
The rear one will capture it too, right?
One, two, three.

01:28:52.127 --> 01:28:53.728
Waste of storage.

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:55.230
The rear one is a bit far.

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:57.365
Don't look down on me.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.768
I'll hold you.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.903
What good is holding my butt?

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.874
Hey, how do we film us getting out, then?

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:07.375
Should we turn it back on?

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:11.346
Now, this is a separate recording.
We couldn't film us getting out.

01:29:11.413 --> 01:29:14.115
Getting out together like this.
You know, right?

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.754
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:25.060
Before we could film ourselves
getting out,

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:27.796
we clapped and stopped the cameras.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:31.266
But we turned on the center camera
and made a separate recording.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.434
Take it out.

01:29:32.968 --> 01:29:34.302
Take it.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:35.871
Take it and get lost.

01:29:37.806 --> 01:29:38.874
I knew it.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.276
On a day like this,
you should walk in the rain.

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:44.713
There's something scary
about trips, everyone.

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:47.015
You shouldn't travel too often.

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:50.418
You forget how precious they are.

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:52.387
You start craving beer.

01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:54.122
BIG PROBLEM: BEER COMING TO MIND

01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:55.490
When I was driving here...

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.859
the trees, the lake...

01:29:59.995 --> 01:30:01.863
...and the rain, the three together...

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:04.799
Wow, I was amazed the whole way
while driving.

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:07.369
I almost flew off while driving.

01:30:08.303 --> 01:30:09.371
To the lake.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.907
This place is quite local, they say.

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.541
-[Jimin] Are you ready?
-Yes.

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:14.843
[Jimin] I'll open the door.

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:18.413
Hey, this is so nice.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:21.650
Saying it's nice as soon as I walk in.

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.752
Can we go in with our shoes on?

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.820
I think they wear shoes inside here.

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:28.056
But this place has low ceilings.

01:30:28.123 --> 01:30:30.692
That's actually better.
It has a good vibe.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.428
I'd like it
if a lizard or something came out.
