00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:51,930
They'll ask you one day to tell them the story of how the world was saved. They'll

2
00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:09,480
want to know how we found our heroes, and together, fought back. But to tell that story, you

3
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:19,460
young to remember how green the world was, how light, how full of hope. And how we were too

4
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,400
blinded by the light of our own happiness to see the darkness buried right under our own feet.

5
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,080
And when it finally came, it had only one purpose to destroy all that was good.

6
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:46,160
It was men who fought first, because that's what men do. We fought. We bled. We lost.

7
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:10,660
So our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, they picked up the sword. They put on the

8
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,690
sword. And we beat you.

9
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,500
This world has been broken many times. And the breakers are always different.

10
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,260
Sometimes they come from space, sometimes from underground, sometimes they're human. Sometimes

11
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:13,880
animal. Other times, no form at all, a germ, a disease, and energy. But they bring death,

12
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:26,760
always death. A death is always followed by rebirth, destruction by renewal. And that first

13
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,420
job in 15 years ago, this age old cycle started again. You see, the stitch was always there.

14
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,040
Mother Earth had just buried it deep, deep down, to protect us, to protect our most cherished creations.

15
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,000
And then we cut down the forest, melted the ice, opened up the stitch, and all the breakers out.

16
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,200
A young lady, just who was telling the story here? Okay, we've told the story a million times,

17
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,020
start. I want to code the x-dory. Well, you had one this morning. So, as I was saying,

18
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,160
the destruction of the boreal forest. Codeiac. How we can do maths? Codeiac. How about algebra?

19
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,880
How could some algebra? How about physics? Codeiac! Okay, silence, silence.

20
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:36,520
Shh. Willow wins again. This is the story of how Codeiac took out 100 breakers with one swipe

21
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:44,900
of his mighty axe. It was just the year after the stitch had opened, and our brave forces were

22
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,400
gathered in Glasgow for their first assault. The nights were long and wet and windy. The only thing

23
00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:00,520
that kept them going were these stories. My dad is a born storyteller. He says our stories are

24
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:09,920
as important as our guns, our swords, especially now. Stories give those of us that are still left,

25
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:18,340
hope. They inspire our warriors like my mum to keep fighting.

26
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,530
He tells me these things not to scare me, but to remind me that one day they'll need me to tell

27
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:41,210
the story. The story of how we pulled ourselves away from all this darkness and death and destruction.

28
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,330
And found the lights. They were ready to fight. Were there flowers in the island?

29
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:59,270
Yeah, there are flowers. Thousands of reds and purples, yellows, colors like you and believe.

30
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:15,470
The island is so bright. It was so beautiful. Like heaven, heaven. Don't worry,

31
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,830
sounds closer than it really is. Whether animals on the island? Back then, so many.

32
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:36,050
It'd be, maybe they're still there. Bunnies, bunnies, birds and badgers.

33
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,360
All right, pretty girl. I'm gonna go grab some presents.

34
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,440
You mum? Yeah, baby. We have to go wake up.

35
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,620
Make a wish.

36
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
Thank you.

37
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,920
Mom, it's beautiful. That is warm. I'm a little bit cold there, I shouldn't eat it.

38
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:11,720
There? Where are we going? Okay, my turn. All right, now I know you're not my way

39
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,080
But I am 15. Yeah, it's been seen that you've never had a real one. I thought maybe.

40
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,360
No, you're so cute. I love him. What is it? That's a dog.

41
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,660
You might have been Travis from the nine block makes them. Proceeds go to veterans.

42
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,290
Maybe someday we'll find you a real one. What is name? Well, he's yours now, you name him.

43
00:11:50,540 --> 00:12:04,960
It's time now. We'll make five minutes. Yes sir. Well, fill it up. It sounds awesome. Just close,

44
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:13,060
boots, thumbs, okay? Yeah, him too. How long will he be gone? Just fill it up, will I?

45
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:28,590
But does. Is that true, Sally? Is that true, Sally? Is that true, Sally?

46
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:34,010
Yeah, wow, baby. No, it's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:46,390
Close that stitch, I don't understand. When close is another one, I don't think so. We can't hold the line anymore.

48
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,210
We lost the earth, but tell you, and do hours to come here, come here, come here.

49
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,810
Close. You know, we've got 15 veterans in this block alone. We can still fight.

50
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:05,790
You too, you did fight. I can fight again. Listen to me. You get one bite, even a single scrum.

51
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,150
You don't look who's talking. It's been 72 hours, so I'm clear. Yeah, I totally am here, and you know.

52
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,570
I want to help that as you may be. It was an icing on the back.

53
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:30,070
You. You know, I just did. Well, that's it, that.

54
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,570
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

55
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:01,330
Hey, hey, quickslaw. Are there any hybrids? Who's this hybrids? If you don't get your last last, you're going to become one. Go on! Go on!

56
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,790
Go on! This one's calling to Mercy Bay, right? Yes, ma'am. Get in.

57
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,350
I need to write in the front. Leave the convoy. What's you going to get there, okay?

58
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,370
Well, what? My mum, where are we going? Dad, where are we?

59
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,630
Somebody save. Come on.

60
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,390
Listen up. And it can hurt your wife. He's too much a sneeze. He's too much a cough.

61
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,970
I've seen it happen if it happens to me. I won't pull the trigger myself.

62
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,720
You know, I do his concern and not us.

63
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,800
You don't have time for that shit?

64
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,240
You know, you're not totally immune. You might have a bad job, so you think you are?

65
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,820
She's right. No one is. We can turn. Sure. Anybody can.

66
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,920
The male brain is simple. Synapse is in straight lines. One language.

67
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,680
The infection burns them out quick. Our synapses are like waves that stretch clear across our

68
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,060
brains. And cross each other multiple times. We're more complicated.

69
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,800
My bread more complicated. Lady, you are a female teenager. You're a damn near and

70
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,440
destructible.

71
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,300
Ready to fight. Just like Koleak.

72
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,040
What about Koleak? He's not a woman. He's killed over 100 breakers. I'm sure he's got scratched. Koleak can

73
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,340
return. He's part breaker himself. 100 breakers. I heard it was 300. What is it matter

74
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,460
the number? Point is he did it? His pet bear killed at least 50. Pet bear. Koleak is a bear.

75
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,940
Look at the bloody hair old. You're wrong. The bear is how he got the name. He raised it from

76
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,300
the cup. He found an anchorage. I died of foot with him. Oh, not it.

77
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,560
By the pattern for every man who said they fought with Koleak. No, it's not a matter.

78
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,600
Isn't a Scottish blitz? I heard nobody got out of that one and escaped. No one did.

79
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,700
Koleak has a bear. You never told me that. Doesn't matter. The story is the zone.

80
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,520
There are no bears to fight like one. Like we need to fight to the claw.

81
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,580
The second little Koleak bear is a fight to Koleak.

82
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,160
I come to the family bear. We'll be there soon, my love. Try and get some sleep.

83
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,340
Stay in the trap!

84
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,670
Go, go!

85
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,940
Come on, you got you. You okay now?

86
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,940
That was the last of them. Come on. What happened? They were honest.

87
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:24,960
Before we could react, three of them. Get everyone off the road into the forest. It's safer.

88
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,660
Let's go to get out of the road into the forest. Quickly!

89
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,340
Yeah, everyone off the road!

90
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,020
What? Oh, I got five ten minutes. Everyone's different. I'll stay with you till it's over.

91
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,610
Oh, thank you. Your face!

92
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,360
It's okay. It's human, not break. It's not too far. It must be bears.

93
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,260
It's worth to talk a moment. There's maybe five. We'll get there by dawn.

94
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,740
Can you earn? Why? When I raise?

95
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,960
Take my guy. No, he's no point. That'll slow him down at best.

96
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,280
Listen to me. Can you make it through this?

97
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,500
You can't stop. You can be afraid. But you can't let it stop you.

98
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,960
Like what scares you move you forward. You understand?

99
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,620
I love you, Willon.

100
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,760
I have to stand.

101
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Oh, I have to stand. I have to fight.

102
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,400
You said we were going, you said we had to come. They need me.

103
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,640
You said we? You said we?

104
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,420
I need me. I need you.

105
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,160
I need you.

106
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:19,320
Hold them back. You go!

107
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,640
What's with me?

108
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm not that way. He's way. What? What? What? What's out of me to go with them? Move!

109
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,620
They would you call it?

110
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,380
Keep moving. They're almost there.

111
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:29,560
Have the stories I told you. Back in the day before you were born,

112
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,680
my mom and I would go fishing.

113
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,660
You mean when they were fish? That's what you made those up.

114
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Get that.

115
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,000
That's small, but it's sea worthy.

116
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,360
It's not that small. We could still take a couple of those people with us.

117
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,800
This is our path, not theirs.

118
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,560
But we could help.

119
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,420
Well, this is our path. You and me. We cannot think about anyone else right now, okay?

120
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
Come on.

121
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,960
Isn't that how the world breaks?

122
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,300
Please, under the wall.

123
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,520
Hey!

124
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,200
Yours? No. No, we're just checking it, looking for food.

125
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,600
It's your book.

126
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,800
Okay, okay. It's our boat and you're going to get me out of here.

127
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,410
Those things are coming. Come on. Get it in the water.

128
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,930
Okay, we're still going to go very far without petrol.

129
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,790
You don't think I'd leave it here with a tank full of gas steel?

130
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,430
There's someone to steal? No. Motors dry.

131
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,650
So where's the fucking gas?

132
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,210
It's in the boot of one of the cars around the corner.

133
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,820
Okay, come on. Come on.

134
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Stay here. Stay here. Okay, let's go.

135
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,920
Is it just you? Please, no.

136
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,520
Everyone know what it means. What?

137
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,300
What it means is just to let's get his.

138
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,220
Not our wives, not our mothers, not our daughters.

139
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,380
When they have turned, it's now biology and attacks the white chromosome.

140
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,960
It's either. That's what it means.

141
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,040
The world went to revenge. I think you wrote a blame.

142
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,080
Something you just can't wash off.

143
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,780
Open it. Open it. Just get in my key.

144
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,280
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

145
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,100
What about the man?

146
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,140
He got scared. He ran off. Come on. Help me.

147
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,120
What my come? One, two, three.

148
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,520
What do you say, babe? Do you want to get some breakfast?

149
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,420
Hold on tight, babe.

150
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,420
I promise that.

151
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,560
Sorry, Mrs. Time. How long he take three?

152
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,140
You'll see. It's not so bad having just one.

153
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,420
Nothing in the snares?

154
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,280
I'll come on. You're always happy when those traps are empty.

155
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,140
Need to eat, Willa.

156
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,400
Not just tin beans and scraps from the garden and you need protein.

157
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,420
I'm so deusky, honey.

158
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,160
Black.

159
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,240
I told you that climb is too risky.

160
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,400
It was easy to answer. Don't get cocky young lady. Anything happens to you.

161
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
All right, take them aside.

162
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,800
I'll leave them when I'm done.

163
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,060
What's the wood on the fire? The dry stuff of wet stuff is too smoky.

164
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,820
Why do you let me spit the wood sometimes?

165
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,840
Huh?

166
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,960
I mean, I can swing an axe like Code Jack taking off a break his head and like you.

167
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,300
Oh yeah, you think so?

168
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,120
What are you trying me?

169
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,160
All right, show me.

170
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,180
Come on.

171
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,280
Show me how you swing that sword. You will not let you split the rest.

172
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,080
Come on.

173
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,110
You're not ready, Willa. You need more training.

174
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:06,580
Oh good. Kindly.

175
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,380
Did you see what happened when you first approached me head on like that?

176
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,720
I painted you past and I came in from behind and gave myself the advantage.

177
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,300
Understand?

178
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,820
Come on. I'll call you another.

179
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,700
Maybe some of this fire wouldn't, okay?

180
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,640
That show tonight only. Turn egg omelette.

181
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,020
French green beans. Get it while you can.

182
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,620
What are you doing?

183
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,820
I like the way that she did it.

184
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,280
Can you help me?

185
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,180
Okay, okay.

186
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,120
Did she teach you?

187
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,460
No. I had to learn. I'm watching how I do it.

188
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,060
Just like you're not in watching me.

189
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,790
The hunt to run, to climb, to fight, to survive.

190
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,170
And when this war is over, you'll get to learn the rest.

191
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,410
What's the rest?

192
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,070
To live.

193
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,590
How shall she know where I look like now?

194
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,690
Oh, well. It's only been a year.

195
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,490
Only. She could pass me on the street and she won't recognize me.

196
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,070
I think you're over estimating.

197
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,750
Do you think she's met Kodiak?

198
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,330
Sure. Of course. Why not?

199
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,650
She was Kodiak, she's safe.

200
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,150
Okay.

201
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,810
How is it?

202
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,630
Looks just like how she did it.

203
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,850
Can we eat?

204
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,580
Okay, just one. And then you eat.

205
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,780
Okay, just one story and then we eat.

206
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,400
This is the story of when Kodiak was way up north.

207
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,420
He was collecting firewood for the long, cold winter ahead.

208
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,980
Now remember, for Kodiak, gathering firewood is not like what we do picking up sticks and

209
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,020
drift with no one. He could take down an entire tree with his axe and entire forest.

210
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,590
Now with every blow of that mighty axe,

211
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,890
I know it would run most with a sky.

212
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,530
You only made that axe himself.

213
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,580
We carved the handle from an English oak that had been hit by lightning.

214
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,390
Forged it from steel, from an old Welsh mining ground.

215
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,580
Time and hard, indestructible.

216
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,450
A day, he was heading back to his camp.

217
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,600
He heard something, something no one had ever heard before.

218
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,330
He was the first to see it, the stitch,

219
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,760
and crawl and out of it.

220
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,400
Break yes.

221
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,160
But he wasn't scared.

222
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,700
No, obviously wasn't scared.

223
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,800
He was ready to fight.

224
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,720
Yes, he finally did.

225
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,480
I need to gather 100 breakers with one swipe of his mighty axe.

226
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,920
Well, it was one breaker, actually.

227
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,540
But it was the first.

228
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,680
Many more came after we know that.

229
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,020
But this was the first and this is how we learned that to kill them.

230
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,460
You have to take off his hands.

231
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,140
Dika, are you ready to do it?

232
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,420
Not the only way.

233
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,520
The fastest bullets work, but they're not as effective.

234
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,760
Slows them down, but it doesn't kill them at the end.

235
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,780
Time for dinner.

236
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,200
These stories.

237
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,640
Yeah?

238
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,140
About cardiac.

239
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,500
You know them so well.

240
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,620
Where every parent does.

241
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,080
Are you sure?

242
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,040
What?

243
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,400
He's not you.

244
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,360
We're not.

245
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,980
Well, it sounds like you. Strong, powerful.

246
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,820
This is an axe.

247
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,820
Oh, please, go on.

248
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,320
Go on.

249
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,180
Where an eye ford.

250
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,720
We would go into battle knowing there was a giant out there

251
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
where an axe made of lightning,

252
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,900
slicing through breakers like a hot knife through butter.

253
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,820
Cardiac gives us hope.

254
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,840
If he could stand tall, if he could save this world from breaking.

255
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,020
Maybe you could.

256
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,240
Because he's totally you.

257
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,960
Well,

258
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,380
these stories are important.

259
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,940
We need to keep telling them how the stitch opened,

260
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,460
how the first breakers came then the hybrids and how we stood tall.

261
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,580
How we fought back, found our heroes.

262
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,720
And one day,

263
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,420
when this world is bright and green and alive again,

264
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,560
we will go back.

265
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,240
Believe her?

266
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,600
Oh, yes, I do.

267
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
Because when I look at you,

268
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,440
and then mine did.

269
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,240
Well,

270
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,720
hope.

271
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,020
Now, I'll have your dinner.

272
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,670
Pause here.

273
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:04,950
Oh,

274
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,810
Stix is warmer.

275
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,790
No, she doesn't have furlates.

276
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,040
This is fighting, but where is he?

277
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,000
Not so peaceful.

278
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,460
They can't see us coming.

279
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,860
No, they don't see like we do.

280
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,780
I don't think they have eyes.

281
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,140
I think I've other senses once we don't have.

282
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,500
The hybrids are the breakers used them as their eyes and ears,

283
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,600
kind of like they're connected somehow.

284
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,860
You know, brains are braiding.

285
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,300
But they don't know where, here, right, on this island.

286
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,240
If they did my love, they wouldn't be on this island.

287
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,500
What about the landlines?

288
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,180
Just a precaution.

289
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,760
Just don't be breakers.

290
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,640
Just stop anyone.

291
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,120
You know, it's up. You're going to need your energy.

292
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,580
Why did they want to hear us? If we didn't do anything to them?

293
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,380
Remember our lessons about insects and

294
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,680
I'm going to kill the wasp. We're trying to invade there until.

295
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,460
Yeah.

296
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,280
Oh, maybe it's like that.

297
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,080
They think we're like the wasp.

298
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,700
Trying to invade their home.

299
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,780
So they eliminate the threat.

300
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,660
Us.

301
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,920
It's our home, too.

302
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,830
Not it is. That it is.

303
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,650
We're going to be ready to fight for it.

304
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,360
Are you ready to fight?

305
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,250
I got...

306
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
33 seconds.

307
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,940
Can't you hear them? The breakers are coming.

308
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
What are you doing here, my horn?

309
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,220
Get to the cottage.

310
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,720
28 seconds.

311
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,360
Which direction is the cottage from the white cliffs?

312
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,740
No.

313
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,900
How far?

314
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,120
We're both miles.

315
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,100
Faster than I could come on.

316
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,740
Don't shoot breakers.

317
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,460
The hybrids are coming.

318
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,560
They're coming for you little dog.

319
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Save me, will I? Save me.

320
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,860
59.

321
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,140
Thanks to directions to the bunkers.

322
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,480
No, no.

323
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
They're behind you.

324
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,680
Come on.

325
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,880
Come on. Almost there.

326
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,260
In a tent.

327
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,540
How do you kill a breaker?

328
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,860
How do you kill a breaker?

329
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,380
Oh, decab. Show me.

330
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,560
And a hybrin?

331
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,720
Decab.

332
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
No, not enough.

333
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,340
Brains.

334
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,920
No, not 22.

335
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,200
It's not bad.

336
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,960
But you could do better.

337
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,760
You'll act my good.

338
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,880
What are you about?

339
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:34,960
Okay.

340
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,200
Oh, no.

341
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,460
On your mark.

342
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,460
Get set.

343
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,100
Come on, nugget!

344
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,590
You're a ward.

345
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,710
Dying?

346
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,910
For not quitting.

347
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,510
Oh, bug is it?

348
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,890
Oh, I wish it were.

349
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,490
More protein.

350
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,150
What are they?

351
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,250
Strawberries.

352
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:47,830
Trivan.

353
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,050
I think I've always grown wild here.

354
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,750
It's just assumed they died out with everything else.

355
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,170
It's silent, it's special.

356
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,030
Somehow, they're still holding on.

357
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,110
Spit them.

358
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,850
No.

359
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,370
You have them all.

360
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,770
I've tried them before.

361
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,790
No, not there.

362
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,790
Just the red bit.

363
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,290
Yeah.

364
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:22,530
Uh.

365
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,130
I still have precious.

366
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,070
It's to be a lot more of them back in the old days.

367
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:29,650
Strawberries?

368
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,710
Places.

369
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,310
Your mum.

370
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,190
When we got married, just before you were born before the stitch.

371
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:44,290
All she wanted for the wedding party was strawberry, shortcake.

372
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,070
What is stupid, okay?

373
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,110
It's a yellow cake, sweet whipped cream, and dozens of the house.

374
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:52,930
dozens?

375
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,090
Did she like them?

376
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,050
Like them?

377
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,410
She ate the whole damn cake.

378
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,930
Didn't even come for anyone else.

379
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,890
She was the...

380
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,840
She is the life of the party.

381
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,960
Always has been.

382
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,780
That she loves strawberries.

383
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,920
Like you do, apparently.

384
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,100
I can't believe it doesn't think I'm ready yet.

385
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,040
Yeah, just don't worry about her.

386
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,180
To fight.

387
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,920
To fight like mum fights.

388
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,360
You don't know.

389
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,740
He just thinks that I can't do or he did to that man.

390
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,060
But I could fight.

391
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:13,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

392
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,300
He's okay, he just...

393
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,540
Okay, no, you're fine.

394
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,120
You're okay, just don't move.

395
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,920
I take his step back, okay? I just...

396
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,360
He's like my legs.

397
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,380
Okay, you did you want?

398
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,560
Okay.

399
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,520
I'm too...

400
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,760
Okay, okay, don't move.

401
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,880
Let's get back from this.

402
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
Okay, um...

403
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,240
Okay, you're okay.

404
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,380
Do you want to tell me what happened?

405
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,240
Are you alone?

406
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,560
Is someone out there?

407
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,640
Is anybody over there?

408
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,700
No, it's fine, okay.

409
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,180
Uh... no, okay, you know what, I'm gonna...

410
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,120
I'm gonna take you someplace more.

411
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,960
Let's... let's go to this one.

412
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,580
Okay, just a little further.

413
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,030
Stay right here.

414
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

415
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,990
Let's get you warmed up.

416
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,300
Here you go.

417
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,640
Drink something.

418
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,000
He must be thirsty.

419
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,760
Are you bleeding?

420
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,520
Just hit my head on the boat.

421
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,700
What boat?

422
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,920
We were headed up the coast to my grandma's house.

423
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,520
He said it'd be safe for there.

424
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,320
Something came up from below.

425
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,500
Just over.

426
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,120
A dad, a brother.

427
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,100
We all went in the water.

428
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,200
We didn't know they could swim and I was big.

429
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,140
Okay, okay, now.

430
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,340
I'm willing.

431
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,960
I was your name.

432
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:42,660
Gross.

433
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:48,870
Did everyone ask me about it?

434
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,210
It's the last time you ate Rosie.

435
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:56,010
Okay.

436
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,890
This is what I have left.

437
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,810
I'm going to go and get you some real food, okay?

438
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:11,330
No.

439
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,370
It's okay, you need to eat.

440
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:14,350
You need protein.

441
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,890
You have to do as make sure the fight keeps going.

442
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:17,830
I can't.

443
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,990
We have to do as put a log on and make sure it doesn't die.

444
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,260
Please don't leave.

445
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,170
Okay.

446
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:29,750
I'll stay.

447
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,180
You're free this longer.

448
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,620
Where are you going?

449
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,100
You're game.

450
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,180
You're game.

451
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,650
You don't have much time. Let's go.

452
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,730
They're waiting at the bus.

453
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,810
Mom, we need to go now. There's no time.

454
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,150
But what about Dad? We can't just leave.

455
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,410
Dad, we need to get him.

456
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,750
We need soldiers. We're warriors like you.

457
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,590
You can't fight anymore. You can.

458
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,690
Mom, what's wrong? Aren't you ready?

459
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,690
I... I told you.

460
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:55,790
I'm sorry.

461
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,790
We're not... don't leave me, you know?

462
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,860
No matter how bad you ask, we may be.

463
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,110
You've been gone all day.

464
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,050
I got scoured the island. I blew the horn. Didn't you hear it?

465
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,030
It was... I fast deep in the pangrove.

466
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,310
Because of all the trailing. I'm sorry.

467
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,170
Oh, my God.

468
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,930
Sit down. Make you some food.

469
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,900
You might have noticed it's not easy surviving out here.

470
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,980
The tin fruit has gone. The garden has spent.

471
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,620
We are living on fumes, well.

472
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,660
We have to be careful. We have to be smart.

473
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,540
That gun. It was that man's, wasn't it?

474
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,550
We left a wrong behind that night we came here.

475
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,570
Did never choice, not that night.

476
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:57,710
Mom did.

477
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,530
What?

478
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,110
Had a choice?

479
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,450
Could you choose to leave us?

480
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,850
I'm had to leave. To save the world and I had to save you.

481
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,390
Are you all bad?

482
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:15,950
What?

483
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:24,250
And then, are you all bad? Because you can turn and we got?

484
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,990
No, I'm not.

485
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,450
Of course not.

486
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,550
Not all men are bad.

487
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,370
And girls can turn, too, remember.

488
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,490
It's just less likely.

489
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,930
Baby, kill breakers.

490
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,170
Of course. I told you the stories.

491
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:49,030
When it comes to it, if it comes to it, you will too.

492
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:50,770
Hi, Brits.

493
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,690
Yes, but it's not so easy. They will want us.

494
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,810
Would you kill a person?

495
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,700
If they threatened you or mom, in any way?

496
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:14,300
Yes, I would.

497
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,560
Right.

498
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,880
You need to eat some soup.

499
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,200
Okay, slow down. I don't have many of those. It's better to save me.

500
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,060
Do you live here?

501
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,580
Oh, no. I just let me have some time to get away.

502
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,560
It's like a girl cave.

503
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,880
Are you alone? Like me?

504
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,160
Yeah.

505
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,430
Where do you live? Really?

506
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:42,230
Come.

507
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,270
You want to see something?

508
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:45,850
Sure.

509
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,810
This is what the world used to look like for the stitch opened.

510
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,810
Okay, one looks so happy.

511
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,870
Yeah.

512
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:15,930
It is.

513
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,170
I dad said he's a good fish.

514
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,550
Fish?

515
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,200
What are these?

516
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,140
I don't know.

517
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,760
He's sort of like breakers.

518
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,420
The ones that they were flowers back then.

519
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,780
Thousands of colors you've never seen.

520
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,840
Everything is alive.

521
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,700
The world is bright and beautiful.

522
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,900
I miss my dad and my brother.

523
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,320
It's okay. It's okay.

524
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,340
Hopefully out there right now, looking for you.

525
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,800
What's his name?

526
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,480
Bear.

527
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,600
He's a dog.

528
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,520
He's a dog, but I call him Bear because he fights a codiac.

529
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,960
A codiac is dead.

530
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,280
What?

531
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,960
Well, if he were alive, he could do all the things they say.

532
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,820
We don't want by now.

533
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,510
He can't do it on his own.

534
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:49,810
He needs a help too.

535
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,320
Do you like stories?

536
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,290
This is the story about codiac and the first battle breakers.

537
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:19,570
It was after the first stage opened and already codiac was a leader among men.

538
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:29,970
codiac and the men slayed every single breaker that came at them.

539
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,720
We thought we were on the battle.

540
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,520
This is when they realized that breakers weren't only enemy.

541
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,900
We were also fighting with ourselves.

542
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,130
So, codiac killed the first hybrid.

543
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,350
Yep. And he told us how to do it.

544
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,230
I've got to mush the brains.

545
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,030
I think I'll stop them.

546
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,250
That's right.

547
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:29,230
It's a good year, it's not dead.

548
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,750
He's out there fighting for us and with us.

549
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,190
And together we're going to close that stitch.

550
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,410
And the world won't be broken anymore.

551
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,450
You'll see.

552
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,570
And then I go, I'll be back soon with some more food.

553
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,890
Will you be okay?

554
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,550
This is for you.

555
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:53,890
I'll keep you warm.

556
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,050
When can I leave?

557
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,430
Soon.

558
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,420
Come on!

559
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,780
30-3 seconds, faster!

560
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,600
That's one yet!

561
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,540
Come on, now get hit it!

562
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,340
Stay on that log.

563
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,320
Focus! Keep going!

564
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,000
Come on!

565
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,400
That's my girl!

566
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,340
Keep a bit of this! Come on, Willah!

567
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,040
It's under a minute!

568
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,500
Keep going!

569
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,760
It's your best time yet.

570
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,840
What are you thinking about?

571
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,160
The break is a hybrid.

572
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,340
Just kill them!

573
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,540
Good.

574
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,500
You just take up four breakers.

575
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,000
Now...

576
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,900
Now...

577
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,600
There's a hybrid coming.

578
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,740
I take you. They take you. They take you.

579
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,280
It's not mud.

580
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,880
Come on!

581
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,400
Come on, then.

582
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,960
Daddy, you okay?

583
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
I'm not your daddy!

584
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,100
Do you need help?

585
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,800
Hi, Brit!

586
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,500
Hi, Brit! Don't!

587
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,640
I didn't want to save you, little pig!

588
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,980
Come out! Come out! Wherever you!

589
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,010
Dad!

590
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,490
Are you okay?

591
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,990
Give me my stack or you.

592
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:55,630
Okay.

593
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,440
You might have some soup, okay?

594
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,580
No.

595
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,040
Dad.

596
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,880
I'm fine.

597
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,500
You're not eating.

598
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,860
Of course I'm eating.

599
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:30,680
No.

600
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,680
You're not eating, so I can eat.

601
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,800
Well, we have to keep rationing until she comes.

602
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,220
You know what if she doesn't?

603
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,800
Don't say that.

604
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,860
What if they lose the war?

605
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,100
Then you would have kept me here for what?

606
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:49,900
For nothing.

607
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:50,760
Not nothing.

608
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,120
I'm just supposed to stay here,

609
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,400
carrying around rocks, swinging about a wooden sword,

610
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,040
training me for a war you won't even let me fight.

611
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,760
I am not just training you to fight, will I?

612
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm training you to live.

613
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,120
How is this living?

614
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,660
This is like a prison.

615
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,480
We stay here and do nothing.

616
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:11,720
What's other mothers?

617
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:17,730
Five years.

618
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,650
Five years, I fought.

619
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,970
And your mother is still out there fighting.

620
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,790
We lost everything, will I?

621
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:31,570
Everything.

622
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,200
Don't ever say we did nothing.

623
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:54,960
I'm sorry.

624
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,300
She loved you very much.

625
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,700
Then why isn't she here?

626
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:35,770
I promised your mom.

627
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,890
I wouldn't give this to you until you were ready.

628
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:44,770
Yesterday, you proved that.

629
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,330
This was mine.

630
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,110
And now it's yours.

631
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,990
I will show you how to fight like she does.

632
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,600
I'm going to go check the rabbit slers.

633
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,280
Great.

634
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,700
Rabbit's due for lunch, then.

635
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,840
I'm back.

636
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,410
Happy like Sardine.

637
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,220
Oh, I want to see.

638
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:37,640
No.

639
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,020
Rosie?

640
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,740
Rosie, why would you do this to bear?

641
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,500
Rosie?

642
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:07,830
But you're okay.

643
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:13,580
Let go. Come on.

644
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,130
You look at you.

645
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:22,590
Did it hurt?

646
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,290
Are you scratched?

647
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,110
What did it hurt?

648
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,350
What did I do?

649
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,770
What did I do?

650
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,870
Listen to me.

651
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:32,870
Listen to me.

652
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:34,250
None of that matters now.

653
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,530
It called out to them.

654
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,630
It's signal to them.

655
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,610
You remember what I told you?

656
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,210
The breakers and the hybrids, they are connected.

657
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,670
They know we are here now, so we leave.

658
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:44,730
What were we going?

659
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,350
But go.

660
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:50,880
Hey.

661
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,360
This is what you're trying for, Willa.

662
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:56,060
The breakers are coming and they will destroy everything here

663
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,140
and it looks like they are.

664
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,200
We're going back.

665
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,800
We're going home.

666
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,300
No.

667
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:02,400
We've got someone.

668
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,220
And it's just not here.

669
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,640
Dad, I'm scared.

670
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,300
You and that, what scares you?

671
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,120
Of you, for what?

672
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:14,840
Remember?

673
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,190
We're on the wrong side of the island.

674
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,990
Along the hike up and over to the other side.

675
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:26,910
You never told me they could swim.

676
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,130
The predator's well.

677
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,390
When they say it's praying, nothing's going to stop.

678
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,450
And we're going to go.

679
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,190
I'd like to come ashore on the beach because it's less rocky.

680
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,190
The mind should sort them down a bit.

681
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,650
You have a time to get to the coast.

682
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:46,190
We're still moving.

683
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,390
You have those explosions and means we don't have a lot of time.

684
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,990
10, 15 minutes of most.

685
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,590
But we get to the boat.

686
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:52,950
What are we going to go?

687
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,430
South.

688
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,330
Keep the main land to the left.

689
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:56,870
And we keep going.

690
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,610
South is our safest land.

691
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:07,900
No.

692
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,240
My leg.

693
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,020
Let's just rest here.

694
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,580
Just for a bit.

695
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,540
Why are you doing fine?

696
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,300
Once we're through the prime forest,

697
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,180
another five minutes down into the coast.

698
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,380
Where's your head?

699
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,440
I gave it to her.

700
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,140
Now I was just trying to help.

701
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,050
God.

702
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,610
God is on my phone.

703
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:41,850
Now.

704
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:43,770
This world.

705
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:44,930
What's happened?

706
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:45,990
None of it is your fault.

707
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:46,450
You understand?

708
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,110
Yeah.

709
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,190
And what happened to that girl?

710
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,270
It wasn't her fault either.

711
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,630
It just happened.

712
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:54,930
Yeah.

713
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:57,390
Eat this.

714
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,230
I'll keep you warm.

715
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,330
Five minutes and we go.

716
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,140
Do you want a story?

717
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,200
No.

718
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,620
No.

719
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,420
Who are you?

720
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,900
What if you don't with my daughter?

721
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,580
Not like the others.

722
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,520
Not a courteous story.

723
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,620
I went from the floor.

724
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,500
The floor?

725
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,480
The story without?

726
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,480
That was how to tell.

727
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,560
So why you need to tell them?

728
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,260
Already they were wrong.

729
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,400
They were going to be wrong.

730
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,440
These are the awful things happening up north.

731
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,420
Entire towns ravaged.

732
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,360
People slaughtered by an enemy we did not yet understand.

733
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,900
But we didn't care about any of it.

734
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,020
We were happy.

735
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,760
I never met anyone with so much light.

736
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,820
So much love.

737
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:36,080
We knew that no matter what should come, we had each other, and we couldn't wait to bring

738
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:48,570
you into this world. And when you finally came, this little lamb, suffering of trust and

739
01:14:48,570 --> 01:15:04,260
under, he didn't pray, he didn't scream, he hadn't no fear, just for that small amount of moments.

740
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:31,500
Don't break up. You told me it was going to be hard. What a nice of you told me hard.

741
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,540
I know that you're out there. I know that you're coming back.

742
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,920
Please, if you can make it to the run.

743
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,880
Back to me.

744
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,560
Help me.

745
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,840
Save her.

746
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:11,140
There. We go back.

747
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,080
It's no fun. It's keep this way.

748
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,180
We'll be there soon.

749
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,800
Here we go. Go, go. Through there.

750
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,920
You did this?

751
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,240
What?

752
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,800
You didn't go to the only one who can chop down a tree with a single blow.

753
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,660
The breakers aren't big enough to get across this. They'll have to go around, which should buy us a few minutes.

754
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,520
Unless we can't get over it.

755
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,580
Come on, maggot. You first work the plank.

756
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,660
You've done this a million times. Come on.

757
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:44,800
Eyes on the tree.

758
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,580
Are you ready? Focus on the front?

759
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:49,600
Focus?

760
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:52,920
Okay.

761
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,040
Please, okay?

762
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:00,740
No, stay there.

763
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,690
That's the brains. Remember?

764
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:42,410
That was a brother.

765
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:45,530
Any bites? Scratches? Any blood?

766
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,110
Good. Go. Go.

767
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,720
Can you make it? Can you get over it?

768
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,800
Hey. Who trained him?

769
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,000
Come on, get up.

770
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:12,980
Get up.

771
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,200
Get up.

772
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,920
Get up.

773
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,060
Get up.

774
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:42,440
I'm going to get up now.

775
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,560
Get up.

776
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,820
I can't.

777
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,900
You could do this.

778
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,840
This is what you're trained for.

779
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,060
You could do this.

780
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:32,970
I can't help you.

781
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,580
I can't help you.

782
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,020
She's still there.

783
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,580
I cannot help you, darling.

784
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,000
You remember how to prime and start the motor like I showed you?

785
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,640
I guess?

786
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,100
You guess? You do what you don't.

787
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,660
Yes, I do.

788
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,080
You cut the moring rope.

789
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,020
It's just one swipe, it's just slide down on it.

790
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,340
It's only one even need to push it.

791
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:29,940
Dad, you come on.

792
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:37,930
No.

793
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:39,870
No.

794
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:41,550
You said to me.

795
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,750
I don't give you as much time as I can, so you can get to the boat and go.

796
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,150
I will hold them off.

797
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:49,890
No, I can't stand. I'm going to fight.

798
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:51,410
I know you could fight.

799
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:54,330
You've already proved that to me, not today.

800
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:55,830
Not now.

801
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,750
Let me do this for you.

802
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,510
You are a warrior will.

803
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:09,610
So you fight.

804
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,510
But don't forget to love.

805
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,070
You can love it all.

806
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,630
Leave it to darkness.

807
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,770
This world is so broken.

808
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,610
I can't do it.

809
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:20,710
The world is a broken world.

810
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,290
It has ruined it.

811
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:32,770
Go.

812
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,170
Please, go.

813
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,170
Go.

814
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:36,170
Will it go?

815
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,210
One swipe of the shot!

816
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,560
No.

817
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:50,780
No!

818
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:12,920
I'm sorry.

819
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,220
I'm sorry.

820
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:29,180
They asked you one day to tell them the story.

821
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,060
Of how the world was saved.

822
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,530
And you tell them.

823
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,900
It was a girl named Willer, who was strong, full of hope and fear.

824
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,460
Willer was scared of what was to come.

825
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,540
But she was ready.

826
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:53,140
Because like in all good stories,

827
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,480
Willer had a hero.

828
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:06,240
And when they want to know if Kodiak is just a story, you'll tell them.

829
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,300
Kodiak is real.

830
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,740
The hero who gave Willer hope.

831
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,680
The hero who gives all of us hope.

832
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,660
Come on, man.

833
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,770
This will be the story of how the world didn't break.
