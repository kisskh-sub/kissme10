00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.989
(4 older women looking to fall in love again)

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.748
(Drive over to pick up...)

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.619
(the younger men waiting for older women.)

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.729
(Hi.)

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.059
(Nice to meet you.)

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.629
(May I ask what your name is?)

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:23.129
(It's Park Ye Eun.)

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.999
(You're a real beauty.)

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.368
(Their first encounter...)

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.269
(was like a movie scene.)

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.439
(The older women and younger men's first night)

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.008
(I can drink...)

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:36.678
(one glass of a soju-beer cocktail.)

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.009
(Laughing)

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.218
(Amid the happy atmosphere, )

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.989
(their eyes meet.)

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:46.619
(Glancing)

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.129
(You have something in your hair. Can I get it off?)

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.729
(It was bothering me.)

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:58.869
(A strange tension lingered on their first night.)

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.369
(The older women received a text message.)

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.238
(Send a Love QR Code...)

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.439
(to the person you're interested in within 15 minutes.)

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.908
(The older women send...)

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.208
(their Love QR Codes to the younger men.)

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:15.749
(The younger men scan the codes to see the older women's feelings.)

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.188
(Mu Jin...)

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.558
(received QR Codes from two older women.)

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.599
(Mu Jin gains a benefit for being chosen the most.)

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.658
(Secret Room)

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.298
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're interested in.)

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.568
(Secret Room: A space where they can guess the other person's age)

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.598
Whether it will be a blessing or a curse.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.809
(Which older woman's age does he want to know the most?)

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.709
After the first episode,

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.749
Seul Hye got herself a nickname.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.618
- Already?
- Yes.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.849
(I did?)

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.649
Isn't it Mu Jin's Mom?

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.219
It's Hwang Yes Seul Hye.

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.119
That's right. She's head over heels for Mr. Yes.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.288
(Do you sleep well even after coffee?)

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.459
(Yes.)

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.828
As things developed at lightning speed,

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.898
many viewers must've gotten totally absorbed.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.899
For sure.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.138
The Secret Room opened.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.238
- It did.
- So...

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.538
don't you want to know whose drawer...

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:14.978
- Mu Jin opened?
- For real.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.008
Didn't the episode end right before that?

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.849
- Yes.
- That was mean.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.849
(Kim Mu Jin gains the Love Benefit for receiving 2 Love QR Codes.)

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.088
(Check out the information of the person...)

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.328
(you're curious about in the Secret Room.)

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.369
(Mu Jin checks out the Secret Room for the first time.)

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.368
(Open the drawer and guess the age of the person you're interested in.)

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.598
(What you find out is a secret.)

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.069
What could the hint be?

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:49.139
(Whose age does Mu Jin want to know?)

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.788
(Choosing without hesitation)

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.219
He didn't think for long.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.288
(Bon Hee)

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.388
(It's Bon Hee's drawer.)

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.159
- It's Bon Hee.
- I see.

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.259
I knew it.

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.429
It's a duffle coat.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.099
Is that photo from when she was a student?

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.839
Hold on. Duffle coat means...

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.739
we're not that far apart age-wise.

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:22.879
I just wanted to know about Bon Hee.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.219
I'm not that curious about the others.

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:36.689
(He looks at Bon Hee's photo closely.)

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.459
I have really good eyesight.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.359
But the photo was blurry.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.910
I stared at it because the numbers were hard to make out.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.169
Numbers? There must be some on it.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.809
The numbers on the photo were hard to read.

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.179
But it was 2004.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.009
The year?

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.048
The date was left so he could know when it was taken.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.519
(Bon Hee's photo was taken in 2004.)

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.119
(Looking closely)

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.729
(What's the age gap between Bon Hee and Mu Jin?)

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.229
It seems like we are more than five years apart.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.768
(Thinking)

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.669
(Smiling)

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:30.749
(Mu Jin leaves the Secret Room with a mysterious smile.)

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:32.908
He said they were at least five years apart.

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.379
I don't know what it is,

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.449
but her bangs.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.359
They give off...

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.529
a really old vibe.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.759
I don't know what it is, okay? I'm sorry, Bon Hee.

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.229
From what I can see, she's in high school.

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.828
She seems to be in tenth grade.

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.498
Me too. It looks like a photo from middle or high school.

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.568
- Really?
- Yes.

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.808
Since Mu Jin said they were at least...

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:00.579
five years apart,

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.579
if I were to make a wild guess,

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:05.478
Bon Hee would have been born in the late 1980s...

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.719
and Mu Jin in the early 1990s.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:10.549
I think Mu Jin is in his 20s.

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.888
Judging solely by his face,

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.989
I thought Mu Jin was in his 20s.

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.558
But saying they're at least five years apart...

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.959
after looking at the photo suggests...

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.599
- he's nearly in his 30s?
- No.

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.728
If that were the case,

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.599
Mu Jin might be seeing Bon Hee much younger than we think.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.339
I doubt Mu Jin analyzed the photo properly.

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.709
- I agree with you.
- He made a bad analysis.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.178
He doesn't get the photo.

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:37.509
- That's possible.
- Right?

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:45.188
It's the morning of the next day.

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:46.189
It's Day Two.

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.528
(The first to wake up is...)

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.899
(Sang Hyeon.)

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.569
(Spatula)

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.738
(Cleaning with an alcohol swab)

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:02.139
- What is he doing?
- What is that?

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.169
(Lightly)

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.038
(Using his finger as a palette, )

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.309
(he spreads it with effort.)

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.149
(Getting up)

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:17.148
My gosh.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.149
(Putting on makeup in earnest)

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.319
He's using a spatula?

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.018
Is he a makeup artist?

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:22.688
(A reasonable question)

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:23.829
(Amazed)

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:25.188
Do you use that too, Seul Hye?

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.959
No, not even my makeup artist does.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.869
(The Golden Retriever takes great care of himself.)

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.039
(Sang Hyeon is grooming himself before meeting the older women.)

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.708
(The other younger men do too.)

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:43.078
They sure are different.

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:44.079
Right?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.909
- Everyone does their own hair.
- For real.

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.978
That's a pretty rare sight...

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.719
- from my point of view.
- Why?

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.718
I have quite a few guy friends...

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.089
who wear makeup.

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.119
- Right?
- Yes.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.788
- These days, grooming...
- Yes.

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.259
Has become the norm.

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:00.859
Exactly.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.558
(9am, 1st floor common area)

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:07.139
(Sang Hyeon comes downstairs first after getting ready.)

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:11.439
(Looking around)

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.239
(Glancing)

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.319
(Glancing)

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:22.848
He's looking for someone.

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.289
(Sang Hyeon is looking for someone.)

00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:26.648
What do you have for breakfast?

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.258
(Last night)

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.319
I have Greek yogurt.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.659
(Listening)

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:32.159
I love Greek yogurt too.

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:35.259
- I'll make it for breakfast.
- Sounds good.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.998
I'll slice some fruit in.

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:42.599
(He recalls the breakfast promise.)

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:46.839
(However, no one is on the 1st floor.)

00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:48.838
(In front of the older women's room)

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:51.309
(Knocking)

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:53.819
Oh, my.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.648
- Are they sleeping?
- None of the older women are up?

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:58.649
(The older women are still asleep.)

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.289
(Disappointed)

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.688
Sang Hyeon is like,

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:09.758
"But you promised to make yogurt for breakfast. Where are you?"

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.898
Isn't he just a puppy?

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:12.799
(A sulking puppy actually exists.)

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:17.938
(Eating a banana instead of Greek yogurt by himself)

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:19.239
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:23.679
(Sulking)

00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:25.978
Are they all sleeping?

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:27.519
(Looking around)

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:32.249
There are bananas. Have some.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.819
No rush.

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:41.729
Did you go to the rooftop yesterday?

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.069
The rooftop? Yes.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:46.629
- Did you see it?
- I did.

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:48.769
What did you think?

00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:53.878
(0 votes, 1 vote)

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.679
It got me thinking a lot.

00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:57.079
Right.

00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:02.319
(It also got Sang Won thinking a lot.)

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:05.249
I bet one guy got all the votes.

00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:10.189
Is it Mu Jin or Hyeon Jun?

00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:14.929
(Suddenly laughing)

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:27.908
(10am, Yeong Gyeong gets up.)

00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:29.909
(Stretching)

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.779
(A sip of water)

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:37.689
The older women have their own morning routines.

00:09:37.819 --> 00:09:40.659
(Touching the flower)

00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:45.389
(Greeting her comfort doll)

00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:47.998
She's lighting a scented candle.

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:49.929
(Aromatherapy candle)

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.899
- What?
- Goodness.

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:52.999
That's impressive.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.480
(The older women welcome the morning with their own routines.)

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:59.508
(The younger men have all gathered on the 1st floor.)

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:02.139
(Yeong Gyeong appears.)

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:06.009
(The older women come down after getting ready.)

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:08.519
Hi.

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.788
Hi.

00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:12.818
(Bowing)

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:14.319
(Smiling)

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.329
(Staring)

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:19.829
Did you eat something?

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:21.699
- No, not yet.
- No?

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.799
Granola and nuts.

00:10:25.869 --> 00:10:27.169
Where was that banana?

00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:28.999
This banana? Over here.

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:31.109
- I want one too.
- Me too.

00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:32.939
Greek yogurt with bananas is amazing.

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:38.849
(Their hands touched slightly.)

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:41.518
- Oranges? I'm in.
- Me too.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:42.819
I'm fine with oranges too.

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:47.259
(Glancing)

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:50.689
(Turning around)

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:56.128
(Mu Jin's eyes are following Bon Hee.)

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:57.199
He's watching her.

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:03.699
(Glancing)

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:07.069
(This time, Bon Hee looks toward Mu Jin.)

00:11:07.909 --> 00:11:10.479
(As promised, Yeong Gyeong prepares Greek yogurt.)

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:13.349
Hi.

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.619
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:21.019
Didn't we say breakfast would be at 10am or something?

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:24.829
Are you a hardcore judger? I'm sorry.

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:28.159
No, well...

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.669
(Blushing)

00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:35.398
He must've been waiting. His face is beet red.

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.469
Oh, no.

00:11:38.309 --> 00:11:39.309
How cute.

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:40.678
Right?

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:43.239
(The older women find him adorable.)

00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:46.678
At least she's making it...

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:48.749
- right now.
- Oh, right.

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.689
(Touching his nose)

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.719
Let's go.

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:59.859
(The first breakfast at Yeon House)

00:12:00.729 --> 00:12:02.699
(Yeong Gyeong's pretty fruit plating)

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:05.669
(Cereal, granola, milk, and Greek yogurt)

00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:08.269
Do we sit wherever we want?

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:11.609
(Walking on eggshells)

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:13.508
It looks good.

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.339
(Ji Won heads straight to the far end.)

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:20.108
Are you sitting there today?

00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:21.779
I'm further inside today.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:25.819
(Last night's dinner)

00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:30.759
(Mu Jin, Ji Won)

00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:33.388
(Glancing)

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:36.428
Mu Jin seems really relaxed.

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:38.699
Seeing that...

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:42.139
(Wanting to talk to Mu Jin, )

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:45.769
(Ji Won chose a seat that might be close to him.)

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:49.109
(Mu Jin heads to the dining table.)

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:52.909
(Hesitating)

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:54.979
(Glancing)

00:12:56.619 --> 00:12:57.989
(Glancing again)

00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:01.529
- Will he sit next to her?
- Here he goes.

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:03.689
- He's turning.
- There he goes.

00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:06.289
- It's the opposite side.
- Yes.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:09.099
(Mu Jin sits in the same seat as last night.)

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:11.999
(Smiling)

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.269
The eggs have been boiled to perfection.

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:15.739
Look at them steaming.

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:18.868
- Would you like an egg?
- Can I have one?

00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:20.239
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.308
(Smiling)

00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:23.379
Thank you.

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:27.248
(Glancing)

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.079
(Ji Won unconsciously leans her body toward Mu Jin.)

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:33.248
They can kind of guess...

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:35.889
who chose whom last night.

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:39.259
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.559
How much milk would you like?

00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:45.599
- Just enough?
- Yes.

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:47.439
(Smiling)

00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:49.269
(Glancing)

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.869
(Mu Jin naturally takes care of Bon Hee first.)

00:13:57.709 --> 00:13:59.578
(Mu Jin closes the bottle.)

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:00.879
He only took care of Bon Hee.

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:06.089
Pour the milk if you're eating cereal.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.388
(Earlier in the kitchen)

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:14.358
Who is having cereal?

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:15.398
Me.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:16.399
(Raising her hand)

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:18.899
Would you like milk and cereal?

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:20.728
- Three.
- Three?

00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.199
- Nice.
- They look like soup bowls.

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.209
He forgot.

00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:26.539
How disappointing.

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.209
Would you like some fruit?

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.979
We should have a bit of Greek yogurt.

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:36.579
I should have a taste, so just a tiny bit.

00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:39.849
(Reading the mood)

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.629
Thanks.

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:48.729
(Reading the room)

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:56.199
(Topping her yogurt with fruit)

00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:59.429
(The older women seem familiar with enjoying Greek yogurt.)

00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:00.739
(On the other hand, the younger men...)

00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:01.739
(Hesitant)

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:05.149
The younger men aren't used to Greek yogurt.

00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:07.278
(Tasting)

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:09.278
(Moaning)

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:10.879
So, this is what it usually tastes like.

00:15:11.289 --> 00:15:13.418
They're so cute.

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:16.019
Why does it feel like this is my first time?

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:19.859
- It doesn't taste good by itself.
- Oh, you're supposed to top it.

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:22.099
(Finding him cute)

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:24.999
(A little embarrassed)

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:27.399
What time did you go to bed?

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:30.399
We stayed awake until around 3:30am.

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:32.209
We went to bed at around 4am.

00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:35.309
Are we allowed on the third floor?

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:40.279
Last night, I went to bring you water.

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:42.429
He said you were on your foam roller.

00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:44.849
Excuse me.

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:46.289
That's enough.

00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:49.789
(The 2nd-floor communal space last night)

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:52.329
(Ye Eun stretches her whole body.)

00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:54.958
(Sang Hyeon enters.)

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:55.959
Excuse...

00:15:56.529 --> 00:15:57.699
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:00.429
I thought I should give you water.

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:02.598
I didn't want to bother anyone.

00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:04.439
(Sang Hyeon and Ye Eun ran into each other.)

00:16:04.909 --> 00:16:06.568
(Embarrassed)

00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.379
(Their hands are touching.)

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:11.409
- That's enough.
- Sorry.

00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:15.279
She grabbed his hand like this.

00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:18.349
Should she have grabbed it like this?

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:21.619
Still... You don't find that strange?

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:24.088
Not really. It seems fine to me.

00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:27.129
It doesn't mean anything significant.

00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:30.498
If I were him, I would have thought she was into me.

00:16:30.499 --> 00:16:31.598
Exactly.

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:33.099
(It's that serious?)

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:34.438
(Shy)

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:35.439
(She stops him as she's embarrassed.)

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.869
(Their hands are touching.)

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:39.868
- That's enough.
- Okay.

00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:41.439
- Sorry.
- You told everyone?

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.939
- I...
- Did he tell everyone?

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:46.049
He said you were startled.

00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:47.648
I couldn't go in.

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:50.079
I felt too guilty to go there this morning.

00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:59.929
(And it's silent once again.)

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.829
(Reading the room)

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:05.679
Should we talk about our blood types?

00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:07.639
Blood types?

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:09.839
That's so random.

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:11.869
(That's pretty random.)

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.679
My blood type is A.

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:16.738
(Embarrassed)

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:18.848
- Type A?
- Yes. Don't I look it?

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.179
You don't.

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:22.119
- What do I look like?
- Type O.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.319
(What are they talking about?)

00:17:28.989 --> 00:17:30.659
(Watching others' reactions)

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:33.558
May I ask you what the blood types mean?

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:35.259
We don't know what they mean.

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:37.599
It's just that she's cheerful.

00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:40.029
Ji Won also looks like a type O.

00:17:40.869 --> 00:17:42.638
- I'm type A.
- Seriously?

00:17:42.639 --> 00:17:44.769
- Yes.
- So am I.

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.039
(Startled)

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:47.039
So am I.

00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:49.008
- What?
- Really?

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:50.538
(All the older women are type A.)

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:53.578
Which type does type A go well with?

00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:55.249
- Type O.
- Type O?

00:17:55.749 --> 00:17:58.319
Is that a thing? I've never heard that before.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:00.618
(He's type O.)

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:01.659
That's nice.

00:18:02.089 --> 00:18:04.989
(Sang Won is glad that he's blood type O.)

00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:06.859
I knew you'd be type O.

00:18:07.829 --> 00:18:11.769
Don't you feel comfortable talking to him?

00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:14.098
Doesn't he make you feel comfortable?

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:15.169
(Agreeing)

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:17.519
So, that was because of my blood type.

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:24.648
The younger men don't understand why they're asking blood types.

00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:27.178
We used to talk about personalities based on blood types...

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:28.979
back in elementary school, but...

00:18:29.249 --> 00:18:31.818
- You did talk about it.
- But it was so long ago...

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.389
that I vaguely remember it now.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.758
Judging from how Sang Hyeon doesn't know anything,

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:40.158
- he may be younger than me.
- No way.

00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:41.598
He might be younger.

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:42.658
- I think he is.
- I don't think so.

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.229
He might be in his early 20s.

00:18:45.369 --> 00:18:49.199
For him to be more than 12 years younger...

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:50.915
- He should be around that age.
- He should be.

00:18:50.939 --> 00:18:52.308
- He could be.
- If the woman is 35,

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:56.438
- the man has to be 23 or 24.
- Right.

00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:57.978
Before MBTI types,

00:18:57.979 --> 00:18:59.708
we tried to figure out people's personalities...

00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:01.419
through blood types.

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:03.649
(I see.)

00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:06.119
(Nodding)

00:19:06.219 --> 00:19:08.419
I'll take all the plates.

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:10.589
No, let's clean up together.

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:15.458
(The breakfast ends while they fail to bring generations together.)

00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:16.998
(Mu Jin and Sang Won's room)

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:18.869
I wonder what they do for a living.

00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:20.569
It completely changes their image.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:24.368
Ye Eun looks like...

00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:26.169
a violinist or something.

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.709
She said she's been doing her hobby for a long time...

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.379
and that it was related to her job.

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:34.718
That's why I think she plays an instrument.

00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:37.018
- In music?
- She must play an instrument.

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:38.249
Or she's...

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.158
a ballerina. I have a feeling she's a dancer.

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:42.719
- Dance?
- Yes.

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:45.229
One of them is definitely a dancer.

00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:46.729
- A dancer?
- A dancer?

00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:49.658
Ji Won has a way...

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:52.229
- of coddling you.
- Right.

00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:54.698
So, she might be a teacher.

00:19:54.699 --> 00:19:56.968
Her job must involve...

00:19:56.969 --> 00:19:58.709
dealing with kids.

00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:02.508
- Maybe...
- Or she's an announcer.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:03.509
Right?

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:06.979
Ji Won is a good driver.

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:09.279
I can tell.

00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:12.819
(When Ji Won and Sang Won first met)

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:16.289
(You're driving with one hand, so I can trust you more.)

00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:17.619
(One hand?)

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.628
(I believe in you.)

00:20:18.629 --> 00:20:20.159
(I'll relax now.)

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:24.229
(She naturally showed her driving skills.)

00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:25.428
Once I saw her car,

00:20:25.429 --> 00:20:28.069
I instantly knew that she was into cars.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.299
- Really?
- Was it a Wrangler?

00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:32.209
No. It's a BMW.

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:35.409
- It is?
- But it's...

00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:36.879
- BMW M?
- Wait.

00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:38.378
(Startled)

00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:39.848
- It's a BMW M?
- It is.

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:41.778
(Amazed)

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:42.848
As soon as I got into her car,

00:20:42.849 --> 00:20:44.888
I said, "I can tell that you're into cars,"

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:46.819
- and she said, "Not at all." - Ji Won?

00:20:47.719 --> 00:20:49.559
- Ji Won.
- Wait.

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:52.788
Don't tell me you're tempted by her car.

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:53.859
No.

00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:57.898
Your impression of her changes...

00:20:57.899 --> 00:20:59.428
once you realize she's into cars.

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:00.468
(Agreeing)

00:21:00.469 --> 00:21:01.539
It was new.

00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:06.009
What if they're all...

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:09.238
lawyers or business owners?

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:11.679
Maybe they're at that level.

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:14.208
I'm worried they might be...

00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:16.248
extremely capable, earning a high income.

00:21:16.249 --> 00:21:17.995
(They're almost worried about their competence.)

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:19.689
I prefer someone similar to my level.

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:22.419
Right. If we're way too apart...

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.189
I wanted to ask you.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:27.588
If your girlfriend, or to go further, your wife,

00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:32.169
made far more money than you, how would you feel?

00:21:32.629 --> 00:21:34.638
Are you asking if I'd be a house husband?

00:21:34.639 --> 00:21:37.738
I just want to know your thoughts. Is it even better for you?

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:39.285
I have to be the one making more in the relationship.

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:40.468
I also wish I'd make more.

00:21:40.469 --> 00:21:41.879
- Right?
- I think...

00:21:42.179 --> 00:21:44.679
I aspire to be the head of the household.

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:48.979
The best case for me is that we make similar income.

00:21:49.179 --> 00:21:51.288
I'm sure...

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:54.049
it'll hit you hard in reality.

00:21:54.889 --> 00:21:58.089
Say you're preparing to go on a trip together.

00:21:58.389 --> 00:22:02.159
And you see her naturally booking a business-class flight.

00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.568
I'd go, "Isn't that too expensive?"

00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:08.298
But it might be ordinary for her.

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:09.369
That could happen.

00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:11.969
I'd definitely feel intimidated then.

00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:14.039
That's why I also prefer making similar incomes.

00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:17.809
When you want to lead as a man,

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:19.608
it's natural to be intimidated...

00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:21.179
if she makes far more money than you.

00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:24.048
I wonder what their jobs are.

00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:26.018
(They're curious and worried.)

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:28.488
That sounded like it came from his experience.

00:22:28.489 --> 00:22:30.919
(The younger men have an honest chat.)

00:22:30.959 --> 00:22:32.459
I get it, though.

00:22:33.089 --> 00:22:35.028
- Even I'd be intimidated.
- Right?

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:38.368
- Considering their ages, - Really?

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:40.369
They would be entry-level workers at best.

00:22:40.469 --> 00:22:43.139
- Or they might be a job seeker.
- That's true.

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:47.368
And none of them will want to rely on their partners...

00:22:47.369 --> 00:22:49.309
- when they go on dates.
- Indeed.

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:52.878
But if your girlfriend makes way more...

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:54.148
Would you be daunted?

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:58.088
They would be expecting a simple date like eating gimbap.

00:22:58.089 --> 00:22:59.488
- And if she's cutting steaks, - Right.

00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:00.948
- I'd feel...
- That's true.

00:23:00.949 --> 00:23:04.018
Burdened to pay for it.

00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:06.339
(The psychological burden that comes from a financial gap)

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:10.659
Did you get a text?

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:13.569
They asked us to come to the swimming pool.

00:23:13.699 --> 00:23:15.599
They want the men to come.

00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:17.538
- Right now?
- Right now?

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:18.885
(The men will gather by the pool.)

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:19.909
Am I the only one who got it?

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.355
- Everyone got it, right?
- I got it too.

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:23.878
(What is this about?)

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:24.979
Let's go.

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:36.219
(He spots something.)

00:23:36.459 --> 00:23:39.259
"Please check once everyone arrives."

00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:40.529
What's this now?

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:44.329
Let's open it.

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:47.999
(Looking forward to it)

00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:49.999
I'll open it.

00:23:52.509 --> 00:23:55.209
(Curious)

00:24:01.379 --> 00:24:04.448
"The men will ask them out in five minutes."

00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:08.318
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:09.858
"You only get one chance,"

00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:12.099
"and you'll be matched on a 1st-come, 1st-served basis."

00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:17.759
(Grinning)

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:19.599
(Getting up)

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:23.139
(Mu Jin gets up as if he's been waiting for it.)

00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:26.737
"The men will ask them out in five minutes."

00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:28.707
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

00:24:28.708 --> 00:24:30.767
(The men will ask them out in 5 minutes.)

00:24:30.768 --> 00:24:32.037
"You only get one chance,"

00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:33.977
"and you'll be matched on a 1st-come, 1st-served basis."

00:24:33.978 --> 00:24:35.477
(You only get one chance, )

00:24:35.478 --> 00:24:37.878
(and you'll be matched on a first-come, first-served basis.)

00:24:38.718 --> 00:24:39.878
(Grinning)

00:24:40.878 --> 00:24:41.888
(Getting up)

00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:45.118
(Mu Jin gets up as if he's been waiting for it.)

00:24:45.418 --> 00:24:46.958
He gets up that fast?

00:24:47.258 --> 00:24:49.288
He's a racehorse who only goes forward.

00:24:50.058 --> 00:24:51.897
(He strides without even looking back.)

00:24:51.898 --> 00:24:53.897
I thought I'd stand a chance...

00:24:53.898 --> 00:24:55.967
only if I hurried up.

00:24:55.968 --> 00:24:57.228
That's why I went so fast.

00:24:59.868 --> 00:25:01.707
(Walking up)

00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:03.868
(He goes straight to where his girl is.)

00:25:04.508 --> 00:25:07.108
I want to get to know her better.

00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:10.477
(Knocking)

00:25:10.478 --> 00:25:12.518
- Can I open it?
- Yes, you can.

00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:16.417
(The older woman that Mu Jin wants to get to know)

00:25:16.418 --> 00:25:17.788
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:21.958
(It was Bon Hee.)

00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:27.057
Do you want to go on a date with me today?

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:30.968
(Do you want to go on a date with me today?)

00:25:31.168 --> 00:25:32.237
(Nodding)

00:25:32.238 --> 00:25:33.238
Okay.

00:25:35.538 --> 00:25:37.808
Mu Jin is so cute.

00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:43.147
It made me feel good.

00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:44.918
I was probably smiling without realizing it.

00:25:45.348 --> 00:25:47.147
It made my heart flutter.

00:25:47.148 --> 00:25:48.417
You make this older woman's heart flutter.

00:25:48.418 --> 00:25:51.087
Yes, that's the charm of a younger guy.

00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:52.088
- Right.
- I think so.

00:25:52.089 --> 00:25:54.657
They ask you out all of a sudden...

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:57.327
- when they don't know much.
- Yes, they're straightforward.

00:25:57.328 --> 00:25:58.358
Exactly.

00:25:59.528 --> 00:26:02.727
(Hyeon Jun followed Mu Jin.)

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.897
I thought the one I liked...

00:26:04.898 --> 00:26:07.398
would have attracted someone else.

00:26:07.638 --> 00:26:10.168
- That's cool.
- Who is he going to?

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:14.708
Can I come in?

00:26:16.048 --> 00:26:17.378
Yes, come in.

00:26:18.418 --> 00:26:19.518
Oh, this was your room?

00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:22.987
Do you want to go on a date with me?

00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:26.488
(Do you want to go on a date with me?)

00:26:27.058 --> 00:26:28.387
Oh, okay.

00:26:28.388 --> 00:26:29.428
Good.

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.328
- Did you just ask me out?
- Yes.

00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:33.357
(Embarrassed)

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:34.997
(Hyeon Jun chose Yeong Gyeong.)

00:26:34.998 --> 00:26:36.098
Okay, then.

00:26:36.998 --> 00:26:38.367
Who's that behind him?

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:40.237
- Isn't that Sang Won?
- It is.

00:26:40.238 --> 00:26:41.767
Ye Eun, will you go out with me?

00:26:41.768 --> 00:26:45.238
(Ye Eun, will you go out with me?)

00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:47.178
(Nodding)

00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:48.547
Good.

00:26:48.548 --> 00:26:51.518
(Sang Won chose Ye Eun.)

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:54.218
- Seriously?
- She accepted.

00:26:54.418 --> 00:26:55.617
- What? Oh, no.
- Wait!

00:26:55.618 --> 00:26:56.988
(Sang Won's unexpected choice)

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:58.757
It was Sang Won, not Sang Hyeon.

00:26:58.758 --> 00:26:59.887
- Sang Won.
- It was Sang Won.

00:26:59.888 --> 00:27:00.988
It was Sang Won.

00:27:04.428 --> 00:27:05.598
I was surprised.

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:10.198
I never expected Sang Won to ask me out.

00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:13.937
Sang Hyeon...

00:27:13.938 --> 00:27:18.138
stayed by my side and looked after me.

00:27:18.608 --> 00:27:20.838
I had a feeling that Sang Hyeon would ask me out.

00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:22.808
That was my guess.

00:27:22.878 --> 00:27:24.678
Sang Won started making a move.

00:27:25.648 --> 00:27:30.018
(Hyeon Jun and Sang Won returned to their room.)

00:27:33.888 --> 00:27:35.087
Is this how we do it?

00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:37.188
Didn't we look so lame, though?

00:27:37.798 --> 00:27:40.197
I looked like I just followed you there.

00:27:40.198 --> 00:27:41.968
But I did go there to ask Ye Eun.

00:27:42.468 --> 00:27:44.737
I just asked her if she wanted to go on a date.

00:27:44.738 --> 00:27:46.667
I looked, and she was there, so I asked her out.

00:27:46.668 --> 00:27:49.267
I'm afraid I wasn't polite enough.

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:51.114
(This younger guy is worried that he was rude.)

00:27:51.138 --> 00:27:52.577
You can be polite while you're on the date.

00:27:52.578 --> 00:27:53.578
That's true.

00:27:54.608 --> 00:27:56.777
- No, that is how you do it.
- That's cute.

00:27:56.778 --> 00:27:59.048
- You're right. They were so cute.
- They were.

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.387
See? They act first.

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:02.517
- Yes.
- Exactly.

00:28:02.518 --> 00:28:04.534
- They think after they act.
- "Did we look too lame?"

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.458
And that's what older women are into.

00:28:07.858 --> 00:28:10.428
Wait. What happens to Sang Hyeon, then?

00:28:11.628 --> 00:28:14.227
(What's Sang Hyeon doing in the meantime?)

00:28:14.228 --> 00:28:16.098
Who did you ask out? Bon Hee?

00:28:16.368 --> 00:28:17.368
Me?

00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:19.038
Bon Hee.

00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:28.348
(When they got up and left one by one, )

00:28:29.748 --> 00:28:34.048
(Sang Hyeon was the last one to stand up.)

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:44.128
(Who will he pick?)

00:28:50.568 --> 00:28:51.668
Ji Won?

00:28:52.868 --> 00:28:54.397
Will you go with me?

00:28:54.398 --> 00:28:58.437
(Will you go with me?)

00:28:58.438 --> 00:29:00.537
- Now?
- No, I meant on a date.

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:01.608
Okay.

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.248
She said, "Now?"

00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:06.078
(Sang Heyon picked...)

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:08.318
- Good.
- Okay.

00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:09.487
What was that about?

00:29:09.488 --> 00:29:11.818
(Sang Heyon picked Ji Won.)

00:29:12.688 --> 00:29:17.658
(All the younger men asked them out.)

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:23.827
(The brave younger guy will get the older woman of his choice.)

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:28.467
Sang Hyeon looked conflicted.

00:29:28.468 --> 00:29:29.567
- Right.
- You're right.

00:29:29.568 --> 00:29:32.138
Who did you think he was going to ask out?

00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:34.507
He probably had feelings for Bon Hee.

00:29:34.508 --> 00:29:36.807
He would have stood up instantly if he wanted to pick Ye Eun.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.177
In that situation,

00:29:38.178 --> 00:29:42.447
who you were with on the first private date...

00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:44.858
- takes up a huge part.
- Right.

00:29:45.218 --> 00:29:47.217
The two are starting to be...

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:48.527
an official couple.

00:29:48.528 --> 00:29:50.728
Mu Jin and Bon Hee, I mean.

00:29:51.028 --> 00:29:54.498
So, Sang Hyeon couldn't do anything...

00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:56.467
because of Mu Jin.

00:29:56.468 --> 00:29:58.597
He knew who Mu Jin was choosing,

00:29:58.598 --> 00:30:02.707
and it was the woman he was interested in.

00:30:02.708 --> 00:30:03.807
What makes you think...

00:30:03.808 --> 00:30:06.038
that Sang Hyeon is interested in Bon Hee...

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:08.078
all of a sudden?

00:30:08.508 --> 00:30:09.948
Because he didn't get up right away.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:11.617
- That's why?
- And he asked...

00:30:11.618 --> 00:30:13.278
Mu Jin who he picked.

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:14.917
He was making sure.

00:30:14.918 --> 00:30:16.788
- Right. Exactly.
- Anyway.

00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:19.088
I'm excited.

00:30:22.328 --> 00:30:26.397
(The first date, Mu Jin and Bon Hee)

00:30:26.398 --> 00:30:28.998
We're dressed similarly, though.

00:30:29.498 --> 00:30:30.598
That's good.

00:30:31.998 --> 00:30:33.318
They're wearing matching outfits.

00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:38.007
- What's so similar?
- They don't look so similar.

00:30:38.008 --> 00:30:40.708
(They're off to a fresh start, claiming they're dressed similarly.)

00:30:41.848 --> 00:30:43.007
Aren't you curious about what we're doing?

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.148
I'm so curious.

00:30:45.778 --> 00:30:47.278
Do you know our destination?

00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:50.688
Deokso? Have you heard of it?

00:30:51.088 --> 00:30:52.957
(Shaking her head)

00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:54.217
That's where we're going.

00:30:54.218 --> 00:30:55.928
(We're going to Deokso.)

00:30:58.328 --> 00:31:04.568
(She follows him, only knowing the destination.)

00:31:05.198 --> 00:31:06.918
Do you regularly use public transportation?

00:31:07.538 --> 00:31:08.907
Rarely.

00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:10.167
You always drive your car around?

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:13.078
(Mu Jin's first event)

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:15.548
Oh, they're taking the bus.

00:31:15.578 --> 00:31:16.578
(Romantic bus stop date)

00:31:18.278 --> 00:31:20.978
The last time I took the bus was like ten years ago.

00:31:21.218 --> 00:31:22.687
I own a car,

00:31:22.688 --> 00:31:25.487
so I normally drive my car instead of taking the bus.

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:29.458
When he said we were taking the bus, I got excited.

00:31:30.458 --> 00:31:34.098
(This older woman is excited about taking the bus after 10 years.)

00:31:34.568 --> 00:31:36.328
- Do you know what number it is?
- Yes.

00:31:36.898 --> 00:31:38.698
This one. "Thank you."

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:40.797
(Amazed)

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:42.638
- It's 58-3.
- I can't believe they have this.

00:31:43.808 --> 00:31:45.108
I should take a photo.

00:31:47.108 --> 00:31:50.578
(She takes a photo of the bus route she'll be on with Mu Jin.)

00:31:51.148 --> 00:31:52.648
I want to take a photo of this too.

00:31:54.888 --> 00:31:56.818
- Oh, me?
- Well...

00:31:59.458 --> 00:32:01.157
- What is this?
- Hold up.

00:32:01.158 --> 00:32:02.588
That line was...

00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:05.127
Did you see him looking back, saying, "Oh, me?"

00:32:05.128 --> 00:32:06.928
(Mu Jin picked it up immediately.)

00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:09.168
I want to take a photo of this too.

00:32:11.498 --> 00:32:13.268
- Oh, me?
- Well...

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:15.737
Scooch to the right.

00:32:15.738 --> 00:32:17.168
- To the right?
- Yes, that's it.

00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:18.877
A little to the left.

00:32:18.878 --> 00:32:20.807
- No, the other way.
- This way?

00:32:20.808 --> 00:32:21.848
Yes.

00:32:23.248 --> 00:32:24.318
Good.

00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:28.318
Can you show me your profile?

00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:29.688
(My profile?)

00:32:30.088 --> 00:32:31.318
(A slight turn)

00:32:31.588 --> 00:32:32.658
Good.

00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:35.727
(Embarrassed for some reason)

00:32:35.728 --> 00:32:36.828
I took it.

00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:41.598
(Bon Hee's first photo of Mu Jin)

00:32:50.038 --> 00:32:51.508
(Tapping)

00:32:52.108 --> 00:32:53.677
(Staring)

00:32:53.678 --> 00:32:55.878
I have a handkerchief. Do you want it?

00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:57.678
You do?

00:32:58.278 --> 00:32:59.948
Thank you. It's hot.

00:33:00.318 --> 00:33:02.218
Keep it in your pocket.

00:33:03.018 --> 00:33:04.488
You'll need it for your sweat.

00:33:04.718 --> 00:33:06.317
I'll wash it and give it back to you later.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.388
Okay. Dab this area too. Around your jawline.

00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:11.398
(Getting something)

00:33:12.928 --> 00:33:14.597
That's what older women do.

00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:15.728
- Is it?
- Yes.

00:33:15.998 --> 00:33:18.797
They give you everything. They ask, "Are you hot?"

00:33:18.798 --> 00:33:21.068
(He cools down using Bon Hee's fan and handkerchief.)

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:25.378
- There's our bus.
- What is that bus?

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.307
(Amazed)

00:33:28.308 --> 00:33:29.948
- This is fascinating.
- "Thank You Bus?"

00:33:30.918 --> 00:33:32.917
They'll have to sit in the back if they want to sit together.

00:33:32.918 --> 00:33:34.247
(It's obviously extraordinary.)

00:33:34.248 --> 00:33:35.317
That's what it looks like?

00:33:35.318 --> 00:33:37.288
- That's so impressive.
- Hello.

00:33:41.658 --> 00:33:43.288
This is fascinating.

00:33:46.298 --> 00:33:48.098
I didn't know there was such a bus like this.

00:33:48.998 --> 00:33:51.538
(Sitting closely together)

00:33:56.408 --> 00:33:58.238
(Thank You 58-3)

00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:06.548
(The romantic route that goes along the river)

00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:14.158
How was your first impression of me?

00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:15.538
My first impression of you?

00:34:17.558 --> 00:34:18.558
You were pretty.

00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:25.338
I feel shy. Right.

00:34:25.598 --> 00:34:28.268
I was surprised, to be honest.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.438
You didn't expect much?

00:34:31.578 --> 00:34:33.677
- I was very excited.
- I see.

00:34:33.678 --> 00:34:35.007
I was really excited,

00:34:35.008 --> 00:34:39.178
wondering what kind of people I would meet.

00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:41.018
I was surprised when I saw you.

00:34:45.088 --> 00:34:46.988
I had no expectations.

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.278
- So I liked you.
- You had no expectations?

00:34:49.528 --> 00:34:51.028
With no expectations,

00:34:51.658 --> 00:34:54.328
I kept driving to go there to meet you.

00:34:55.068 --> 00:34:56.797
(Oh, my. He seems great.)

00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:57.938
And that made me happy.

00:34:59.268 --> 00:35:04.338
(They liked each other when they first met.)

00:35:05.808 --> 00:35:08.178
I want to take a photo of you. Can you sit over there?

00:35:08.478 --> 00:35:11.047
You'll look great if I take a photo from this angle.

00:35:11.048 --> 00:35:14.278
(Mu Jin gets up right away and moves to the seat.)

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:15.948
How should I pose?

00:35:16.888 --> 00:35:18.388
Just sit comfortably.

00:35:20.258 --> 00:35:21.258
(She takes a photo and saves it in her heart.)

00:35:21.259 --> 00:35:22.557
They look great together.

00:35:22.558 --> 00:35:24.038
- They look great together.
- Indeed.

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:25.828
Can you turn your head a little bit more?

00:35:27.328 --> 00:35:29.227
I need to see your face from a side view.

00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:30.267
Can you look ahead?

00:35:30.268 --> 00:35:31.268
- Ahead?
- Yes.

00:35:31.798 --> 00:35:33.838
Can you lean slightly? Good.

00:35:34.268 --> 00:35:35.837
(Passionate)

00:35:35.838 --> 00:35:37.708
I want to keep taking until I get a good one.

00:35:38.208 --> 00:35:41.508
(He does just as Bon Hee asks.)

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:45.618
Bon Hee's dimple is getting deeper.

00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:47.917
(Click)

00:35:47.918 --> 00:35:48.918
(Click)

00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:49.988
It's done.

00:35:51.518 --> 00:35:53.158
- Did I look okay?
- You did a great job.

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.427
Posing for a photo...

00:35:55.428 --> 00:35:56.958
is not an easy thing to do.

00:35:57.058 --> 00:35:58.197
It makes you nervous.

00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.457
- And we're on a bus...
- I'll take photos of you later.

00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:00.758
I'm okay.

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.597
I'm fine. You don't have to do that.

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:04.158
I'll take a lot of photos of you later.

00:36:04.368 --> 00:36:06.168
I like taking photos.

00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:11.178
So I often take photos of the people I like.

00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:14.338
"The people she likes."

00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:18.047
(Right in front of her, )

00:36:18.048 --> 00:36:22.448
(there's a person she likes.)

00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:24.918
I'll have a look at the photos you took later.

00:36:25.588 --> 00:36:27.388
(Chuckling awkwardly)

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:28.558
Okay.

00:36:30.158 --> 00:36:32.027
When I take photos of people, they use their photos...

00:36:32.028 --> 00:36:34.098
as their profile photos on social media.

00:36:34.428 --> 00:36:35.597
Really?

00:36:35.598 --> 00:36:38.798
Like those platforms... Buddy... No, not Buddy Buddy.

00:36:38.898 --> 00:36:39.938
Cyworld?

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.407
Buddy Buddy and Cyworld.

00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:44.137
No, I didn't mean to say Buddy Buddy.

00:36:44.138 --> 00:36:45.277
"Buddy Buddy?"

00:36:45.278 --> 00:36:46.354
(She can't believe her ears.)

00:36:46.378 --> 00:36:48.848
- What does it mean? "Buddy Buddy?" - "Buddy Buddy?"

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:51.438
- Why did she mention it suddenly?
- I'm worried.

00:36:51.818 --> 00:36:53.018
She must've been born in 1983.

00:36:54.618 --> 00:36:55.717
- Really?
- She must be 42 or 43.

00:36:55.718 --> 00:36:57.717
No. I was born in 1989, and I used Buddy Buddy.

00:36:57.718 --> 00:36:59.418
- Really?
- What about you, SOOBIN?

00:36:59.658 --> 00:37:01.828
I only know the name.

00:37:02.558 --> 00:37:03.787
Where did you hear of it?

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.697
My older sister was born in 1990.

00:37:05.698 --> 00:37:07.327
She's ten years older than me.

00:37:07.328 --> 00:37:09.827
Do you think your sister is around Bon Hee's age?

00:37:09.828 --> 00:37:12.198
How old does she look to you?

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:15.337
She definitely looks younger than my sister.

00:37:15.338 --> 00:37:16.367
Come on.

00:37:16.368 --> 00:37:18.378
You'll be in trouble when your sister sees this.

00:37:19.438 --> 00:37:22.448
Like those platforms... Buddy... No, not Buddy Buddy.

00:37:22.678 --> 00:37:23.708
Cyworld?

00:37:24.678 --> 00:37:26.177
Buddy Buddy and Cyworld.

00:37:26.178 --> 00:37:27.917
No, I didn't mean to say Buddy Buddy.

00:37:27.918 --> 00:37:30.617
They put their photos on their Instagram profile.

00:37:30.618 --> 00:37:31.698
(Making up for her mistake)

00:37:32.718 --> 00:37:33.787
(Realizing)

00:37:33.788 --> 00:37:34.858
Platforms like that.

00:37:35.528 --> 00:37:36.588
Oh, I see.

00:37:37.028 --> 00:37:38.597
(I feel so hot.)

00:37:38.598 --> 00:37:39.828
She's flustered.

00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:42.398
I'm blushing.

00:37:45.098 --> 00:37:46.268
Did you use Buddy Buddy too?

00:37:47.038 --> 00:37:48.038
Do you know what it is?

00:37:48.208 --> 00:37:50.138
You don't look like you know it.

00:37:50.438 --> 00:37:51.838
(Oh, boy)

00:37:52.838 --> 00:37:55.248
I've heard of it before.

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.677
He's heard of it.

00:37:57.678 --> 00:37:59.777
I did feel the difference then.

00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.618
I felt a generation gap.

00:38:01.718 --> 00:38:03.418
I realized...

00:38:04.718 --> 00:38:06.088
that we had quite a big age gap.

00:38:07.788 --> 00:38:08.988
Don't you want to know my age?

00:38:09.858 --> 00:38:12.357
Well, I can tell your age roughly.

00:38:12.358 --> 00:38:13.498
- Really?
- Yes.

00:38:16.768 --> 00:38:19.838
Do you think an age gap matters in a relationship?

00:38:20.438 --> 00:38:22.208
- Do I think that matters?
- Yes.

00:38:24.808 --> 00:38:27.178
I tended to think of younger men...

00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:32.478
like little brothers, not thinking of them romantically.

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:36.388
A man in his early or mid-20s is too young.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.988
But for example...

00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:40.818
A man older than that...

00:38:41.428 --> 00:38:43.927
would have enough life experience,

00:38:43.928 --> 00:38:45.558
and so I wouldn't mind dating him.

00:38:47.398 --> 00:38:50.328
(Mu Jin seems to have mixed feelings.)

00:38:50.468 --> 00:38:54.467
Oh, no. How big of an age gap do they have?

00:38:54.468 --> 00:38:56.114
I don't think they have such a big age gap.

00:38:56.138 --> 00:38:58.377
- I think they have a big age gap.
- Really?

00:38:58.378 --> 00:39:00.207
I think she's around eight years older than him.

00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:01.407
- Eight years?
- Yes.

00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:02.684
(Hye Jin assumes that Mu Jin and Bon Hee have an 8-year age gap.)

00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:04.307
But aside from that,

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:07.578
it's hard for me to develop feelings for someone.

00:39:08.488 --> 00:39:10.218
So I think it's more important.

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:15.728
So the age gap doesn't matter?

00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:17.858
I think I wouldn't mind.

00:39:18.528 --> 00:39:21.098
I don't know how much younger you are than me.

00:39:21.398 --> 00:39:23.028
The younger, the better.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:24.898
What are the good things?

00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:28.208
A younger man is not picky...

00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:30.737
Younger men are not picky?

00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:32.037
- I mean, less picky...
- Really?

00:39:32.038 --> 00:39:34.178
- As people age...
- I see what you mean.

00:39:34.508 --> 00:39:36.078
As people become older,

00:39:36.178 --> 00:39:38.178
they calculate more.

00:39:38.818 --> 00:39:42.218
Also, with a younger man, it can be more emotional...

00:39:45.588 --> 00:39:48.928
I mean, you can have a more passionate relationship.

00:39:50.428 --> 00:39:51.458
He's right about that.

00:39:51.728 --> 00:39:53.058
- What else?
- What else?

00:39:54.098 --> 00:39:55.898
Being young is good.

00:39:56.198 --> 00:39:57.298
What's good about it?

00:39:57.668 --> 00:39:59.168
- Everything.
- It's good overall?

00:40:00.938 --> 00:40:03.638
There are many good things about becoming older.

00:40:04.678 --> 00:40:06.077
I'll tell you later.

00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:07.078
Later?

00:40:11.418 --> 00:40:14.017
Nine days is a very short time.

00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:15.117
(They have limited time to spend together.)

00:40:15.118 --> 00:40:16.718
In only nine days,

00:40:17.588 --> 00:40:19.158
do you think it's possible...

00:40:20.988 --> 00:40:22.588
to find true love?

00:40:26.198 --> 00:40:28.828
I used to think it wasn't possible.

00:40:30.398 --> 00:40:32.638
I may not fall in love,

00:40:34.668 --> 00:40:37.207
but I think I could be sure about the relationship.

00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:38.538
I could develop feelings.

00:40:41.878 --> 00:40:42.878
(Within the short time given to us...)

00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:44.377
- This is so...
- It's like a youth drama.

00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.818
- This is so fun to watch.
- Indeed.

00:40:46.348 --> 00:40:48.988
(At the same time, at Yeon House...)

00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:51.857
(Sang Won is waiting for Ye Eun.)

00:40:51.858 --> 00:40:55.058
(Nervous)

00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:58.357
(The older women sent Love QR Code last night.)

00:40:58.358 --> 00:41:01.668
(Sang Won got no vote.)

00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:05.737
Looking at it with my own eyes, I was shocked.

00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:07.337
Right. He must have been shocked.

00:41:07.338 --> 00:41:10.537
I decided to approach the one I like more carefully and seriously...

00:41:10.538 --> 00:41:11.738
the next day.

00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:16.047
(Sang Won, who got 0 votes, is nervous about his first date.)

00:41:16.048 --> 00:41:17.308
- Shall we get going?
- Okay.

00:41:17.578 --> 00:41:19.577
How will things go between them?

00:41:19.578 --> 00:41:20.978
I'm so curious.

00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:28.058
Go to your left, please.

00:41:28.828 --> 00:41:29.928
To my car.

00:41:30.158 --> 00:41:31.258
Be careful.

00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.768
(Jumping)

00:41:35.998 --> 00:41:36.998
Please get in.

00:41:37.598 --> 00:41:38.838
He seems proactive.

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:50.448
(Sang Won begins their date with thoughtful gestures.)

00:41:52.178 --> 00:41:54.178
Have you been to this area many times?

00:41:54.418 --> 00:41:56.688
- Here... Namyangju.
- Namyangju?

00:41:56.888 --> 00:41:58.047
Around Paldang Dam.

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:00.417
I've come to this area many times to hang out.

00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:02.587
- Really?
- My friends and I booked a place...

00:42:02.588 --> 00:42:03.728
with private pools.

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.727
We used to go on trips together when I was younger.

00:42:06.728 --> 00:42:08.568
When you were most physically fit.

00:42:09.198 --> 00:42:10.367
You'd have more fun if you're physically fit.

00:42:10.368 --> 00:42:12.338
Before my friends got married.

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:15.707
Are many of your friends married?

00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:17.838
Almost all of my friends are married.

00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:20.437
(Almost all of them?)

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.478
He's surprised.

00:42:22.908 --> 00:42:23.977
He can't believe it.

00:42:23.978 --> 00:42:25.177
He seems quite surprised.

00:42:25.178 --> 00:42:26.617
He must be very young.

00:42:26.618 --> 00:42:27.917
- Right. Sang Won seems...
- Right?

00:42:27.918 --> 00:42:29.218
Very surprised.

00:42:30.388 --> 00:42:33.357
Do some of them have children?

00:42:33.358 --> 00:42:34.828
Yes, of course.

00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:37.988
When I ask them to meet me, they invite me to their homes.

00:42:38.128 --> 00:42:39.398
(Chuckling)

00:42:40.598 --> 00:42:42.927
So you go to your friend's house where she is with her baby?

00:42:42.928 --> 00:42:44.028
That's right.

00:42:44.168 --> 00:42:46.048
My friends invite me so I can see their babies.

00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:49.684
Do they ask you to look after their babies?

00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:51.788
They're like, "I'll cook for you. Come to my house."

00:42:53.608 --> 00:42:55.277
Kids like to play with their parents' friends.

00:42:55.278 --> 00:42:56.307
Yes, they do.

00:42:56.308 --> 00:42:58.748
(Marriage and parenting are unfamiliar subjects to Sang Won.)

00:43:01.718 --> 00:43:04.918
It looks like a house in a mountain.

00:43:06.618 --> 00:43:09.088
Here you go. You will begin by sterilizing these.

00:43:09.928 --> 00:43:12.027
- Did you read the recipe?
- Yes, we did.

00:43:12.028 --> 00:43:13.897
You just have to mix it with malt in water...

00:43:13.898 --> 00:43:16.568
and put the mixture in an earthen crock, and it becomes liquor.

00:43:20.168 --> 00:43:21.288
I'll help you put on gloves.

00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:24.467
Sang Won seems like a person who's comfortable to be with...

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:25.707
- The right hand.
- judging by his tone of voice...

00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:26.908
and good manners.

00:43:27.908 --> 00:43:29.748
- Good.
- Good?

00:43:31.078 --> 00:43:32.718
I feel like I'm about to perform surgery.

00:43:33.118 --> 00:43:34.247
Scalpel, please.

00:43:34.248 --> 00:43:35.388
(Chuckling)

00:43:35.588 --> 00:43:36.588
Are you really a doctor?

00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:37.788
(No way)

00:43:38.988 --> 00:43:41.058
- Great.
- Shall I help you?

00:43:43.158 --> 00:43:44.357
(Realistic pose)

00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:47.798
Wait. Are you a surgeon? You were holding your hands up.

00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.837
(They helped each other wear gloves.)

00:43:52.838 --> 00:43:53.868
Good.

00:43:53.938 --> 00:43:56.237
Should we just mix it like this? What does it say?

00:43:56.238 --> 00:43:58.037
(Getting close to Ye Eun)

00:43:58.038 --> 00:43:59.077
That's dangerous.

00:43:59.078 --> 00:44:01.008
- What does it say?
- It was natural.

00:44:02.278 --> 00:44:03.408
It says dissolve it.

00:44:03.678 --> 00:44:04.678
Using our hands?

00:44:05.578 --> 00:44:07.878
- It says dissolve it in water.
- In water?

00:44:08.988 --> 00:44:10.018
But how?

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:11.858
By stirring?

00:44:13.058 --> 00:44:14.288
(What's that?)

00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:15.728
By stirring?

00:44:16.188 --> 00:44:18.158
Right. Trust me on this.

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:19.998
I'll trust you.

00:44:20.328 --> 00:44:21.797
I can see that she finds him so cute.

00:44:21.798 --> 00:44:22.798
(Smiling)

00:44:22.799 --> 00:44:24.598
I'm the only one you can trust now anyway.

00:44:25.638 --> 00:44:28.037
(Chuckling)

00:44:28.038 --> 00:44:29.507
What is she so happy about?

00:44:29.508 --> 00:44:30.508
(He can't understand.)

00:44:31.508 --> 00:44:32.537
Shall we begin?

00:44:32.538 --> 00:44:34.384
(Just looking at each other makes them chuckle.)

00:44:34.408 --> 00:44:36.578
So this will become makgeolli?

00:44:38.678 --> 00:44:40.748
- Ma'am.
- This is hard rice.

00:44:41.888 --> 00:44:42.948
It smells delicious.

00:44:43.188 --> 00:44:45.288
I have a feeling that it's undercooked.

00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:48.157
Do you remember how to check the rice...

00:44:48.158 --> 00:44:50.788
when you're not sure if it's cooked properly?

00:44:52.058 --> 00:44:53.097
You should taste it.

00:44:53.098 --> 00:44:54.558
That's correct. You can taste some.

00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:55.968
I got it right.

00:44:56.028 --> 00:44:58.028
(Both chuckle.)

00:44:58.198 --> 00:44:59.668
That was witty.

00:45:00.268 --> 00:45:02.437
- Ye Eun is very cute.
- Indeed.

00:45:02.438 --> 00:45:04.507
- They both laugh easily.
- She's cute.

00:45:04.508 --> 00:45:06.177
- She's lovely.
- Yes.

00:45:06.178 --> 00:45:08.177
(Proud of himself)

00:45:08.178 --> 00:45:09.348
Scoop some nicely.

00:45:09.648 --> 00:45:11.277
Are we supposed to eat it with our hands?

00:45:11.278 --> 00:45:13.277
(Laughing)

00:45:13.278 --> 00:45:14.478
Shall I feed you with my hand?

00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:16.147
Do you mind? Would that be okay with you?

00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:17.348
Shall I feed you with my hand?

00:45:17.488 --> 00:45:18.787
(Shy)

00:45:18.788 --> 00:45:20.064
She finds everything he does interesting.

00:45:20.088 --> 00:45:22.057
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:45:22.058 --> 00:45:23.687
(Fortunately, the instructor brought them chopsticks.)

00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:24.728
Shall we taste it?

00:45:25.928 --> 00:45:27.697
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:45:27.698 --> 00:45:28.778
(They clink with the rice.)

00:45:36.538 --> 00:45:37.767
(Exclaiming)

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:40.237
(Chuckling)

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.778
(Exclaiming together)

00:45:42.878 --> 00:45:44.608
Nice. It's delicious.

00:45:45.118 --> 00:45:46.118
Is it because I'm hungry?

00:45:46.748 --> 00:45:49.348
Am I the only one who thinks it's tasty? It's good.

00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:53.687
Cool the rice down with your own method.

00:45:53.688 --> 00:45:54.894
(Sang Won will cool down the rice.)

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:56.087
(Glancing)

00:45:56.088 --> 00:45:57.158
You're good at this.

00:45:57.428 --> 00:45:59.558
(Chuckling)

00:46:00.298 --> 00:46:01.298
Are you a good cook?

00:46:01.798 --> 00:46:03.267
I don't cook.

00:46:03.268 --> 00:46:04.268
You don't cook at all?

00:46:04.398 --> 00:46:05.398
I've never cooked before.

00:46:05.698 --> 00:46:07.437
- What are you going to do then?
- I don't really have to.

00:46:07.438 --> 00:46:09.238
What will you do when it's your turn to cook?

00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:11.637
- I'll do what I can...
- To prepare a meal?

00:46:11.638 --> 00:46:13.438
Yes, I'll do what I can, but...

00:46:13.738 --> 00:46:14.778
(Looking at him nervously)

00:46:14.908 --> 00:46:16.577
- But the taste...
- You can't guarantee the taste?

00:46:16.578 --> 00:46:19.848
That's right. I'll follow a recipe, but...

00:46:20.218 --> 00:46:21.894
- You won't be sure if it's good?
- That's right.

00:46:21.918 --> 00:46:23.287
(Nodding)

00:46:23.288 --> 00:46:24.488
I'll strongly suggest...

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:27.088
that we shouldn't let you cook.

00:46:27.788 --> 00:46:29.358
Because we won't get to eat food.

00:46:29.658 --> 00:46:30.927
Hey, that's mean.

00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:32.128
We all will have to starve.

00:46:33.058 --> 00:46:35.767
I may have never cooked before, but I think I have the talent.

00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:37.648
I cooled it down well. Do you want to touch it?

00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:41.274
Oh, you're right. There's a big difference.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.307
(Happy)

00:46:43.308 --> 00:46:45.137
- But you...
- Do you think I can be a good cook?

00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:47.737
You should focus on our conversation instead of this.

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.298
You're focused on this so much and working hard to cool it down.

00:46:51.148 --> 00:46:54.378
- Why are you trying so hard?
- Haven't I been actively talking?

00:46:54.948 --> 00:46:57.518
(Getting close to Sang Won)

00:46:58.888 --> 00:46:59.888
He's taken aback.

00:46:59.889 --> 00:47:02.157
(Taken aback)

00:47:02.158 --> 00:47:04.164
- I think you were focused on this.
- I don't think so.

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.627
Did we make a bet?

00:47:06.628 --> 00:47:08.497
- He's malfunctioning.
- I think I just didn't notice it.

00:47:08.498 --> 00:47:10.528
Why won't mine cool down? Why is it still so warm?

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.368
I wish we had made a bet.

00:47:12.668 --> 00:47:13.668
What a shame.

00:47:16.008 --> 00:47:18.168
(Chuckling)

00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:20.577
I'm done.

00:47:20.578 --> 00:47:22.098
(Their own makgeolli is done already.)

00:47:22.148 --> 00:47:24.808
(It feels like they've become closer.)

00:47:25.278 --> 00:47:26.777
We misjudged Sang Won.

00:47:26.778 --> 00:47:27.778
- Right.
- We did.

00:47:27.779 --> 00:47:31.448
Now I see why his keyword was "the day flies by."

00:47:31.918 --> 00:47:33.657
He seems to be relaxed now, right?

00:47:33.658 --> 00:47:35.327
Right. I think he was nervous on the first day.

00:47:35.328 --> 00:47:36.587
Things went well between them.

00:47:36.588 --> 00:47:41.158
So I'm pretty sure that Sang Won will ignite the fire.

00:47:41.598 --> 00:47:44.267
- He'll be more active.
- More active than he is now?

00:47:44.268 --> 00:47:47.168
- He was shocked on the first day.
- He'll approach her actively.

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:48.638
How do you think about this?

00:47:48.738 --> 00:47:50.937
As she whined cutely,

00:47:50.938 --> 00:47:53.414
she playfully bumped her shoulder into him. What do you think of it?

00:47:53.438 --> 00:47:58.348
I think Ye Eun doesn't mind light physical touch at all.

00:47:58.718 --> 00:48:00.878
To be honest, if a woman does that to me,

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:05.048
I would probably get the wrong idea.

00:48:05.358 --> 00:48:06.358
Wouldn't you, Woo Young?

00:48:06.888 --> 00:48:08.217
- First of all...
- Am I the only one...

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.334
How would you feel when a woman touches you casually?

00:48:10.358 --> 00:48:13.857
I would be happy. I'd definitely be happy. However...

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:18.068
I'm sure that Ye Eun was interested in Sang Hyeon.

00:48:18.168 --> 00:48:19.997
- Today...
- It's possible...

00:48:19.998 --> 00:48:23.137
that she became interested Sang Won as well.

00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:24.138
Do you think that could be the case?

00:48:24.139 --> 00:48:25.637
I think she became interested in him while dating him.

00:48:25.638 --> 00:48:28.977
Right. I think that's why she made physical contact.

00:48:28.978 --> 00:48:30.277
(Did Ye Eun make physical contact to show her interest in him?)

00:48:30.278 --> 00:48:31.878
She might have become interested in him.

00:48:33.378 --> 00:48:35.147
We're finally going to a cafe together.

00:48:35.148 --> 00:48:36.564
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong's first date)

00:48:36.588 --> 00:48:39.118
We had little time to spend together yesterday.

00:48:39.358 --> 00:48:40.617
- That's true.
- Yes.

00:48:40.618 --> 00:48:43.058
As soon as we met, it started raining.

00:48:43.528 --> 00:48:44.628
That's why I asked you out.

00:48:45.058 --> 00:48:47.197
(They got stuck in the rain on the first day they met.)

00:48:47.198 --> 00:48:48.397
They spent so little time together.

00:48:48.398 --> 00:48:49.398
(Flustered)

00:48:49.598 --> 00:48:53.367
But I think it will remain in my memory for a long time.

00:48:53.368 --> 00:48:55.068
It rained so heavily.

00:48:56.268 --> 00:48:57.708
It reminded me of something.

00:48:58.208 --> 00:49:01.278
Have you watched the movie "The Classic?"

00:49:01.778 --> 00:49:02.778
"The Classic?"

00:49:03.778 --> 00:49:05.877
Is it the right title? Son Ye Jin stars in it.

00:49:05.878 --> 00:49:08.277
Oh, that one? I haven't watched it.

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.318
(Surprised)

00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:12.157
(Deep sigh)

00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:13.287
Hold on a second.

00:49:13.288 --> 00:49:15.094
- He's never watched it.
- He hasn't even watched it.

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.857
She gasped.

00:49:16.858 --> 00:49:18.997
Hold on. This is... Oh, boy.

00:49:18.998 --> 00:49:20.398
This is what older women do.

00:49:20.698 --> 00:49:24.128
When a woman says the first encounter with a man...

00:49:24.368 --> 00:49:26.038
reminded her of "The Classic,"

00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:30.768
she expects the man to be touched by how she feels about it...

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.278
and to become much more fond of her.

00:49:33.578 --> 00:49:34.854
- I see.
- I mean, the best thing...

00:49:34.878 --> 00:49:36.208
Hold on. SOOBIN.

00:49:36.408 --> 00:49:38.448
- SOOBIN doesn't know the movie.
- What's going on?

00:49:38.648 --> 00:49:39.877
- What was that reaction?
- SOOBIN mustn't know the movie.

00:49:39.878 --> 00:49:41.677
- SOOBIN, don't you know the movie?
- Our eyes met.

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.717
And his eyes were shaking.

00:49:43.718 --> 00:49:44.718
(I saw it. SOOBIN's eyes were shaking.)

00:49:44.719 --> 00:49:46.457
What was that reaction, SOOBIN? Please explain.

00:49:46.458 --> 00:49:48.588
When she mentioned "The Classic,"

00:49:49.688 --> 00:49:51.587
- You thought of classic movies?
- I thought she meant music.

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:54.257
- To be honest, I've never heard...
- No way. That can't be.

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:55.297
Of the movie "The Classic."

00:49:55.298 --> 00:49:57.228
Right. I didn't think he knew the movie.

00:49:58.168 --> 00:50:00.614
(When everyone else was talking as "The Classic" was mentioned...)

00:50:00.638 --> 00:50:03.008
(Trying to read their faces)

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:05.538
(I should laugh for now.)

00:50:06.008 --> 00:50:07.238
Is it a Korean movie?

00:50:09.308 --> 00:50:10.647
- Not knowing the movie...
- That hurts my feelings.

00:50:10.648 --> 00:50:12.424
Is more shocking than not knowing Buddy Buddy.

00:50:12.448 --> 00:50:13.648
It really hurts my feelings.

00:50:13.848 --> 00:50:14.848
"The Classic?"

00:50:15.848 --> 00:50:18.087
Is it the right title? Son Ye Jin stars in it.

00:50:18.088 --> 00:50:19.217
Oh, that one? I haven't watched it.

00:50:19.218 --> 00:50:20.558
- You haven't?
- No.

00:50:20.858 --> 00:50:21.887
I haven't watched it.

00:50:21.888 --> 00:50:23.587
(Surprised)

00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:26.898
This is bad. What should he do?

00:50:26.998 --> 00:50:28.427
My gosh. What should he do?

00:50:28.428 --> 00:50:31.767
Is there a scene with a similar atmosphere?

00:50:31.768 --> 00:50:32.997
He's tiptoeing around her. I feel bad for him.

00:50:32.998 --> 00:50:35.667
There's this scene where it starts raining suddenly.

00:50:35.668 --> 00:50:38.338
Oh, I see. I guess it rained that heavily yesterday.

00:50:38.908 --> 00:50:39.938
He has no idea.

00:50:40.908 --> 00:50:44.777
It made me worry if he was too much younger...

00:50:44.778 --> 00:50:46.248
than me.

00:50:47.018 --> 00:50:49.047
But I found him cute.

00:50:49.048 --> 00:50:51.548
Right. He must've seemed so cute.

00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:54.448
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun's dating place: Terrarium cafe)

00:50:56.988 --> 00:50:58.458
Are we going to make something?

00:50:58.798 --> 00:50:59.828
Please sit here.

00:51:00.998 --> 00:51:01.998
- "Terrarium?" - "Terrarium?"

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:05.537
You make your own mini ecosystem in a container.

00:51:05.538 --> 00:51:07.398
(Making a terrarium)

00:51:07.698 --> 00:51:10.708
These stones look expensive.

00:51:12.238 --> 00:51:14.408
(Yeong Gyeong spotted luxurious stones.)

00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:16.548
It has the color of jade.

00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:18.348
Do you like jade?

00:51:19.178 --> 00:51:22.548
The Chinese character "yeong" from my name "Yeong Gyeong..."

00:51:23.048 --> 00:51:26.558
- can also be pronounced as "ok." - Yes.

00:51:27.458 --> 00:51:28.488
Ok Gyeong?

00:51:29.358 --> 00:51:34.228
Yes. So when I show my name in Chinese characters to elders,

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:36.968
- they call me Ok Gyeong.
- I see.

00:51:37.998 --> 00:51:39.438
That's why I like jade.

00:51:42.638 --> 00:51:45.007
Also, my birthstone is emerald.

00:51:45.008 --> 00:51:46.108
Oh, really?

00:51:47.808 --> 00:51:49.908
(Pouring)

00:51:52.278 --> 00:51:54.278
- I'll put these here.
- What?

00:51:55.018 --> 00:51:58.758
Are you picking out the green stones for me?

00:52:00.388 --> 00:52:02.887
He took action as soon as he heard what she said.

00:52:02.888 --> 00:52:06.328
He's so romantic. He really is crunchy outside, tender inside.

00:52:07.158 --> 00:52:08.398
He's very thoughtful.

00:52:09.228 --> 00:52:12.238
(The emerald green stones he picked out for Yeong Gyeong)

00:52:12.738 --> 00:52:16.768
I will put these stones together on one side...

00:52:16.908 --> 00:52:18.737
to cherish them.

00:52:18.738 --> 00:52:21.078
You'll use only the stones in that color?

00:52:21.778 --> 00:52:25.348
The emerald green stones that Hyeon Jun picked out for me.

00:52:26.678 --> 00:52:27.718
That's so sweet.

00:52:29.088 --> 00:52:32.158
(The two of them are falling for each other gradually.)

00:52:32.388 --> 00:52:37.458
(After making their own terrariums...)

00:52:37.858 --> 00:52:40.457
It's really nice. And I think we came here at perfect timing.

00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:43.898
It's about time for sunset.

00:52:49.438 --> 00:52:51.467
Sujebi will be added to the stew.

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:55.478
Since you eat outside, you put sujebi in it by yourselves.

00:52:55.578 --> 00:52:57.077
Divide the dough evenly.

00:52:57.078 --> 00:52:58.977
- Isn't this your first time?
- Yes, it is.

00:52:58.978 --> 00:52:59.978
That's the point.

00:53:02.188 --> 00:53:03.588
It's a sujebi contest.

00:53:04.148 --> 00:53:05.148
I'm good at this.

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.688
- Oh, my. Have you done this before?
- Yes.

00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:11.188
He said we should start right away.

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.298
Right away?

00:53:13.498 --> 00:53:16.198
I made a donut. A sujebi donut.

00:53:17.068 --> 00:53:18.128
That's cute.

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:19.598
Oh, my.

00:53:24.308 --> 00:53:25.408
What's that?

00:53:26.338 --> 00:53:28.707
Is that a twisted donut sujebi?

00:53:28.708 --> 00:53:29.878
I made a twisted donut.

00:53:30.748 --> 00:53:31.748
They're cute.

00:53:33.248 --> 00:53:34.248
Goodbye.

00:53:35.048 --> 00:53:37.948
Oh, my. The sujebi is swelling like bread dough in the oven.

00:53:38.388 --> 00:53:40.688
This looks good. I'm starving.

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:42.658
Look at it.

00:53:43.358 --> 00:53:45.228
The broth got thicker.

00:53:45.758 --> 00:53:47.628
It's like we're camping.

00:53:48.098 --> 00:53:49.268
Do you like going camping?

00:53:50.098 --> 00:53:51.798
I go camping about once a year.

00:53:53.138 --> 00:53:54.998
Isn't once a year very often?

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:56.468
Is it?

00:53:56.968 --> 00:53:58.507
I do it once in about every four years or so.

00:53:58.508 --> 00:53:59.907
- It's hot. Be careful.
- Thank you. Is it?

00:53:59.908 --> 00:54:01.607
(He places the hot bowl in front of Yeong Gyeong.)

00:54:01.608 --> 00:54:03.448
(He's very sweet.)

00:54:03.578 --> 00:54:05.178
- Let's tuck in.
- Let's tuck in.

00:54:05.448 --> 00:54:07.148
Thank you for this.

00:54:07.518 --> 00:54:08.718
Thank you too.

00:54:09.618 --> 00:54:11.318
The catfish is huge.

00:54:12.688 --> 00:54:14.687
Let me debone it.

00:54:14.688 --> 00:54:15.758
(Flipping)

00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:17.388
Are you good at deboning fish?

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:19.698
Are you bad at it?

00:54:25.498 --> 00:54:27.167
I got a big piece. Do you want this?

00:54:27.168 --> 00:54:29.367
(I got a big piece. Do you want this?)

00:54:29.368 --> 00:54:31.238
This guy is too sweet.

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.908
- You should eat it.
- Eat this.

00:54:33.038 --> 00:54:34.277
(Yeong Gyeong is poor at deboning, so he does it for her.)

00:54:34.278 --> 00:54:36.007
Hyeon Jun doesn't make a big deal of it either.

00:54:36.008 --> 00:54:38.147
He casually gives it to her and says, "Take this."

00:54:38.148 --> 00:54:39.278
I will debone it.

00:54:39.718 --> 00:54:41.318
- Thank you.
- I will debone it.

00:54:41.448 --> 00:54:43.048
- I will enjoy it.
- Please do.

00:54:43.488 --> 00:54:45.148
- You did such a neat job.
- Enjoy.

00:54:45.518 --> 00:54:46.717
I did it in one go.

00:54:46.718 --> 00:54:48.888
Men like it when women do that.

00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:51.087
Women are the same.

00:54:51.088 --> 00:54:52.088
Right.

00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:54.009
(She tries the catfish meat Hyeon Jun gave her.)

00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:56.468
(Yum!)

00:54:57.468 --> 00:54:59.298
- It's good.
- It's good.

00:55:00.968 --> 00:55:02.738
Do you cook?

00:55:03.238 --> 00:55:04.537
- Do I cook?
- Yes.

00:55:04.538 --> 00:55:05.778
I like cooking.

00:55:08.478 --> 00:55:12.448
Is there anything you wanted to do here?

00:55:12.978 --> 00:55:15.988
I wanted to cook for the person...

00:55:17.448 --> 00:55:19.818
I'm interested in and eat with her.

00:55:20.458 --> 00:55:22.287
You wanted to cook and eat with her?

00:55:22.288 --> 00:55:24.328
(Hyeon Jun wanted to cook with the woman he likes.)

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:25.658
How about you, Ok Gyeong?

00:55:26.728 --> 00:55:28.158
Only he gets to call her that.

00:55:29.098 --> 00:55:30.527
Teasing her like that is nice.

00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:32.698
- It will lighten the mood.
- Right.

00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:36.338
I guess I wanted to go on a date like this.

00:55:37.438 --> 00:55:38.568
I guess...

00:55:39.278 --> 00:55:40.807
a cooking date is next.

00:55:40.808 --> 00:55:41.838
Right.

00:55:42.978 --> 00:55:45.148
It's really pretty behind you.

00:55:45.248 --> 00:55:46.648
It's really pretty.

00:55:49.388 --> 00:55:51.948
- It's a pink sunset.
- The view is magnificent.

00:55:54.358 --> 00:55:56.257
(Looking at the pink sunset, )

00:55:56.258 --> 00:55:58.257
(they get lost in emotion.)

00:55:58.258 --> 00:56:00.358
What a great view for a fish stew restaurant.

00:56:01.628 --> 00:56:03.868
I love looking at the sunset.

00:56:05.638 --> 00:56:09.708
They get along so naturally.

00:56:11.838 --> 00:56:13.307
- Don't tell me you're done.
- Pardon?

00:56:13.308 --> 00:56:15.608
- Don't tell me you're done.
- I have a grand plan.

00:56:15.748 --> 00:56:17.848
- What is it?
- I'll ask if there's fried rice.

00:56:18.878 --> 00:56:20.558
I will go and cook the fried rice for you.

00:56:20.918 --> 00:56:22.548
- Will you really?
- Another fried rice.

00:56:23.588 --> 00:56:25.218
- Shall we go?
- Sounds great.

00:56:27.558 --> 00:56:29.657
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

00:56:29.658 --> 00:56:31.157
(How will this date change the two?)

00:56:31.158 --> 00:56:34.598
That restaurant must have had fried rice in the menu.

00:56:34.928 --> 00:56:36.927
- They could've had it there.
- Right.

00:56:36.928 --> 00:56:38.397
- But he insisted.
- To cook it for her.

00:56:38.398 --> 00:56:40.498
When he said he would go cook it for her,

00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:42.167
she would've figured out that he is trying to win her over.

00:56:42.168 --> 00:56:44.207
She must've found him cute.

00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:45.237
- He saw through Hyeon Jun.
- You think so?

00:56:45.238 --> 00:56:49.478
There are eight of them.

00:56:49.578 --> 00:56:51.507
The fact that he's willing to make fried rice for her...

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.448
in front of everyone...

00:56:54.278 --> 00:56:55.687
- You would hate that?
- I would love that.

00:56:55.688 --> 00:56:57.164
- You would love that? That too?
- I...

00:56:57.188 --> 00:56:58.617
- How can you not love it?
- I would hate that.

00:56:58.618 --> 00:57:00.387
- I thought you would hate it.
- Isn't it super sweet?

00:57:00.388 --> 00:57:01.917
- Really?
- It's like declaring...

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:04.057
that she's mine in front of everyone.

00:57:04.058 --> 00:57:05.858
(Is it like declaring that she's his?)

00:57:06.458 --> 00:57:07.597
(It's the date spot Sang Hyeon picked.)

00:57:07.598 --> 00:57:09.028
It must be here.

00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:13.338
Dogs! They are huge.

00:57:13.738 --> 00:57:14.968
- Cute.
- Can you pat them?

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.638
Hello.

00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:18.208
They are adorable.

00:57:21.408 --> 00:57:23.247
There's a stream in front of it too.

00:57:23.248 --> 00:57:25.078
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Won's first date)

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.618
This is so lovely.

00:57:27.418 --> 00:57:29.098
I think the food is going to be delicious.

00:57:29.518 --> 00:57:31.387
(Looking away)

00:57:31.388 --> 00:57:32.757
(Sang Hyeon can't even lock eyes with her...)

00:57:32.758 --> 00:57:35.888
(now that they are sitting across each other.)

00:57:36.888 --> 00:57:37.888
(Staring)

00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:41.098
(But Ji Won stares right into his eyes.)

00:57:42.928 --> 00:57:45.568
He's shy. Goodness.

00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:49.038
Golden Retriever.

00:57:50.638 --> 00:57:53.278
I'm so embarrassed.

00:57:54.278 --> 00:57:58.548
You're a Golden Retriever, so I thought you'd be just cute.

00:57:59.348 --> 00:58:02.448
But hearing you talk...

00:58:02.888 --> 00:58:04.348
and talking to you,

00:58:05.218 --> 00:58:08.858
I realized you are not just a cute person.

00:58:09.288 --> 00:58:10.657
You are super calm.

00:58:10.658 --> 00:58:12.258
That makes me too boring.

00:58:12.558 --> 00:58:13.928
You are not too boring.

00:58:16.168 --> 00:58:17.798
(Embarrassed)

00:58:18.168 --> 00:58:19.238
(Dropping his head)

00:58:22.238 --> 00:58:23.938
(Embarrassed)

00:58:26.508 --> 00:58:27.838
Sang Hyeon,

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.708
why did you...

00:58:31.308 --> 00:58:32.718
ask me out on a date today?

00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:35.748
Well...

00:58:38.218 --> 00:58:39.557
It's still too early to say anything,

00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:42.558
but when it came to the spark...

00:58:44.128 --> 00:58:46.398
and some other reason for wanting to get closer...

00:58:46.798 --> 00:58:48.457
Whatever reason it was,

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:51.598
it was you I wanted to talk to.

00:58:53.098 --> 00:58:54.567
(On the first day of Yeon House, )

00:58:54.568 --> 00:58:56.368
(Ji Won and Sang Hyeon did dishes together.)

00:58:56.568 --> 00:58:59.038
Have you dated an older woman?

00:58:59.538 --> 00:59:01.178
I've never dated one seriously.

00:59:01.408 --> 00:59:02.438
Is that right?

00:59:03.408 --> 00:59:05.208
Is there a specific type you like?

00:59:05.578 --> 00:59:07.147
I like a teto-guy.

00:59:07.148 --> 00:59:08.378
- A teto-guy.
- Yes.

00:59:08.618 --> 00:59:10.517
That's a surprise.

00:59:10.518 --> 00:59:13.017
I thought you would like to lead the relationship.

00:59:13.018 --> 00:59:14.157
- Lead?
- Yes.

00:59:14.158 --> 00:59:15.418
I lead one well too.

00:59:16.058 --> 00:59:17.527
(Ji Won made Sang Hyeon feel comfortable.)

00:59:17.528 --> 00:59:19.958
That's where he got the first impression.

00:59:21.258 --> 00:59:22.398
I'm glad to hear it.

00:59:24.768 --> 00:59:26.438
This makes me...

00:59:27.068 --> 00:59:29.638
a little more serious.

00:59:31.438 --> 00:59:35.407
If I fall for someone's looks only...

00:59:35.408 --> 00:59:37.708
and approach her aggressively,

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:42.247
that might hurt her feelings.

00:59:42.248 --> 00:59:45.888
That's why I'm more cautious.

00:59:49.928 --> 00:59:52.488
That's why I took it slow today.

00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:55.297
Even if I liked someone,

00:59:55.298 --> 00:59:58.067
I didn't want to express my feelings right away.

00:59:58.068 --> 00:59:59.998
If I told her that I liked her now,

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:04.308
that wouldn't be sincere.

01:00:04.508 --> 01:00:06.637
That's more of a momentary attraction.

01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:08.838
(That's just attraction. That's not a sincere feeling.)

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:12.107
He's sensitive.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.017
(This man is sensitive.)

01:00:14.018 --> 01:00:17.588
Sang Hyeon is a serious and thoughtful man.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:19.657
He's the man who wants...

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.627
to take responsibility for his words.

01:00:22.628 --> 01:00:25.058
Not all younger men are the same.

01:00:25.358 --> 01:00:26.658
They are all different.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:29.968
I want to date someone who sees that side of me.

01:00:30.368 --> 01:00:31.798
- Who sees that side of you?
- Yes.

01:00:32.498 --> 01:00:34.867
I'm not someone...

01:00:34.868 --> 01:00:37.008
who is always cheerful.

01:00:37.538 --> 01:00:40.738
But just because I look cheerful,

01:00:41.278 --> 01:00:43.278
people see me as a bubbly person.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.248
But I am a very serious type.

01:00:46.878 --> 01:00:49.688
I'm a not-so-boomer boomer.

01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:54.988
So I want someone who can see even that side of me.

01:00:55.888 --> 01:00:56.958
Yes.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.558
You look serious.

01:01:03.168 --> 01:01:04.227
I do?

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:05.498
(She's touched.)

01:01:06.068 --> 01:01:08.538
You and I can have a conversation.

01:01:10.408 --> 01:01:11.607
(They got closer through the date.)

01:01:11.608 --> 01:01:12.738
My goodness.

01:01:12.978 --> 01:01:14.438
Sang Hyeon is so charming.

01:01:15.178 --> 01:01:17.078
Thank you.

01:01:17.448 --> 01:01:18.708
Can you pass me your plate?

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.217
- This one?
- Yes.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:22.047
(Sang Hyeon naturally serves Ji Won first.)

01:01:22.048 --> 01:01:24.047
- The meat is...
- Are you giving me the biggest one?

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.118
- Of course.
- Goodness.

01:01:25.488 --> 01:01:27.458
- Thank you, Sang Hyeon.
- You're welcome.

01:01:28.258 --> 01:01:30.228
Thanks to you, I got to come here.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.768
I wouldn't come to a place like this alone, would I?

01:01:33.598 --> 01:01:34.798
I'm grateful to you.

01:01:36.098 --> 01:01:38.168
What's common...

01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:41.398
about the people you've dated?

01:01:45.408 --> 01:01:46.768
- What's common about them?
- Yes.

01:01:48.678 --> 01:01:51.078
I like someone who speaks nicely.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.818
(Thinking hard)

01:01:55.118 --> 01:01:57.018
Did I speak nicely today?

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.257
You did speak nicely.

01:02:02.258 --> 01:02:03.288
(Shy)

01:02:06.258 --> 01:02:07.428
Sang Hyeon.

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.267
When you get back today,

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.328
Yes?

01:02:13.268 --> 01:02:16.938
Who else do you want to talk to?

01:02:18.308 --> 01:02:20.738
(Thinking carefully)

01:02:21.015 --> 01:02:22.245
Sang Hyeon.

01:02:23.145 --> 01:02:24.984
When you get back today,

01:02:24.985 --> 01:02:26.055
Yes?

01:02:27.985 --> 01:02:31.555
Who else do you want to talk to?

01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:35.495
(Thinking carefully)

01:02:38.395 --> 01:02:39.435
Bon Hee.

01:02:40.135 --> 01:02:41.534
- Bon Hee.
- No way.

01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:43.005
See? I told you.

01:02:43.065 --> 01:02:46.635
(I see.)

01:02:46.835 --> 01:02:49.004
There's still time.

01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:50.645
- It's only the second day.
- Yes.

01:02:51.145 --> 01:02:54.774
You need to talk to several people.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:56.745
(It looks like Sang Hyeon has a lot on his mind.)

01:02:57.585 --> 01:03:01.415
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Won had an honest conversation.)

01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:03.055
(Mu Jin's second spot is a pork belly barbecue place.)

01:03:03.056 --> 01:03:05.355
- You want a soju-beer cocktail?
- Yes.

01:03:05.895 --> 01:03:08.455
I haven't had this cocktail in so long.

01:03:09.525 --> 01:03:10.795
I will mix up a good one.

01:03:12.495 --> 01:03:13.834
You don't use a shot glass for measurement?

01:03:13.835 --> 01:03:14.935
I don't need it.

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:17.304
No mixing performance?

01:03:17.305 --> 01:03:19.145
- No. This is how I mix.
- That's how you mix.

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:22.144
Shall we have a drink?

01:03:22.145 --> 01:03:24.044
It's going to hit hard if we have this on an empty stomach.

01:03:24.045 --> 01:03:25.174
Would you have it?

01:03:25.175 --> 01:03:26.415
- I want to drink it.
- You do?

01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:28.374
But you said you had an upset stomach.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:30.384
It might get worse if you drink it on an empty stomach.

01:03:30.385 --> 01:03:31.644
She's worrying about him again.

01:03:31.645 --> 01:03:34.185
- Me?
- Yes. I'm the same. Us.

01:03:35.155 --> 01:03:36.655
- I will drink it later then.
- Okay.

01:03:39.725 --> 01:03:43.125
(Meanwhile, the table is set.)

01:03:44.025 --> 01:03:45.764
That's the meat, isn't it?

01:03:45.765 --> 01:03:46.794
It is.

01:03:46.795 --> 01:03:48.075
Are you going to grill the meat?

01:03:48.905 --> 01:03:50.435
I will try grilling it.

01:03:51.405 --> 01:03:52.435
I'd love that.

01:03:53.635 --> 01:03:54.974
It's just a barbecue.

01:03:54.975 --> 01:03:56.275
(Excited)

01:03:57.005 --> 01:03:59.474
It's the first to get the meat in a plastic bag.

01:03:59.475 --> 01:04:02.015
I know. I've never gotten the meat in a bag.

01:04:03.585 --> 01:04:05.385
Let's grill the kimchi too.

01:04:05.955 --> 01:04:07.385
I didn't think about kimchi.

01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:10.285
I was really craving pork belly.

01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:12.855
(Proud)

01:04:13.495 --> 01:04:14.695
What kind of meat do you like?

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:16.941
I like pork belly barbecue with kimchi.

01:04:16.965 --> 01:04:18.605
- Pork belly barbecue with kimchi.
- Yes.

01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:20.464
I like pork belly barbecue with kimchi too.

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:21.734
(Mu Jin remembered what Bon Hee likes to eat.)

01:04:21.735 --> 01:04:24.505
She said she likes pork belly barbecue with kimchi.

01:04:24.635 --> 01:04:25.675
Bon Hee said that.

01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:27.475
Should I cut up the meat?

01:04:29.305 --> 01:04:30.774
Should I cut it?

01:04:30.775 --> 01:04:33.945
- Only the big pieces like these?
- Only the big pieces?

01:04:34.175 --> 01:04:35.985
I like my meat big.

01:04:37.115 --> 01:04:39.985
(He cuts the meat nicely for Bon Hee.)

01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:42.625
(Looking around)

01:04:42.955 --> 01:04:44.585
What do you need? An apron?

01:04:45.055 --> 01:04:46.225
Yes. An apron.

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:47.855
How did you know?

01:04:48.555 --> 01:04:51.365
When you're in front of someone you like,

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:53.564
you keep checking what that person needs, don't you?

01:04:53.565 --> 01:04:54.695
- Do you do that?
- Yes.

01:04:55.165 --> 01:04:56.405
I guess you don't do that.

01:04:56.665 --> 01:04:59.174
But you need to know that person to do that.

01:04:59.175 --> 01:05:00.874
But when she looks around, you would know.

01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:01.905
I would?

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:06.045
Excuse me. Do you have an apron?

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.945
You are actually thoughtful.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:12.285
Who is?

01:05:12.585 --> 01:05:14.155
I think you are very thoughtful.

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:15.785
I'm thoughtful?

01:05:16.355 --> 01:05:17.425
Did you know?

01:05:18.685 --> 01:05:20.595
I guess I am.

01:05:28.635 --> 01:05:29.705
I'll wear it alone, okay?

01:05:29.805 --> 01:05:31.105
(Nodding)

01:05:38.445 --> 01:05:40.315
- It's ready to eat.
- I think it's ready now.

01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:42.615
Thank you for this.

01:05:43.145 --> 01:05:44.185
It looks so good.

01:05:53.795 --> 01:05:54.824
(They look at each other.)

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:56.064
(Nodding)

01:05:56.065 --> 01:05:57.095
It's good.

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:00.465
Cheers.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.865
- No.
- I will drink slowly.

01:06:07.775 --> 01:06:09.805
Doesn't it taste sweet?

01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:11.605
- Is it sweet?
- Yes.

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:14.645
It's because it's made with the golden ratio.

01:06:16.615 --> 01:06:17.685
That's why it's sweet.

01:06:19.285 --> 01:06:22.015
You actually think you don't have an accent?

01:06:22.225 --> 01:06:24.255
What? When did I speak with an accent?

01:06:28.455 --> 01:06:31.325
When we become more comfortable with each other,

01:06:32.335 --> 01:06:34.465
I think I might speak with a heavier accent.

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:35.935
I had no idea at first.

01:06:37.005 --> 01:06:38.035
At the cafe.

01:06:38.535 --> 01:06:41.174
But as more time passed, you started to speak with an accent.

01:06:41.175 --> 01:06:42.505
At first, I had no idea.

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:47.715
Isn't speaking with an accent sometimes really sexy?

01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:50.984
Am I wrong? And when girls speak with an accent,

01:06:50.985 --> 01:06:52.115
they sound cute, don't they?

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:54.684
(Agreeing)

01:06:54.685 --> 01:06:56.125
What if a man speaks with an accent?

01:06:57.225 --> 01:06:58.945
I think it's a plus when you speak it well.

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:01.654
I've never dated someone who speaks with an accent.

01:07:01.655 --> 01:07:02.995
You've never dated one?

01:07:10.605 --> 01:07:12.405
You saw all the men yesterday.

01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:17.805
Is there anyone you want to know more about?

01:07:23.015 --> 01:07:24.485
Someone I want to know more about?

01:07:27.115 --> 01:07:28.415
(Smiling)

01:07:28.985 --> 01:07:30.154
- Look at him staring at her.
- What a question.

01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:31.554
Did you see him smiling like a little devil?

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:32.925
- Look at him.
- He smiled at her.

01:07:33.455 --> 01:07:35.525
It was the smile that said, "You're mine now."

01:07:37.425 --> 01:07:39.295
(Smiling brightly)

01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:42.765
(What's so funny?)

01:07:43.465 --> 01:07:44.765
You're curious about that?

01:07:46.505 --> 01:07:47.505
I'm just asking.

01:07:51.045 --> 01:07:52.775
- There's no one.
- No one?

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:54.645
No one so far.

01:07:58.685 --> 01:07:59.755
(Peeking at her)

01:08:00.555 --> 01:08:03.155
I received a text message last night.

01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:06.195
You received only one?

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.294
(Hesitating)

01:08:08.295 --> 01:08:09.365
I got two.

01:08:11.165 --> 01:08:12.195
But there was...

01:08:13.035 --> 01:08:17.304
a photo I saw that looked like...

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:18.535
it was sent by you.

01:08:20.575 --> 01:08:21.775
You sent that one, didn't you?

01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:24.145
The color of the sofa.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.075
I think it was green.

01:08:26.445 --> 01:08:27.775
(Agreeing)

01:08:28.275 --> 01:08:30.015
I thought it might be you.

01:08:30.615 --> 01:08:31.845
And it made me happy.

01:08:34.985 --> 01:08:37.355
My facial muscles are getting stiff.

01:08:42.095 --> 01:08:44.024
I didn't tell you this yesterday, but I like deep green.

01:08:44.025 --> 01:08:45.935
It's actually my favorite color.

01:08:46.235 --> 01:08:47.395
Is it really?

01:08:48.365 --> 01:08:49.645
Then we are the same, aren't we?

01:08:50.535 --> 01:08:51.964
You must've been shocked yesterday then.

01:08:51.965 --> 01:08:54.475
I was shocked. It wasn't just green either.

01:08:55.905 --> 01:08:57.145
It was deep green.

01:08:58.345 --> 01:08:59.945
- Did you not say it on purpose?
- No.

01:09:00.945 --> 01:09:04.215
It's because we share a lot of other things in common too.

01:09:04.945 --> 01:09:07.684
When you like someone too much,

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.125
it's hard to express, isn't it?

01:09:11.155 --> 01:09:12.825
(Nodding)

01:09:13.095 --> 01:09:14.855
What's the best dish you can cook?

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:16.625
Fried rice?

01:09:16.965 --> 01:09:19.205
- Kimchi fried rice?
- That I can do. Kimchi fried rice.

01:09:20.295 --> 01:09:22.065
Do you want me to cook it for you later?

01:09:22.195 --> 01:09:24.904
I can eat about two bowls of kimchi fried rice.

01:09:24.905 --> 01:09:26.035
- Two bowls?
- Yes.

01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:28.534
Okay. Two bowls.

01:09:28.535 --> 01:09:29.905
- Fried rice again?
- Fried rice.

01:09:29.945 --> 01:09:32.844
Perhaps two men are going to stand in front of the stove...

01:09:32.845 --> 01:09:33.875
and make fried rice.

01:09:36.615 --> 01:09:42.015
(Sang Won and Ye Eun's second date spot is an izakaya.)

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:47.755
You're not cold?

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:49.465
- I'm still fine.
- You are?

01:09:49.495 --> 01:09:50.695
I'm afraid you might get cold.

01:09:55.035 --> 01:09:56.104
Do you eat this?

01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:57.105
(Shaking her head)

01:09:57.106 --> 01:09:58.135
I'm the same.

01:09:58.765 --> 01:10:01.305
I wondered if you ate it.

01:10:01.475 --> 01:10:02.745
Have you tried it?

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:04.605
I eat it when someone peels it.

01:10:04.705 --> 01:10:06.575
Would you like it? Do you want me to peel it?

01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:08.344
No, you don't have to do it.

01:10:08.345 --> 01:10:10.225
Let's have it together. I will have a bean too.

01:10:11.185 --> 01:10:12.415
- Wait.
- Edamame.

01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:15.055
- How do you do it?
- You can't even peel it.

01:10:15.855 --> 01:10:16.885
Can't I just rip it open?

01:10:18.185 --> 01:10:19.355
(Realizing)

01:10:19.725 --> 01:10:21.095
It pops out like this.

01:10:21.455 --> 01:10:22.464
Do you want me to hand it like this?

01:10:22.465 --> 01:10:23.925
Maybe you will make it fly?

01:10:24.965 --> 01:10:26.764
(He shoots a bean.)

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:28.065
You dropped it everywhere.

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.505
(Her guess was right.)

01:10:30.635 --> 01:10:31.665
I am sorry.

01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:36.905
Why don't we just put it here like how they put wasabi?

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:39.275
Nobody would notice it even if we don't eat it.

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:42.144
- Do you like wasabi?
- I like it.

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:43.545
I love it.

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:44.885
It's...

01:10:44.886 --> 01:10:45.915
Should we ask for a lot?

01:10:46.515 --> 01:10:47.555
A mountain of it, perhaps?

01:10:47.885 --> 01:10:50.585
- A mountain of it, perhaps?
- Only if we need more.

01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:54.255
(Thinking)

01:10:55.865 --> 01:10:59.535
Actually, here's what I'm thinking.

01:11:00.035 --> 01:11:01.695
We met for the first time.

01:11:01.765 --> 01:11:03.134
We are bound to be a little awkward.

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.605
We are strangers after all.

01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:08.275
When do we drop the honorifics?

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:11.405
Or do we keep the honorifics? That's difficult for me.

01:11:13.015 --> 01:11:14.375
That's understandable.

01:11:15.715 --> 01:11:18.685
Are you suggesting that we drop it now?

01:11:20.655 --> 01:11:21.655
Why don't we drop it now?

01:11:22.525 --> 01:11:24.825
(He's very assertive.)

01:11:25.325 --> 01:11:26.354
Why don't we drop it now?

01:11:26.355 --> 01:11:27.395
Shall we?

01:11:27.725 --> 01:11:28.795
Let's do it.

01:11:29.725 --> 01:11:30.765
Drop the honorifics.

01:11:31.465 --> 01:11:33.334
It's a little tough when you drop it suddenly, you know?

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:34.934
It was his idea in the first place.

01:11:34.935 --> 01:11:36.104
And now he's shy.

01:11:36.105 --> 01:11:39.135
He had the manly side.

01:11:39.605 --> 01:11:42.405
That made my heart skip a beat.

01:11:49.185 --> 01:11:50.415
I can't talk now.

01:11:51.185 --> 01:11:53.015
Should we keep it until we feel comfortable?

01:11:53.485 --> 01:11:54.585
I like that too.

01:11:55.055 --> 01:11:57.384
Let's mix.

01:11:57.385 --> 01:11:58.385
We will mix it up.

01:12:00.725 --> 01:12:02.695
- Here's your food.
- Thank you.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:04.694
You said you like wasabi.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:05.934
- Here's your wasabi.
- Thank you.

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:07.394
(Sang Won turns the plate so wasabi goes to Ye Eun.)

01:12:07.395 --> 01:12:09.765
Do we have wasabi at Yeon House?

01:12:10.265 --> 01:12:11.535
- We don't have it.
- We don't?

01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:13.605
But I haven't really checked.

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:16.675
Anyway.

01:12:17.145 --> 01:12:19.315
Wasabi is important.

01:12:21.445 --> 01:12:23.944
(Smiling)

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:25.015
(Happy)

01:12:25.445 --> 01:12:29.154
(Hesitating)

01:12:29.155 --> 01:12:30.185
I'm curious.

01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:34.315
I've been wanting to ask you this, even when we were in the car.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.265
By any chance, were you glad...

01:12:37.225 --> 01:12:41.165
when I asked you on a date? Or...

01:12:41.865 --> 01:12:44.405
You know, I was... How should I say this?

01:12:45.765 --> 01:12:47.504
I didn't think you'd ask me.

01:12:47.505 --> 01:12:49.251
Right. I wanted to ask you about that kind of thing.

01:12:49.275 --> 01:12:50.804
I figured you might not have expected it.

01:12:50.805 --> 01:12:52.945
To be honest, I really didn't expect it.

01:12:53.245 --> 01:12:56.515
For me, I was like, "I'm curious about her."

01:12:57.445 --> 01:12:59.285
"Her personality isn't what I thought it was."

01:12:59.355 --> 01:13:02.014
"I thought she'd be really cold, but she isn't."

01:13:02.015 --> 01:13:03.655
You seemed really cheerful.

01:13:04.285 --> 01:13:06.454
I had that thought while we were eating.

01:13:06.455 --> 01:13:08.695
- While we were eating?
- We sat across from each other.

01:13:08.755 --> 01:13:09.824
(During breakfast, the two sat across from each other.)

01:13:09.825 --> 01:13:11.565
(Sang Won, Ye Eun)

01:13:12.465 --> 01:13:15.905
(Unlike her cold image, Ye Eun's behavior was different.)

01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:20.035
(Finding her cute)

01:13:20.235 --> 01:13:21.304
That was the first time I got a good look at you...

01:13:21.305 --> 01:13:23.975
and realized you have such a small face.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.821
That was the first time I got a really good look at you.

01:13:25.845 --> 01:13:28.325
You can't really get a close look when you're just passing by.

01:13:29.115 --> 01:13:30.115
I was surprised.

01:13:30.116 --> 01:13:31.484
(I was surprised when I saw you from up close.)

01:13:31.485 --> 01:13:32.654
I'm not kidding.

01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:33.655
(Giggling)

01:13:33.656 --> 01:13:36.184
I think it's just a fact that you have a small face.

01:13:36.185 --> 01:13:38.065
(She feels great at the series of compliments.)

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:42.395
How many people do you want to get to know more?

01:13:45.225 --> 01:13:47.165
(Thinking)

01:13:51.065 --> 01:13:52.105
One person?

01:13:53.635 --> 01:13:54.635
One person?

01:13:54.675 --> 01:13:56.774
(Thinking)

01:13:56.775 --> 01:13:58.095
I think there's one other person.

01:13:58.975 --> 01:14:00.215
He's so honest.

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:03.344
But it's better to do that rather than choose someone else later.

01:14:03.345 --> 01:14:04.785
I think just saying it is better.

01:14:04.885 --> 01:14:07.485
No. We already heard the answer earlier.

01:14:08.455 --> 01:14:10.185
(The answer?)

01:14:10.555 --> 01:14:13.455
- You're the only one right now.
- You're the only one right now?

01:14:13.655 --> 01:14:14.655
- Right.
- Right now...

01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:17.764
Not me. I think it's better to say that there's one other person.

01:14:17.765 --> 01:14:20.964
What if he chooses someone else after this?

01:14:20.965 --> 01:14:22.195
I'd be more annoyed.

01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:25.665
You're so honest.

01:14:25.905 --> 01:14:26.905
One person?

01:14:26.906 --> 01:14:29.134
(Thinking)

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:30.455
I think there's one other person.

01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:32.645
The vibe has slightly shifted.

01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:36.185
But I think it's not about getting to know...

01:14:37.985 --> 01:14:39.745
I can't figure that person out, to be exact.

01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:42.454
"What kind of person is she?"

01:14:42.455 --> 01:14:44.454
(He's curious about one other person besides Ye Eun.)

01:14:44.455 --> 01:14:46.535
I think I should have some level of understanding...

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:49.664
to become more strongly attracted.

01:14:49.665 --> 01:14:52.625
And I think I need that stronger attraction to actively move forward.

01:14:53.195 --> 01:14:54.265
You think so?

01:14:54.965 --> 01:14:56.905
- Her energy level has dropped.
- It has.

01:15:00.005 --> 01:15:03.444
Well, I just... Do what you want, Sang Won.

01:15:03.445 --> 01:15:05.175
Don't think too much about it.

01:15:06.915 --> 01:15:09.645
I shouldn't think too much when it comes to emotions.

01:15:13.215 --> 01:15:15.415
I just didn't feel that great.

01:15:17.155 --> 01:15:20.755
I'm not really sure...

01:15:21.195 --> 01:15:25.395
what he's trying to express with his uncertain behavior.

01:15:28.335 --> 01:15:29.764
(The air suddenly seems much heavier.)

01:15:29.765 --> 01:15:31.525
- Oh, no.
- Things suddenly became so heavy.

01:15:32.535 --> 01:15:34.334
- Oh, no.
- Gosh, he was too honest.

01:15:34.335 --> 01:15:36.304
Oh, no. Her face is expressionless.

01:15:36.305 --> 01:15:38.075
See? This is what happens.

01:15:38.405 --> 01:15:40.144
Gosh, I still think it's better to say it, though.

01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:41.274
- Oh, no.
- Let's put...

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.435
the heavy conversation aside.

01:15:42.515 --> 01:15:45.415
- Let's eat.
- Oh, no.

01:15:46.455 --> 01:15:48.015
Gosh, but Ye Eun is so...

01:15:49.885 --> 01:15:51.624
How much wasabi do I put... Should I put it on?

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.305
Oh, I guess I don't have to put that much.

01:15:55.025 --> 01:15:56.225
Don't you dip it in soy sauce?

01:15:56.665 --> 01:15:58.265
- I don't really do that.
- Oh, really?

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:01.765
That's good.

01:16:03.135 --> 01:16:04.534
Oh, no.

01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:05.841
(They go through many emotions on the night of the first date.)

01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:08.174
Gosh, what are we going to do about this vibe?

01:16:08.175 --> 01:16:09.175
(Everyone is at a loss.)

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:10.475
Oh, dear.

01:16:11.675 --> 01:16:13.074
This is really bad.

01:16:13.075 --> 01:16:16.185
Gosh, but Ye Eun... Is it really necessary for her...

01:16:16.345 --> 01:16:20.055
to express how disappointed she is?

01:16:20.485 --> 01:16:25.424
But don't you think that Sang Won would make her feel better?

01:16:25.425 --> 01:16:27.624
I think that will require so much effort...

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.295
- to do so. Yes.
- Lots of effort?

01:16:30.525 --> 01:16:32.464
(After the date, )

01:16:32.465 --> 01:16:34.335
(the mood has become frigid.)

01:16:35.165 --> 01:16:37.035
(I have a headache.)

01:16:37.965 --> 01:16:39.404
(The date...)

01:16:39.405 --> 01:16:41.105
(wasn't enjoyable.)

01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:44.305
(I want to get to know her more.)

01:16:45.475 --> 01:16:50.685
(At Yeon House, the temperature seems subtly different.)

01:16:51.515 --> 01:16:54.784
(And...)

01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:58.455
(a mysterious car arrives at Yeon House.)

01:17:01.455 --> 01:17:04.325
(Will a younger guy appear to change the temperature?)

01:17:05.195 --> 01:17:06.895
(I don't care about age differences.)

01:17:08.595 --> 01:17:11.405
(I think I just need 3 seconds to make a decision.)

01:17:11.605 --> 01:17:13.434
(No way.)

01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:14.535
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:17:15.775 --> 01:17:17.345
(He looked cool.)

01:17:18.245 --> 01:17:20.475
(He had a huge impact.)

01:17:21.215 --> 01:17:24.415
(The mood changes with the appearance of a new younger guy.)

01:17:25.345 --> 01:17:27.815
(The beginning of a change in the game at Yeon House)

01:17:33.655 --> 01:17:36.025
(Could we talk for a bit?)

01:17:36.265 --> 01:17:39.195
(I can't really express everything in my heart.)

01:17:39.865 --> 01:17:42.435
(It does make me jealous.)
