00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.128
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.130
[Jimin] We need to win two games, right?

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.999
-The capital of Malta?
-Morta?

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.066
ONE LOSS

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.268
Minus one.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.403
THEY WENT TO BUY GROCERIES AS A PENALTY

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.905
AND ANOTHER PENALTY

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:38.972
Phones?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.041
FORCED DIGITAL MINIMALISM TIME

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.143
The only thing that makes me happy now

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.012
is using my phone at night.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.647
So annoying.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.048
This is insane.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.050
UNDER A SKY FULL OF BEAUTIFUL STARS

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.052
[Jung Kook] Only those stars
are twinkling.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.787
What's happening? Make a wish.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.188
MAKING WISHES TOGETHER

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.924
We're seeing it here again.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.126
[Jimin] It's really nice.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.329
[Jung Kook] We would've regretted it
if we hadn't come here.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.031
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.566
TO THEIR THIRD DESTINATION

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.067
We can take IC6.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.135

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.971
AND BY FERRY, THEY ARRIVE AT THE VILLAGE

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.173
[Jung Kook] It really looks

[Jung Kook] Gonna be cold.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.248
THE TWO DECIDE TO WALK TO THE HOT TUG SPOT

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.783
We should do this to make

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.385
ourselves more visible.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.954
It gets darker this way.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.392
It's so cute.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.362
[Jung Kook] Looks like it's smiling.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.964
SYNCHRONIZING EXPRESSIONS

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.799
Only it's mouth is smiling.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.500
So cute.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.036
Why is that one so cute?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.371
Whoa, hey.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.406
-What?
-Look at the light coming down.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.541
Wow.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.676
[Jung Kook] Those beams of light
are gorgeous.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.046
The rays breaking through the clouds...

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.915
Natural fog effects.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.150
Ah.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:00.687
Does your arm really hurt?

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.356

-What are you looking at?
-[Jung Kook laughing]

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.464
Why are you staring? You wanna go?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.567
Go ahead then. I'm not afraid.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:22.442

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.667
VERY SATISFIED

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.536
Someone just left this here
without returning it.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.672
Jung Kook will take care of it, then.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.839
So kind, as usual.

That's a long way to come.

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.014
Long way to come?

-Do you have any?
-No.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.120

[in Korean] This is nice.

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:00.467
We're supposed to look this way.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:02.903
-Should we go further?
-Let's go!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.671
LET'S HEAD OUT INTO THE OPEN LAKE

-This is so nice.
-Right?

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.240
So nice.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.044
It's so cool. That's how it works.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.112
Put one log in.

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.280
PLANNER TYPE

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.581
Okay.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.150
Since we're turning left...

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.052
[Jung Kook] This is how we go left.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.153
Mind if I try it?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.855
JIMIN TRIES STEERING THE BOAT

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.558
-Keep it like this.
-Yeah, that's the plan.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.426
I kinda feel like a captain.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.597
CHECKS THE FIREPIT TOO

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.132
Oh, that's what heats it up.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.303
V SIGN

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.979
Wow, this is such a unique experience.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:48.315
Taking a bath in the middle of a lake.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.016
A RARE AND SPECIAL MOMENT

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.651
Should we toast?

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.386
Sure. Is this beer?

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.855
READY TO TOAST AT THIS MOMENT

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.592
I'll try it.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.362
SOUND OF BEER

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.397

[grunts]

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.250
By the way,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.852
you think you can jump in the water?

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.921
I don't want to. It's cold.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.189
[Jimin chuckles]

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:30.724
Your saliva's dripping.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.858
Because it's cold.

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:33.460
It happens when it's cold.

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:35.362
I'm up for anything.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.032
MAX CONFIDENCE

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.333
You're going in?

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.702
Jimin says he's going.

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.772
It'll look like I'm really going, right?

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.707
I was planning to float right here.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.711
IT WAS FAKE

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.181
CHECKING THE LAKE TEMPERATURE,
JUST IN CASE (?)

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.383

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.023
TINGLING

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.859
Run away.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:06.927
Run!

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.929
-Together?
-Together.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.230
-Right now?
-Yeah.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.038
What pose?

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.839
Shout "Are You Sure?!" and jump.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.274
[in English] Okay, okay.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.510
[in Korean] One, two, three.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.812
Are You Sure?! What?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.249
JIMIN GOT TRICKED...

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.986
[exclaims]

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.721
JUNG KOOK PRETENDED TO JUMP TOGETHER

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.790
BUT FAKED IT, LOL

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:40.827
Hey, what the heck?

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.762
What the heck?

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.467
PURE JOY

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.668
REVENGE

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:51.137
[both laughing]

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.273
Ah, I'm scared.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.809
[exclaims]

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:58.244
TRIED DIPPING HIS HAND IN

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.314
ENDS UP FALLING IN AGAIN HIMSELF

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:02.549
What happened?

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.817
I fell in.

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:06.553
Okay, let's go.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.822
We're not leaving until you jump too.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.290
SECOND ATTEMPT

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:11.925
It's freezing.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.026
It's so cold.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:16.296
[director] We'll give you some pork belly
if you do this.

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:17.364
Okay.

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.666
PERSUADED IN 1 SECOND

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:21.768
I'm really good at handling people.

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.471
Jung Kook agreed right away.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.606
"We'll give you pork belly." "Okay!"

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.875
A MAN EASILY SWAYED BY FOOD

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.276
-Now's the time.
-Yeah.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.344
READY TO JUMP IN

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.013
We have to shout "Are You Sure?!"

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.748
Like, "Are You Sure?!"

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.549
I'm ready.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:39.185
One, two, three.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.321
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.091
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.561
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.667
It's cold.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:55.769
So cold.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.971
Freezing.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.073
It's so cold.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.412
QUICKLY RETURNING TO THE HOT TUG

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.114
Wow, seriously.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:09.816
Oh, man.

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:13.353
CHECKING HOW THEY LOOK
EVEN AFTER JUMPING IN THE WATER

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.955
Let's swim all the way over there.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.490
It's going to be so cold.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.593
It's beautiful, that's youth for you.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:22.896
You know?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.170
SWIM TOGETHER?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.938
I don't think you'll join me.

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.940
-I'll go if you go.
-Really?

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.476
-Pre-heating.
-Pre-cooling.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:37.710
Pre-cooling?

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.781
PRE-COOLING(?) BEFORE JUMPING IN

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:44.084
-I'm done pre-cooling.
-Let's go.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.151
Let's go.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.922
JIMIN JUMPS IN FIRST THIS TIME TOO

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:51.624
BUT IT'S SO COLD...

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.260
NOT AGAIN...?

00:09:55.795 --> 00:10:00.567
THIS TIME, A BOLD DIVE

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:07.273
SWIMMING IN A FAIRYTALE-LIKE LANDSCAPE

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.044
A MOMENT THAT WILL STAY
IN MEMORY LIKE A PAINTING

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.278
Jimin!

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.881
-Jimin.
-Why are you so fast?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.283
SUDDENLY TURNS INTO A CHASE SCENE

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.918
This feels good.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:23.123
Moving around makes it a bit better.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:28.461
JIMIN LETS HIMSELF FLOAT
AND GETS LOST IN THE VIEW

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:31.164
SUDDENLY CHARGES TOWARD THE CAMERA (?)

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.166
Dog paddle.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.704
[both laughing]

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.743
DOUBLE SPIN

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.011
HUH?

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.480
We're getting farther from the boat.

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:50.617
Like we're drifting away.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.352
DRIFTING FARTHER AWAY...

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:55.822
HEADING BACK BEFORE THEY GET TOO FAR

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:57.957
Let's go.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.659
-How do I even move?
-Just go.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.861
I'll paddle with my feet.

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.263
I'll paddle with my hands.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:07.934
A BRAND-NEW TWO-PERSON SWIMMING TECHNIQUE

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:11.204
It's not cold anymore.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.207
You'll be freezing once you get in again.

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:17.710
TIME TO WARM THEMSELVES UP
BACK IN THE HOT TUG

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:18.845
What is this?

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.116
-Nice.
-Nice.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.184
SPLASH

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.754
NEVER-ENDING PRANKS

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.790
-It reminds me of the army days.
-Yes, it's been a while.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.192
It's been a while.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.461
That wasn't it.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.330
This is it.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.205
COUNTERATTACK BEGINS

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.875
GETTING BACK TENFOLD FOR WHAT HE DID

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:52.779
FINAL SPLASH

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.915
REVENGE COMPLETE

00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.884
That was pretty much my military life.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.287
I hit first and get it back
seven times harder.

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:06.159
I think people would probably expect us
to have a conversation here.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.561
It just turned into
a full-on variety show.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.566
Do you want to go over there?

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.068
-All the way?
-Yeah.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.903
Okay. Let's go all the way.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.738
Let's go. Let's go for it.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.139
HEADING TOWARDS THE OTHER END

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.008
ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:26.079
[Jimin &amp; Jung Kook singing]

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:31.651
[continues singing]

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:37.090
LIKE IN CHILDREN'S CARTOONS

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:41.227
THEY GO ON AN ADVENTURE
TO THE END OF THE LAKE

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:44.664
THEY GO ON AN ADVENTURE
TO THE END OF THE LAKE

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:49.168
HE NEVER FORGETS TO BE ON CAMERA

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.705
SECURING A CAMERA SHOT
FOR JUNG KOOK, TOO

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.009
[Jung Kook singing]

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:58.911
Right here, swoosh.

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.047
Spin.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.448
Whirlpool.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:09.022
[humming theme
of "Pirates of the Caribbean"]

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:15.061
SUDDENLY TURNS INTO
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.129
Twice...

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.230
Twice already...

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.799
[together] Abandoned
on this wretched island.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.335
AN INTRUDER(?) APPEARS

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:24.337
THE INTRUDER

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.406
-What's their problem?
-Those punks.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:27.774
Let's go that way.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:30.009
Set sail, full speed ahead.

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:34.113
THEIR VOYAGE BEGINS AGAIN

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.016
CAPTAIN JEON HOLDING THE HELM

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.952
AND NAVIGATOR PARK CHECKING THE ROUTE

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.855
-Captain, to the left.
-Yes.

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.490
To the left?

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.692
Isn't it to the right?

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:48.328
THE BOAT TURNING TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.030
That's correct.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:55.401
RECHECKING THE ROUTE

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:58.604
Let's go. Time to eat.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.373
Carbonara.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.275
Carbonara again.

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.579
-Chase them.
-Chase them.

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:08.915
Say hi. Wave your hand.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.450
Get closer.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.418
-Closer, closer.
-Closer.

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:14.220
Block the way.

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:16.255
Block the ferry's path.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:19.992
HOT TUG BOAT SUDDENLY STARTS ROCKING

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:22.261
FACING CRISIS

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.897
Captain, the ship's about to sink.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.165
Stay calm!

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.835
-Captain.
-Stay calm.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:32.038
It's just waves made by that ship.

00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:33.573
-Captain.
-Yeah?

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.175
When are we landing, Captain?

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.243
Just wait a bit.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.645
THE CONFIDENT CAPTAIN'S SECRET

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.949
Isn't it over there? No? Is it that way?

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:45.118
Our boat went that way, right?

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.185
No?

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.587
Our boat wasn't there.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.155
-It's there, right?
-Are you sure?

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.790
Isn't it that way?

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:51.891
I don't think so.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.025
I don't know the way.

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.895
Where are we supposed to go?

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:58.097
Which way do we go to get home?

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.869
We don't have a radio.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.573
-We do.
-Huh?

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.109
-[director over radio] Can you hear me?
-Yes.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.711
Yes.

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.146
Here it is.

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.480
-This is it.
-Right.

00:15:14.547 --> 00:15:17.049
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:20.086
Where the big ship
that looks like a ferry is,

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:24.123
we're supposed to land there,
I mean, dock there, right?

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.025
Yes. Come straight ahead.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.226
[in English] Roger that.

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:29.262
Say "copy that."

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:33.332
-[in Korean] Copy that.
-Copy that.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.968
Only real pros say that kind of stuff.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:39.672
-Should we steer it toward that ship?
-Yeah.

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:41.607
-You can drive well, right?
-Yes.

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:42.909
Just ram it.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.445
Those people are totally filming us.

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.614
HOT TUG DOESN'T OPERATE IN SUMMER
SO THEY MUST LOOK LIKE A RARE SIGHT

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.016
Let's go, speed up.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.217
We can't go faster.

00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:54.320
[Jimin] Is this max power?

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:55.788
RUNNING AT FULL SPEED

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.191
Informing we're being photographed.

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:01.160
TRYING TO RADIO THE CREW AGAIN

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:02.895
Using a really nice camera.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.931
Even saw a flash earlier.

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:08.201
Someone's filming on their phone too.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.502
We're doomed.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.103
It's so embarrassing.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:15.541
We're shaking in embarrassment.

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:21.147
SOMEHOW MAKING IT BACK TO THE DOCK

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:23.549
-[in English] Good driver.
-Yeah, he's the captain.

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:25.318
[in English] Yeah, captain.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:26.752
Captain, you're doing good.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.954
-Good.
-Yeah.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.021
Very good, man.

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.356
GOOD DRIVER CAPTAIN JEON

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:31.858
-How was it?
-Good.

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:33.860
-Good experience? Nice.
-Yeah.

-Okay.

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:20.326
Not bad.

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.994
When I see machines...

00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:24.897
-You're totally hopeless with machines.
-Yeah.

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.533
OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS TECH-DUMMY

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:30.402
-Jung Kook, I'll cook rice tomorrow.
-Sounds great.

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.905
-I'm going to make rice in this pot.
-Okay.

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:35.741
No, actually, since we're all
eating together...

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.277
-I'll use a big pot instead.
-Nice.

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:41.413
I watched like 40 minutes
of rice-cooking videos.

00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:44.249
-There's skin on this.
-Yes.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.317
Peel it?

00:24:45.384 --> 00:24:46.618
CHECKING THE MEAT

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:48.253
-[Jimin] Start with the skin?
-Yes.

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.656
-Make it crispy?
-Yes.

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:53.625
All right. Then I'll set the dishes.

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:54.893
The edge...

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.765
-You can put the meat here.
-Okay.

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:01.066
SETTING THE TABLE

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:05.204
As for the veggies,
just rinse them lightly with water.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.271
Okay.

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.440
Maybe a bit of olive oil?

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:11.143
-I'll go grab the camera.
-Sure.

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.946
You have to coat it with oil.

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:17.816
THE MAILLARD REACTION
OCCURS WHEN MEAT IS GRILLED

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:19.785
GIVES BROWNED FOOD ITS DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.022
See that?

00:25:23.088 --> 00:25:24.590
GOLDEN BROWN

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:27.326
Oh, that looks so good.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.865
BEGINS COOKING MEAT IN EARNEST

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.967
Just a light sprinkle of salt.

00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:39.805
AND A DASH OF PEPPER

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.341
No timer. No, I won't set it.

00:25:42.408 --> 00:25:45.611
FLUSTERED FINGERS

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:50.249
I don't really like pork belly
cooked too crispy.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.316
ALREADY?

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.419
Since we're eating it with ramyeon,

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.287
-I won't season it too much.
-Okay.

00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:58.323
INHALING

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.292
UP

00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:01.360
DOWN

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:02.428
UP

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.196
TREMBLING

00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:08.767
POSE

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.203
Now's the moment.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.739
TITLE: PERFECT TIMING, PERFECT SHOT

00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:15.941
THIS TIME, A SELFIE WITHOUT JUNG KOOK

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:18.444
TITLE: DON'T LOSE TO THE FLASH

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.745
Where are the scissors?

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.214
[chuckles] Leave it to me.

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:25.317
Cut this in half.

00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:27.386
THE PERFECT ASSISTANT FINDS IT IN ONE GO

00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:29.254
-I'll cut it here.
-Okay.

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:33.092
EXCLAIMING

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:34.326
You can eat it now.

00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:37.663
Do you like it crispy
or a bit undercooked?

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.731
-Medium. Yeah.
-Right? Good.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.540
JUNG-KOOK-IS-GREAT PERFORMANCE

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:52.010
WITH JIMIN'S CHEERING

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:55.080
Should we grill two more strips?

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:56.281
FIRST BATCH DONE

00:26:56.849 --> 00:26:57.983
Maybe three more?

00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:01.153
-Three? Two?
-Two?

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.255
-Three.
-Okay.

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:05.357
THREE MORE STRIPS!

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:08.460
Jimin, should we start boiling
the noodles now?

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:09.561
Okay.

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.497
GETTING READY TO COOK THE RAMYEON

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.098
Sounds great.

00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:16.502
SAUCE PACKETS ARE SET ASIDE

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:17.970
GAZE FIXED

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:19.638
Cooked really fast.

00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:21.507
RAMYEON CHEF SUDDENLY DROOLING

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:22.574
Looks so good.

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.177
-What?
-It looks so good.

00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:28.313
2ND ATTACK TO THEIR SALIVARY GLANDS

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.149
It's so simple today.

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:31.717
What does it say on the back?

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:34.086
How are we supposed to cook it?

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.488
-Boil for five minutes.
-Okay.

00:27:36.555 --> 00:27:39.858
Leave about eight spoonfuls
of water and mix.

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:44.096
Since it's three bags, 24 spoonfuls.

00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:46.398
-We'll eyeball it.
-Okay.

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:48.267
I like it with a little water left.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.170
-I'll put them in.
-Okay.

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:52.871
NOODLES IN THE POT

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:55.174
DINNER PREP GOING SMOOTHLY

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.241
It's so glistening.

00:27:57.543 --> 00:27:59.077
Just one more minute.

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.579
You can turn it off then.

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:02.548
-Sounds good.
-In one minute, I'll mix it.

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.216
While you're mixing, I'll cut.

00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:05.651
-Okay.
-Next.

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.452
Wash the veggies.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.221
I'll wash them nicely.

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.790
-It'd be perfect if I could do it now.
-You forgot?

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.593
No, I just knew I'd mess it up
if I looked away.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.295
I don't trust myself.

00:28:18.197 --> 00:28:22.701
CHECKING NOODLE QUALITY

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:24.503
-Perfect. Do it now.
-Now?

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.873
[Jimin] Need to eyeball exactly
24 spoonfuls of water.

00:28:29.308 --> 00:28:32.177
OUCH, HOT

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:33.946
TREMBLING

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:36.248
Even the lid's hot now. Oh, no.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.954
TIME FOR PATIENCE

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:45.390
I DID IT

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.192
Okay, I think it's perfect.

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:48.627
Okay, let's go.

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:50.095
I trust you completely.

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:51.897
Pouring it all in.

00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:52.998
Of course.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.468
-What do we do?
-Is this a bone?

00:28:56.535 --> 00:28:58.003
What should we do?

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.739
-What, it just looks too good?
-Mouthwatering.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:03.442
I learned this from Jung Kook.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.876
APPLYING JUNG KOOK'S TECHNIQUE

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.745
Not leaving a single drop behind.

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:08.347
He likes it that way.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:10.882
-[Jung Kook] Super creamy.
-Creamy, creamy.

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.384
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:14.119
-Go?
-Veggies.

00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:16.788
LETTUCE BOUQUET DEPLOYED

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:17.856
TEARING

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.992
-None left. None.
-None?

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:21.093
WASHING

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:23.362
-I'll rinse the lettuce lightly.
-Okay.

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:27.232
LETTUCE SHOWER... A BIT TOO VIGOROUS

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:30.802
CRISPY-ON-THE-OUTSIDE, JUICY-ON-THE-INSIDE

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.738
AND CREAMY, SPICY CARBONARA

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:33.972
A CAN'T-GO-WRONG COMBO

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.741
-[Jung Kook] Let's dig in.
-Let's eat.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:37.643
I always start with a wrap.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:38.710
IN A HURRY

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.679
-Let's get one more shot.
-Okay.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:42.514
BUT THEY CAN'T WAIT

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.815
I should do that too.

00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:49.121
I don't eat the wraps normally.
I put the noodles on top.

00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:51.390
-Mmm!
-And eat it like that.

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:54.393
-Enjoy.
-Yeah.

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.994
-Jimin, let's enjoy.
-Okay.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:00.432
PORK BELLY + CARBONARA RAMEN WRAP

00:30:00.499 --> 00:30:04.202
NOODLES ONLY

00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:06.705
DELICIOUS

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:07.973
So good.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:10.175
BEER IS A MUST

00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:13.145
-♪ Not a single day goes by ♪
-♪ Without a drink ♪

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.481
-Cheers.
-Good work today.

00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:22.120
The meat's insane.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:24.589
The noodles are insane.

00:30:26.892 --> 00:30:28.827
The noodles instead of rice.

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:32.631
PORK BELLY + CARBONARA RAMEN WRAP

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:36.535
LOVING IT

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.403
-This is it.
-The wrap.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:44.843
TINGLING

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.911
So good.

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:50.615
Honestly, I like it this way,
thicker and creamier.

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:52.784
It goes perfectly with the meat.

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:56.655
CHOMP

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:04.096
THE TYPE TO STICK WITH ONE COMBO
ONCE HE FINDS HIS FAVORITE

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.164
EATS MEAT SEPARATELY

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.467
EATS NOODLES SEPARATELY

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.602
EVEN THE LETTUCE... JIMIN'S STYLE

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:12.070
[sighs contentedly]

00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:14.806
This might be the best thing here.

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:17.876
The skin's chewy. It makes it even better.

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:18.944
Yeah.

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.946
-Mmm!
-This is true joy.

00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:26.818
STRONGLY AGREES

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:29.888
I actually thought Bibimmen would

00:31:29.955 --> 00:31:32.491
go best with the meat.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.227
But this Carbonara one is something else.

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:39.498
-It really is.
-This could take first place in my heart.

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.033
-Seriously.
-When you eat it with this...

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.337
You know, we usually ate it
with regular ramen.

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.706
-I think this one is a bit better.
-Yeah.

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:50.275
It's something...

00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:52.244
this one.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.546
SCRAPING THE BOTTOM CLEAN

00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:56.815
One-and-a-half packets
are perfect for a guy.

00:31:56.882 --> 00:31:58.450
-You're not eating?
-I am.

00:31:58.517 --> 00:32:01.520
THE REST IS ALL MINE

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:03.822
This gives it a kick.

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:08.326
Perfectly finished, just right.

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.561
LAST LETTUCE

00:32:09.628 --> 00:32:12.931
SCRAPING IT AGAIN

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:14.666
We really finished it.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.970
CLEARED EVERY LAST BITE

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:20.472
That was so good.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.808
[sighs]

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:25.444
CHEERS

00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:30.115
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MEAL

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:33.485
-Thank you for the meal.
-It was amazing.

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:38.690
I'm honestly shocked
at how perfectly full I am right now.

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:40.058
[Jimin] Before.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.427
And after.

00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:47.232
AFTER A MEAL THAT FILLED
BOTH STOMACH AND HEART...

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.000
You won the game earlier, right?

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.068
Huh?

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:51.203
ALLOWANCE TIME

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:52.270
Thank you.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.672
Ah!

00:32:54.573 --> 00:32:57.075
I'll keep it safe.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.513
What kind of exciting things
await us tomorrow?

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.415
-Should we clean up first?
-Okay.

00:33:05.517 --> 00:33:06.985
-Let's tidy up.
-Good work.

00:33:07.052 --> 00:33:09.387
-Good work.
-Slate, please.

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.389
We should do it from afar.

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.592
One, two, three.

00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:15.894
[Jung Kook] That was great.

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:16.995
[Jimin] So great.

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:18.063
A PERFECT DAY

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:21.800
There are no blind spots in here.
We should change in the bathroom.

00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:22.868
No.

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.769
We'll just make one.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.206
JIMIN SAYS, "IF IT DOESN'T EXIST,
MAKE IT YOURSELF."

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.210
TIME TO SAY BYE FOR NOW

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:35.213
Off to a cozy sleep.

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.350
-Do you want to do something?
-No.

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.684
Rock, paper, scissors?

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:40.986
Forehead flick?

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.220
Forehead flick?

00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:44.523
-The real last round.
-Just one game.

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:45.891
Until someone gets hit.

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:47.492
-Just one round.
-Yup.

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:50.529
1-ON-1 ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS,
ZERO GAME, AND CHAM CHAM CHAM

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.197
Ooh.

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:55.867
Zero, zero, zero.

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:57.402
JUNG KOOK WINS ZERO GAME

00:33:57.469 --> 00:33:58.503
Not this one.

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.338
Cham Cham Cham.

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.840
-A bit late, huh?
-Nope, nope.

00:34:01.907 --> 00:34:04.142
I was only thinking of this side.

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.244
Rock, paper.

00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:07.846
ROUND TWO BEGINS

00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:08.914
Zero, zero, zero.

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.448
Rock, paper.

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:11.516
A CLOSE MATCH(?)

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:13.852
-Zero, zero, zero.
-Should've said "one."

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.254
SO CLOSE

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:19.224
[exhaling]

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:21.726
Rock, paper,

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.128
-scissors.
-Scissors.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.296
Paper.

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.131
PERFECT SYNC

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:28.300
Shall we end the match here?

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.367
On a good note?

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:31.836
-You're not bad.
-You're not bad either.

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:32.904
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:34.539
ENDS WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.276
-You're good.
-You're good.

00:34:38.343 --> 00:34:39.711
Pretty good, huh?

00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:41.813
I've always been.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.715
You're something.

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:47.452
GAME OF PROS... OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.825
TIME TO SLEEP FOR A FRESH TOMORROW

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:59.264
WHEN THE DARKNESS FADES
AND THE SUN RISES

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:02.867
A SPARKLING MORNING GREETS BRIENZ

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:06.571
GOOD MORNING

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:10.875
JUNG KOOK IS UP EARLY

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:13.044
Here's my morning face.

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.414
Feeling great.

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.718
WHILE JUNG KOOK ENJOYS
THE BRIENZ MORNING SUNLIGHT...

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:25.090
JIMIN IS STILL IN DREAMLAND

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:31.830
FIGHTING A BATTLE WITH HIMSELF

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.632
[singing]

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.033
It's so beautiful outside.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.636
The director went for a walk

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:39.070
and said it's amazing.

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.438
-Where? Near here?
-Yeah.

00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:47.045
HESITATES

00:35:47.112 --> 00:35:50.015
STAFF ARE ALREADY SETTING THINGS UP
FOR THE SHOOT

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:51.683
Setting up cameras here too.

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:56.755
CAMERAS BEING INSTALLED ALL AROUND

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.823
Everyone's so hardworking.

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.993
I actually woke up early too.

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.397
-[Jimin] Let's start filming.
-Okay.

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:06.931
[director] Cameras are rolling.

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.167
FILMING BEGINS

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.739
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

00:36:14.806 --> 00:36:17.075
I slept really well thanks to you.

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:18.510
What happened to your voice?

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.879
I lost my voice.

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.080
Really?

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:23.314
Yes.

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.918
I think I yelled too much
while swimming yesterday.

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:28.486
That's probably why.

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:31.322
SHOUTING WHEN HE SLIPPED ALONE

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.124
Are You Sure?! What?

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.325
EVEN WHEN HE JUMPED

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:38.430
-[Jung Kook laughing]
-What the heck?

00:36:39.164 --> 00:36:40.265
What the heck?

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.736
JIMIN SCREAMED THE WHOLE TIME

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:50.475
[director] So now, we'll start
with a morning game.

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:52.143
Through this game,

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.047
we'll decide
whether you get a free day today

00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:59.784
or stick to the schedule as we planned.

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:01.786
If we get a free day,

00:37:01.853 --> 00:37:04.355
I think they'll take our phones.

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.727
I SAW RIGHT THROUGH YOU, DIDN'T I?

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:11.463
-Right, they haven't taken them yet.
-Yes, they will.

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:14.265
And we have to think about
what to do on camera.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.868
Let's do forehead flicks.

00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:18.503
We didn't do it last night.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.040
[director] All right,
so today's game is...

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:23.508
Charades.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:24.743
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.411
-You know it, right?
-Yeah.

00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:28.246
That's good.

00:37:28.313 --> 00:37:30.548
It's hard for me to talk right now.

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:31.950
EVEN BETTER

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:36.688
[director] So here we have categories:
proverbs, objects, animals,

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.923
-[Jung Kook] Emotions.
-and movies.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.492
[director] These are the options.

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.127
Emotions sound good.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.428
Should we go with that?

00:37:43.495 --> 00:37:44.863
Okay, let's do emotions.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.464
Let's get started.

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:49.367
You guess, I'll act it out.

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:51.936
The one acting stands there,

00:37:52.504 --> 00:37:55.140
and the one guessing sits there.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.242
HYPING IT UP

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:58.309
Excited.

00:37:59.244 --> 00:38:01.379
I can't hide my excitement.

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:03.915
DANCING OUT THE EXCITEMENT(?)

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:06.151
-[director] I'll time you.
-Okay.

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:10.255
In two minutes,
if you get seven right, you win.

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.723
That's kinda tough.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.491
[Jimin] Can we do a practice round?

00:38:13.558 --> 00:38:14.893
Just one randomly.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.227
[director] Randomly? Okay.

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:20.732
PRACTICE QUESTION IN PROGRESS

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.835
Regret? No?

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.171
I'm too tired to go there.

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:32.110
Read me better.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.979
PRACTICE ROUND, SECOND TRY

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.381
Wow, that's crazy.

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:39.150
I got brain freeze.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.820
How am I supposed to guess that?

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:45.690
-I'll make it super intuitive from now.
-It won't be like that.

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:47.759
-Ready.
-Ready?

00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:49.494
[director] Two minutes, let's go.

00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:50.662
Skip if you don't know.

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.397
-[director] Ready.
-Pass?

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:53.464
[director] Start.

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:56.234
CHARADES START

00:38:56.301 --> 00:38:57.302
KEYWORD: HORRIFIED

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.237
KEYWORD CONFIRMED

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.339
Disgusted?

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:03.074
Unpleasant? Annoyed?

00:39:03.141 --> 00:39:04.742
NO, THAT'S NOT IT

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:06.277
Frustrated? What is that?

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.980
What is that?

00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:11.082
-What is it?
-Skip.

00:39:11.149 --> 00:39:13.151
-Horrified.
-Oh, horrified.

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:15.253
-Tempted?
-Correct.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.487
FRUSTRATED

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.389
-Frustrated.
-Correct.

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:19.557
ANGER

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:21.860
-Angry?
-Correct.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:23.928
FEAR
BODY CURLING UP(?)

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:27.465
Scared?

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.634
CLOSE!

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:30.702
Panic?

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:31.769
MAKING FACES

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:32.837
Afraid.

00:39:32.904 --> 00:39:34.038
GASP

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:35.106
FACIAL SYNC #2

00:39:35.173 --> 00:39:36.708
-Fear.
-Correct.

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:39.244
FOUR ANSWERS CORRECT SO FAR

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.979
YOU GUYS TRY GUESSING TOO

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.046
Ecstatic?

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:45.450
HUMMING

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:46.584
Happy?

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.853
-Refreshed.
-Correct.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.790
PARK JIMIN WHO FEELS REFRESHED
AFTER A SHOWER

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.159
Annoyed?

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.596
LOSING IT
JIMIN WHEN HE'S LOSING IT

00:39:58.663 --> 00:40:00.932
-Smashing everything.
-Skip.

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.001
BIG INHALE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.068
BIG EXHALE

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:05.169
What is that?

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.371
Happy?

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:07.672
Surprised? Happy?

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:08.907
JOY

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:09.974
Ecstasy?

What is it?

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.247
What's that?

00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:17.582
I AM HAPPY RIGHT NOW

00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:18.650
What?

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:20.885
What, what?

They all look the same.

They all look the same.

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.360
NO, THEY'RE DIFFERENT

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:30.461
Ecstatic, happy.

FIGHTING SOMETHING INVISIBLE

Dull.

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.642
Empty.

-[director] Ten seconds.
-Dull... No.

00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:49.013
Sentimental?

UPSET

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:53.217
EXPRESSING BOREDOM WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.752
Bored?

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:55.820
Bored?

00:40:56.354 --> 00:40:57.588
Correct. Time's up.

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.993
How many did we get?

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.228
You got six.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.897
-Missed one?
-Yeah.

00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:07.131
-That was tough.
-But...

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:09.000
What was this one?

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:10.501
-Joy.
-Oh, joy.

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.937
But honestly...

00:41:13.004 --> 00:41:16.341
WHY DO ALL HIS EXPRESSIONS
LOOK THE SAME...?

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:20.645
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT EMOTIONS

00:41:20.712 --> 00:41:24.949
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK CLOSELY...

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.951
How do you act out "shocked"?

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:28.019
Shocked?

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.254
No idea.

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.324
HE DID HIS BEST TODAY AS ALWAYS

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:34.592
We go six correct?

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:35.760
You got six right.

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:37.895
That was good practice, right?

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.999
Right? You gotta warm up a bit.

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:42.066
It's morning.

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:44.635
LET'S CALL IT A PRACTICE ROUND

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:45.703
PLEASE

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.071
[director] A practice round?

00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:48.706
YES, YES

00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:51.109
EASILY(?) EARNED AN EXTRA GAME

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:54.779
Proverbs, objects, animals, or movies.

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.148
I don't really know many movies...

00:41:57.215 --> 00:41:59.083
-Animals?
-Should we try animals?

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.518
Movies sound fun though.

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:01.786
Movies?

00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:03.287
You sure about that?

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.957
I'm okay with whatever you want.

00:42:06.024 --> 00:42:07.025
Animals?

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.526
Animals? Okay.

00:42:08.593 --> 00:42:11.195
Then should I act and you guess?

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.630
Should I do it?

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:15.299
-Whatever you want.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:21.406
You want to guess, or should I?

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:23.374
I'm not that good at giving hints.

00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:24.909
Then I'll act it out.

00:42:24.976 --> 00:42:26.077
-Animals?
-Yup.

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:28.646
[director] Okay, once you're both ready,

00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:30.448
say "Go" and start.

00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:31.849
Didn't say "Go" earlier.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:32.984
One, two, three.

00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.052
-Go.
-Go.

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:35.753

-An ostrich.
-Ostrich, oh, right.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:35.673

PROUD OF THE STRIPE DETAIL

00:44:37.575 --> 00:44:38.876
Zebra was good though.

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:41.245
I thought it could fly.
Ostriches can't fly.

[director] Yes, which means
you've earned free time.

You can spend it however you want,

00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.862
or follow the plan we prepared,
a jet-boat ride.

00:44:57.929 --> 00:44:59.664
Which will you pick? Free time?

WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:04.569
Maybe on the way to the first spot,
we'll search things up.

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.003
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.405

It's called the "roof of Interlaken."

There's even a flower garden.

00:45:56.721 --> 00:45:58.723

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:03.287
-So we're driving.
-Yeah.

00:47:03.354 --> 00:47:05.423
I'll connect the GPS with my phone.

00:47:07.525 --> 00:47:10.928
SOMETHING'S OFF

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:13.264
Turn off Bluetooth? It's linked to yours.

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:14.765
Should I disconnect mine?

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:18.169
Or we can just use yours.

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.471
-Really? It only has my songs.
-Yeah.

00:47:20.538 --> 00:47:22.540
-Send me the address.
-Okay.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.443
SETTING OFF

00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:28.012
Connect it up.

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:31.215
TODAY'S NAVIGATOR

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:32.583
Not walking.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.952
NAVIGATOR BRIEFLY LOSES THE WAY

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.854
NAVIGATION CONNECTED

00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:38.322
[GPS voice] Turn right.

00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:40.658
Then turn left.

00:47:40.725 --> 00:47:42.560
-Oh.
-You can mute that voice.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.962
I've actually never had
the sound on before.

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:47.865
NAVIGATOR TURNING OFF VOICE GUIDANCE

00:47:47.932 --> 00:47:50.701
[GPS voice] Turn right in 150 meters.

00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:52.002
Turn right.

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:54.372
Then turn right again.

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:57.174
He talks so kindly and softly.

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:59.944
Wait, is the address right?

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.779
Did I set it to the Pizzeria? Oh...

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:02.847
Pizzeria?

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:03.914
WRONG PLACE

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:06.584
No wonder it kept rerouting.

00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:09.687
NAVIGATOR RESETTING THE ROUTE

00:48:09.754 --> 00:48:13.491
Just go straight for 14 km.

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.558
Okay.

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.862
The weather's amazing.

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:23.000
BRIENZ IS EVEN CLEARER AND BLUER
AFTER YESTERDAY'S RAIN

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:26.270
CAPTURING TODAY'S PERFECT WEATHER

00:48:26.337 --> 00:48:29.640
#RIGHT_SIDE_VIEW
#CRAZY_WEATHER

00:48:29.707 --> 00:48:32.476
FOCUSED EYEBROWS

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:36.981
#LEFT_SIDE_VIEW
#EMERALD_LAKE #SO_BEAUTIFUL

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:44.488
DRIVING WHILE TAKING IN BRIENZ

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:47.525
Jung Kook, that boat's crossing the lake.

00:48:49.994 --> 00:48:52.029
[Jung Kook] Isn't that the one we took?

00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:54.698
[Jimin] I think it is. It runs every day.

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.034
FERRY IS A COMMON FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:58.803
SAME ONE AS THEY TOOK YESTERDAY

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:03.107
ENJOYING THE LAKESIDE DRIVE

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.043
SPOTTED A RIVER FLOWING ALONGSIDE THE ROAD

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:10.080
The color of the river here is
different, though.

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:12.149
In Zermatt, it was kind of grayish.

00:49:12.216 --> 00:49:13.451
The river itself?

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.686
Yeah, this one's emerald.

00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:17.154
This one's got a more...

00:49:17.221 --> 00:49:18.956
[Jimin] A bright, saturated tone.

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:25.129
GLACIAL WATER FROM THE ALPS
CREATES A DEEP EMERALD HUE

00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:30.801
Switzerland's really the perfect place
to drive.

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.637
It makes you want to drive.

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:35.906
It feels so good.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:37.641
It was great when I rode the bike.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.444
-[Jimin] Except for the heat?
-Yeah.

00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:42.012
[Jimin] I'd be too scared.

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.317
I feel so drowsy today.

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:47.551
[Jung Kook] Right?

00:49:47.618 --> 00:49:49.320
When it's sunny, you get drowsy.

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:51.255
But rain doesn't drag you down.

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.823
-It actually lifts you up.
-Yes.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.993
Yeah, I even thought earlier
I kinda wanted it to rain today.

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:00.698
When it rains after being sunny,
it's so nice and refreshing.

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:03.367
[Jung Kook] This city goes well with rain.

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:04.435
[Jimin] I agree.

00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:06.670
A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAUTY ON RAINY DAYS

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:09.440
The slightly wet colors are
just beautiful.

00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.342
[Jung Kook] My aesthetic sense says so.

00:50:12.276 --> 00:50:13.777
Your aesthetic sense's rising.

00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:15.613
"Rising"?

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.147
Rising, that sounds weird.

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:19.250
-What?
-Like in "That's right."

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.985
You can just say "right."

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.553
Yeah, why did I say that?

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.621
Two syllables.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.022
Mixed in some dialect.

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:27.391
-O-reu-ding.
-O-reu-daeng-daeng.

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:31.629
STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS CONVERSATION

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:36.133
BEATBOX, DEVELOPED VERSION

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.103
Like playing multiple instruments at once?

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:40.170
That's pretty cool.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.906
-You're cooler.
-Why?

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:43.407
You're copying it.

00:50:43.474 --> 00:50:44.842
COPY PUPPY

00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:48.145
DRIVING WHILE BEATBOXING

00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:52.283
-What kind of place is this?
-No idea.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.286
-Check the menu? Okay.
-Can you check?

00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:57.154
They've got burgers and fries.

00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:58.389
BURGER SHOP

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:01.425
-[Jimin] It must be famous.
-Yeah.

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:05.863
[Jimin] Director mentioned a must-visit
burger place before. This must be it.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.198
HEADING INTO DOWNTOWN INTERLAKEN

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:12.836
BEATBOXING IN CELEBRATION OF NEARING LUNCH

00:51:16.307 --> 00:51:18.208
[Jimin] They all do head-in parking here.

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:22.279
HEAD-IN PARKING, SUCCESS IN ONE GO

00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:23.814
[Jung Kook in English] Let's go.

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:24.882
[in Korean] Let's go!

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:27.017
LET'S GO EAT!

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:31.589
WALKING IN A SINGLE LINE

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:35.025
THEY WALK RIGHT PAST THE ENTRANCE

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:37.928
WHERE ARE YOU GOING...?

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:39.063
It's here?

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.531
Oh, this is the entrance.

00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:41.732
RETURNING

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.667
Huh?

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:45.135
Go in and sit there?

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:47.171
[Jimin chuckles] Ah!

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:48.606
I couldn't pick that up.

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:50.040
[in English] Nice to meet you.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.976
[Jung Kook in English] Nice to meet you.

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:55.045
FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.280
Ah.

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:01.352
[in Korean] They're filming diagonally.

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.888
JIMIN CHECKS THE MENU FIRST

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.758
Wait, we have to pay
with our allowance, right?

00:52:07.825 --> 00:52:09.259
[director] Lunch? Yes, correct.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.095
Let's see.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.264
[in Korean] We've got
almost 100 francs left.

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:15.633
DON'T LET THE STAFF KNOW...

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:21.372
Let's see what they have.

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.643
CAREFULLY READING THE MENU

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.980
Let's get this one, Crazy In Love.
Our special.

00:52:30.047 --> 00:52:32.583
BIG APPROVAL + DOUBLE THUMBS UP

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.917
Let's get this one.

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:35.819
ABOUT 47,000 WON

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.221
Oh, it's pricey.

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:40.090
-We can share one if it's big enough.
-Right.

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.459
Let's get two singles and one side.

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.527
Should we?

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:46.363
HUMAN CALCULATOR MODE

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.633
The combo's cheaper by 1 franc.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.635
ORDERING 1 COMBO + 1 SINGLE

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:53.937
-Okay, perfect.
-[in English] And fries.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.707
WITH A SIDE OF FRENCH FRIES

00:52:56.774 --> 00:52:59.777
STRONG HAND GESTURE SAYING
"WE'LL SPLIT THE BILL"

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:01.679
[in Korean] Shutting us down right away.

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:04.081
-Thank you very much.
-[in English] Thank you.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.249
ANYWAY, ORDER COMPLETE

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:06.417
Looks good.

00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:10.688
[Jung Kook in English] So many sparrows
around burger places.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.556
Because people feed them fries.

00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:14.892
I think I like burgers as a food.

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:17.094
I never realized it before.

00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:18.762
I think I like them.

00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:21.598
I didn't know I liked pasta
this much either.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.968
JUNG KOOK, LOOK AT THIS

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:26.804
Where'd you hide my photo?

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.273
HE DID SOMETHING WITH JUNG KOOK'S PHOTO...

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.642
I couldn't even find it.

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:34.211
A PHOTO OF JUNG KOOK PHOTOSHOPPED BY JIMIN

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:36.246
[Jimin] It's even funnier
when you zoom in.

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:38.749
ZOOMED-IN: SOULFUL-EYED JUNG KOOK
FILLS THE FRAME

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:40.150
It's all him down here.

00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.218
FULL OF JUNG KOOKS

00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:42.453
[Jung Kook] So annoying.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.090
Just wait, I'm editing right now.

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:47.591
JUNG KOOK PLOTTING REVENGE

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:48.992
-[English] Hello.
-We're fans.

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:50.127
ARMY RECOGNIZED THE TWO

00:53:50.194 --> 00:53:52.062
-[in English] Really? Thank you.
-Jimin.

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:56.366
LOL

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.602
[in Korean] Nice one.

00:53:58.669 --> 00:53:59.970
We have to show this.

00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:01.939
This one deserves to be revealed.

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.208
-Gotta admit, it's well made.
-[in Korean] Right?

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.143
This isn't a photo, it's art.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.211
ARTIST JEON

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.880
Out there, do you see that duck?

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.782
Zooming in.

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:13.584
Closer, closer, closer.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.587
SELF-RELEASED PHOTO

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.956
This is fun. Why is this so fun?

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:25.095
THE ARTIST IS ALSO VERY PLEASED

00:54:25.896 --> 00:54:28.031
-While Junsoo is not here...
-Sweet potato.

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.566
STAFF'S FOOD CAME OUT FIRST

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.338
TWO FRIES THIEVES

00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:38.008
MEERKAT MODE

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:41.011
MEERKAT MODE #2

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:47.684
We couldn't spend much,

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:50.454
so we just ordered one fries.

00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:51.955
RIGHT THEN, THEIR FOOD ARRIVES.

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:53.023
-Hello, friends.
-Wow.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.391
[in Korean] This is no joke.

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.926
That should make the single one.

00:54:55.993 --> 00:54:57.461
All good. Thank you very much.

00:54:58.362 --> 00:54:59.963
-Jung Kook, let's share this.
-Yes.

BEEF SHRIMP SINGLE BURGER

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:03.467
[Jung Kook] Look at this, look at this.

00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:04.535
Perfect. Let's eat.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.303
Let's dig in, Jimin.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:07.538
[Jimin] That's huge.

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:09.473
Put the fork in.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.542
PRECISE CHOREO AIMED AT THE BURGER

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:12.609
I'm nervous.

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:13.944
The juice...

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:15.779
GIGANTIC SIZE

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:17.047
Like this...

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:20.851
CUT AND BITE RIGHT AWAY

00:55:24.855 --> 00:55:25.856
Is it good?

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:28.792
JUNG KOOK TAKES A BITE TOO

00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:29.860
EXCLAIMING

00:55:29.927 --> 00:55:31.261
This is good.

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.831
-So good.
-Yes.

00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:36.867
JIMIN EATS

00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:40.304
THEN JUNG KOOK EATS

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.973
TRUE-TELLING EYEBROWS

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.308
It's crazy good.

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.912
WHAT'S WITH THAT FACE?

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.648
IT'S SO DELICIOUS
AGREED

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:54.351
A SHOUTOUT TO THE STAFF WHO RECOMMENDED IT

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:55.853
I love coleslaw.

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:58.422
UNEXPECTED BURGER CHOREO CONTINUES

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:01.825

A BITE OF SWEET POTATO FRIES

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.965
HOW TO MAKE YOUR BURGER
TASTE EVEN BETTER: ADD SAUCE

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.902
JUNG KOOK LIKES TO TRY DIFFERENT COMBOS

00:56:11.969 --> 00:56:14.805
JIMIN USUALLY STICKS TO ONE THING

00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:17.574
THE BURGER PURIST

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:24.348
HALF A BURGER GONE IN SECONDS

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.183
NOW SIDE DISHES ONLY

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:27.251
This is insane.

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:28.785
-It's really good.
-So good.

00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:31.889
Dip this in ketchup...

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:34.858
EXCLAIMING

00:56:34.925 --> 00:56:35.926
And...

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.661
Together?

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.730
SWEET POTATO FRIES
+ FRENCH FRIES + KETCHUP

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:42.399
EXCLAIMING

00:56:42.466 --> 00:56:45.369
I don't think I can finish it.

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:46.503
It's too much for me.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.305
I can.

00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:49.640
Maybe one more bite?

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.076
I'LL FINISH IT ALL

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.114
It's just so good.

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.883
But yesterday's meal was touching.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.652
PORK BELLY &amp; RAMEN

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:04.121
-Yes.
-We each had one and a half servings.

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:06.456
I thought it might be too much.

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:09.226
-Nope. Yeah.
-But we finished everything.

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:13.397
WE EAT PRETTY WELL, ACTUALLY

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:16.066
-Huh?
-What?

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:17.234
Gone already?

00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:18.335
ONE LAST BITE LEFT

00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:19.469
I told you.

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:23.240
THE FINAL BITE

00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:25.842

[in Korean] Can you see this?

00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:43.527
This is the cocoa spread.

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.029
-I don't eat sweets.
-The famous one.

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:47.731
That's crazy.

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:50.167
EXCITEMENT OVERLOAD

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:51.702
Should I cut it?

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:55.105
ECSTASY

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.308
EXTREME SWEETNESS

00:57:58.375 --> 00:57:59.743
You have a sweet tooth.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.313
SINCE IT'S SWEET LIKE CRAZY,
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER BITE

00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:06.083
TINGLING

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.251
[Jung Kook] It's the peak of sweetness.

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:12.022
CONQUERING THE CHOCOLATE

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:15.525
Since it's sweet, I can still eat more.

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:17.327
That was pure bliss.

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:19.463
I'll recommend one to you.

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.565
I think you'll like this one.

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:22.666
-Raspberry?
-Yeah.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.801
I'm going crazy.

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:27.738
Like checking the beef juices
after grilling.

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.339
INSPECTING THE RASPBERRY JUICE

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:30.974
Thank you, Jimin.

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:32.809
[inaudible]

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.046
TASTING RASPBERRY DONUT

00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:38.148
Mmm.

00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:41.184
LASTLY, PISTACHIO DONUT

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:48.358
SAVORING

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:51.862
[Jimin] Is it good? Should I try one?

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:55.365
JIMIN TASTES THE DONUT TOO

00:58:55.432 --> 00:58:57.100
I think I'm obsessed with sweets.

00:58:57.167 --> 00:58:58.168
TREMBLING

00:58:58.235 --> 00:59:01.605
LOSING HIS MIND IN ANOTHER WAY

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:02.773
It's too sweet.

00:59:03.807 --> 00:59:05.308
I love it.

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.843
How much do you think it is?

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.712
Let's ask them to total it up.

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:13.884
PAYMENT COMPLETE
58 FRANCS, ABOUT 100,000 WON

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.018
This is nice.

00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:16.353
SUGAR SPIKE

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.788

-Yep.
-That was a good meal.

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:31.301
It really was.

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:32.736
Should we cross?

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:34.071
GOING TO WALK IT OFF

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:35.639
Where are we going?

00:59:36.173 --> 00:59:37.340
This tree right here.

00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:41.845
ARRIVED UNDER THE NEARBY TREE SHADE

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:44.815
KOREAN TRAIT: ALWAYS GROAN
WHEN SITTING DOWN

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:47.084
This is nice. Such a vibe.

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:51.922
PEOPLE ARE OUT TO ENJOY THE AFTERNOON SUN

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.390
AND THE DUCKS HAVE ARRIVED TOO

00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:54.458
What? There are ducks.

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:56.293
Here they come.

00:59:59.296 --> 01:00:01.498
-Pretending to give food?
-Yeah.

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:07.137
A DUCK SLOWLY APPROACHING

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.638
Want some?

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:09.706
EXPECTING

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.375
DUCK JUST PASSES BY

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.478

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.646
REAL DUCK FEED HANDED OVER

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.981

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.483
-Let me have some too.
-Okay.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.017
THIS TIME, FOR REAL

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.086
I guess they know.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.423
[quacking]

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:29.693
Is it good?

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:31.928
Is it good?

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.396
Good duck.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.664
Let's play a game.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:35.732
Sit.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.168
Sit.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.236
WHY ME...?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.004
Only this one eats.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.239
I want you to eat.

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:45.175
Hey, pig. Why are you eating everything?

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:46.510
Uh-oh!

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:47.978
Do rock-paper-scissors.

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.747
JUST GIVE IT TO ME!

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.048
[Jimin] I got nothing.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:54.417
I'll just pretend.

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.353
FOOLED

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.256
FOOLED #2

So cute.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:06.997
Can I pet you?

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:11.034
I'll feed them, try petting.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.537
FAILED

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.339
What are you saying?

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.041
"I wanna eat too."

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:22.045
TRANSLATING DUCK LANGUAGE

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:25.182
WORLD'S FIRST DUCK INNER-THOUGHTS DUBBING

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.483

"Thank you for the food."

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:29.920
You want some?

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.454
A HEALING TIME WITH THE DUCKS

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.223
They don't eat the crumbs.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.892
That's it, nothing left now.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.662
LEAVING COOLLY

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.830

NEXT GUESTS: THE SPARROWS

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.105
You heard the rumor, didn't you?

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.307
WE HEARD THE RUMORS

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.342
You don't want it?

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:55.779
It's really good.

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:56.846
SPARROW FEEDING

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.092
Where to now?

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.462
GOING ON THEIR WAY

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.031
So cool in here.

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:16.967
Ah!

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:19.436
[singing] Let's go.

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:20.870
-[Jimin] Good to go?
-Yeah.

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.407
[Jung Kook] It'll be so much fun.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:25.842
What, the jumping one?

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:26.943
Yeah.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.912
SHAKING HIS HEAD

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:31.915
I wasn't that excited yesterday.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.150
-I got sleepy after the meal.
-Yeah.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.385
So, want to jump today?

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:36.453
MAXIMUM ENERGY

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:37.721
How can I make it funny?

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.122
-In a funny way.
-No idea.

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:40.323
Oh, funny?

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.426
-Yeah.
-Want to fall funny?

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.494
Yeah.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:47.264
AS EXPECTED FROM MY FEARLESS BROTHER...

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:52.969
FILLING THEIR EYES WITH THE SCENERY

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:58.008
DRIVING FORWARD, FULL OF EXCITEMENT

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.312
ARRIVED AT THE GEAR STATION FIRST

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.780
[Jimin] We can just park here?

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.081
WHERE ARE THEY?

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.716
They must be over there. There.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.754
A VERY, VERY TALL MOUNTAIN...

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.255
Oh, it is.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.291
That's high. Nope, not for me.

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.458
I'll wait here.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.760
I'll just come with you.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.628
I honestly can't do it.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:19.863
WHAT MAKES JIMIN TREMBLE?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.435
HEIGHT: 90 METERS

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.805
MAX SPEED: 120 KM/H

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:32.309
A THRILLING FREEFALL
BETWEEN THE CLIFFS OF GRINDELWALD

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:39.349
SIMILAR TO BUNGEE JUMPING
BUT SWINGS LIKE A GIANT SWING

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:42.185
HOLD UP!
A SPECIAL GAME FOR JIMIN

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:44.054
RULE: JUNG KOOK JUMPS FIRST

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.357
IF HE GETS THE KEYWORD RIGHT,
THE STAFF JUMPS INSTEAD

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:49.759
PLEASE, JUNG KOOK...!

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.330
JUNG KOOK PUTTING ON THE GEAR

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.165
SAFELY

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.966
CAREFULLY

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:59.402
SAFETY EQUIPMENT: ALL SET

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:00.570
[in English] Let's go.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.939
[in Korean] Should I take a big flight?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.075
-Jimin.
-Yes?

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.577
-You see that car?
-Yes.

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:08.878
-The one in front?
-Yes.

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.080
Just follow that car.

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:11.981
MUST DRIVE TO THE JUMPING POINT

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.650
-Here we go.
-Okay.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.085
ON THE WAY TO DROP HIM OFF

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:18.555
[Jung Kook in English] Let's go.
[in Korean] Time to ride that swing.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.956
[in English] Let's go.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.492
HEADING TO THE CANYON SWING

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:24.594
Jimin doesn't want to.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:28.064
Jung Kook, you have to win the game

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:29.766
-Yes.
-so I don't have to do it.

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.434
I'm counting on you.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.470
What if I don't look?

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:34.771
If you don't,

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:36.473
I'll jump without a rope.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.574
AGGRESSIVE DUE TO FEAR

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.942
As if you actually would.

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.779
We could ride a bike here.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.281
The road up here's nice.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.550
FEELING NERVOUS,
BUT THE SCENERY IS A WORK OF ART

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:51.087
It's so peaceful,
but it's the way to suffering, huh?

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.155
Exactly.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.256
AT THE JUMP ZONE

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.025
[Jimin] This must be it.
Looks like where they stop the car.

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:58.294
[Jung Kook] Shall we go?

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:02.065
PARTICIPANT, PLEASE STEP OUT

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.836
Go.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:07.971
VERY EXCITED

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:10.707
The air's great. And lots of bugs.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:13.209
The director looks hilarious wearing that.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.912
-Huh? Jung Kook, you're wearing it too.
-Yeah.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:19.215
Jung Kook has to win the game
so this doesn't end up on me.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.650
It doesn't even fit you.

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.852
The director's wearing the big one.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.521
LOOK AT THIS GUY...

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.257
Of course, I do believe

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.427
-you will win the game for me,
-But...

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.862
but my heart just won't stop pounding.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.664
I'm a man, after all.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.466
My heart's pounding.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:40.904
AS THEY WALK HEARING
THE SOUND OF THEIR HEARTBEAT...

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.173
-We're almost here.
-It's over there.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.974
I just saw someone drop.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:48.244
WELCOME, FIRST TIME DOING CANYON SWING?

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.547
You know what I think?

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:55.985
You can just take it slow
and enjoy the view.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:57.487
Why fall so fast?

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.024
Why do people do that?

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:05.295
Why on earth do they enjoy speed?

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.896
I'm getting nervous too now.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.698
NERVOUSNESS BUILDING IN REAL TIME

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:10.200
I'm starting to feel it.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.671
I'm suddenly getting nervous too.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.272
So, you get nervous too?

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.174
-Of course.
-Oh, really?

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.276
If you don't get nervous for falling...

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.678
I thought you had no fear.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:23.646
Nope, my heart's racing too.

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.582
-Yours too?
-Yeah.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.816
That's surprising.

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:30.753
EXCITEMENT + ANTICIPATION

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.691
[continues humming]

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.693
Jimin, please say hi.

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:38.895
Me?

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:41.898
Your nose...

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:55.845
WARNING: OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS
MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.615
Why do people even do this?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.251
Why... who even invented this?

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.788
If I'd joined the special forces
or something,

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:08.024
maybe I'd do it easily.

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:09.225
APPEALING TO HIS EMOTION

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:13.630
HIS EYES ARE GETTING TEARY

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.066
HOLDING TIGHTLY

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:20.036
REALLY TERRIFIED...

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:21.771
"I should watch Bon Voyage."

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:22.906
This reminds me.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.542
"I should watch Bon Voyage."

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.679
This time, please say
something to me before you jump.

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:33.049
Jimin, did you eat?

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.117
Nice.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.287
-Jung Kook, get ready.
-Okay.

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.354
JUNG KOOK'S TURN

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.623
I don't think I can even see the word.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.724
Where is it?

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.694
They're holding it down there.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.932
CAN YOU SPOT WHERE THE KEYWORD IS...?

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.900
I don't see anyone holding it.

01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:52.802
They're holding the paper there.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.504
-That one?
-Yeah.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.606
What if I don't get it right?

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:58.608
Then I'm going back to Korea.

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:00.543
Should we do a practice round?

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.111
-Practice?
-You want?

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:03.413
Rock, paper, scissors.

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.480
Minus one.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.815
HE LOSES EVEN THIS ONE

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.550
I can't do this.

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.319
I haven't won a single round.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.123
JUNG KOOK, MY BROTHER, I'M COUNTING ON YOU

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.159
CALMLY PREPARING FOR HIS FALL

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:18.227
Wow.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.264
SO FAR DOWN BELOW

01:08:21.364 --> 01:08:22.732
Are you ready?

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.133
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.069
Say something to me before you go.

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:27.203
[in English] I'm ready.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.905
-[in Korean] Are you filming?
-Yeah.

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.708
-[in English] Ready. Yeah.
-Good?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.843
Three, two, one.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.678
-Jump!
-[in Korean] Jimin, did you eat?

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:39.582
[whoops, exclaims]

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:44.354
JEON JUNG KOOK TAKES OFF

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.425
FRONT SHOT OF JUNG KOOK FREE-FALLING

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:55.298
A PERFECT SWING

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:59.335
[exclaiming softly]

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:03.539
[exclaiming]

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.509
I didn't even see that.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.111
SO THRILLED THAT HE FORGOT...

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:12.749
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO SEE IT NOW

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:15.918
Ilchi-woljang.

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.220
Ilchi-woljang.

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:21.658
LET'S CHECK THE CORRECT ANSWER

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:24.961
THE KEYWORD
FOUR CLEAR LETTERS IN VIEW

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.429
Ilchi-woljang.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.797
I got it.

01:09:27.864 --> 01:09:32.101
FEELING MIGHTY PROUD

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:36.172
AFTER THAT ELECTRIFYING FULL SWING...

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:37.774
That was fun.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.375
Can I go one more time?

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:43.579
Ilchi-woljang.

01:09:44.347 --> 01:09:45.348
Ilchi-woljang.

01:09:46.983 --> 01:09:50.186
[cheering]

01:09:50.253 --> 01:09:57.160
MY BROTHER'S AWESOME

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.461
Now you, huh?

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.096
[in English] No.

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:02.932
[in Korean] What do you mean?

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:04.400
Let's go!

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.805
JUNG KOOK GOES DOWN TO LAND

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:10.640
[groaning]

01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:19.048
FEELING PROUD

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:24.987
SAFELY BACK ON THE GROUND

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.290
Ilchi-woljang.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.358
-Yeah, buddy, that was dope.
-[English] Yeah!

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.426
GOOD JOB, BRO

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:33.229
WHAT WAS THE KEYWORD?

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:34.630
[in Korean] I saw it.

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.766
-[crew member] What is it?
-Ilchi-woljang.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:37.834
-Right?
-Correct.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.901
Correct!

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.003
I should've gotten it wrong.

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:43.906
THE STAFF JUMPS INSTEAD

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.577
THE ENDING: JUNG KOOK WINS

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:49.212
I'm nervous.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.348
UNAWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BELOW,
JIMIN RUNS OFF

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:55.084
I want to do it again.

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:56.219
Can I?

01:10:56.853 --> 01:11:00.356
JIMIN GOES TO GREET(?) JUNG KOOK

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:02.859
-[crew] He's coming back up?
-Yeah.

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:05.995
I knew it.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:08.598
I knew this would happen.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:14.036
Well, I was the one who said
Jung Kook should do it, after all.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:18.674
Now, I'll look up where we should go
in Switzerland.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.679
[director] We booked the place
you looked up before, Jimin.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.251
I knew he'd get excited,
and he really did.

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.186
That was fun, it really was.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:31.254
THE HERO APPEARS

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.955
I knew I wouldn't end up jumping.

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:35.024
I'm happy.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:39.028
Usually in shows like this,

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:43.065
they say "I'm not jumping"
then jump anyway.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.534
That's so cliché, right?

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.303
I say I'm not jumping, and I really don't.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.739
I'M REALLY NOT JUMPING

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:50.807
Oh.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.743
The weather's great.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.645
Jung Kook's coming back up, right?

01:11:57.847 --> 01:11:59.182
Is he on his way now?

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.185
Nice.

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.352
-Huh?
-It feels good.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:07.623
WAITING FOR JUNG KOOK

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:11.627
JUNG KOOK PASSES BY~

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.630
WHY DOES HE JUST PASS BY...?

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.599
-[crew member] They just passed by.
-What?

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:21.671
LEFT ALONE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.372
Why did I wait?

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.408
ANGRY

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:26.642
I waited for him,

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:30.713
and I came to tell him
I'd be at the finish line.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.215
But he went right past me?

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.317
Seriously.

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:38.821
If that's how it is,
I'm going home. Goodness.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.958
-What?
-Oh, Jimin was waiting?

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.860
We should tell him to come back up.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.130
Let's go. Can someone guide me
to the landing spot?

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:50.266
Where did you say?

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:54.370
JIMIN'S LOCATION IS RELAYED TO JUNG KOOK

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:57.673
I'll jump one more time

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.442
and come down.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:01.911
This...

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.547
You can't ride just once.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:10.386
THE CANYON SWING THAT
BRINGS SMILES ALL AROUND

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:14.690
This is so fun. Let's hurry.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:17.026
LOOKS SO EXCITED EVEN FROM BEHIND

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.896
So excited.

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.831
So excited.

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:25.201
Where, where?

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:27.503
Where is it?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.508
QUICKLY ARRIVING AT THE JUMP PLATFORM

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.314
[in English] ♪ One more time ♪

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.720
Back again.

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:49.158
-[man] You liked it?
-Yeah, really liked it, yeah.

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:50.393
Best thing ever?

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.061
Maybe?

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:53.796
"Maybe." [laughs]

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:59.902
THIS TIME, JIMIN WAITS AT THE LANDING SITE

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.138
That breeze feels amazing.

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.508
HE SEES JIMIN

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.276
[in Korean] He's there now.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.516
JIMIN

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:20.623
-[man] Are you okay?
-[in English] Yeah.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.392
-Are you ready again?
-Yes.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.561
PREPARING FOR THE SECOND CANYON SWING

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.698
JIMIN'S ALSO READY TO FILM

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.032
BACK ON THE JUMP PLATFORM

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.301
Come to the edge.
You're gonna jump high, yeah?

01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:33.402
Uh-huh.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.438
FEELING A BIT SCARED ONCE HE'S UP THERE

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.673
-So higher this way, yeah?
-Okay. Yeah.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.241
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready!

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:43.012
-Three, two, one.
-Two, one.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.550
ANOTHER FLAWLESS JUMP

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.721
[screaming]

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:52.855
[man] Jump!

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:56.459
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.795
THRILLING

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:05.568
SWINGING THROUGH THE CANYON,
FEELING NATURE'S GRANDEUR ONCE AGAIN

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:08.104
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL MEMORY MADE

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:10.406
Whoa!

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:13.476
[Jung Kook yelling in delight]

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.247
[in Korean] That was fun.

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:19.782
That was a fail.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.652
Jimin.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.995
[sighs]

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:34.430
Fail.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.564
FAILED THE COOL LANDING

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.099
Failed to make it look cool.

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:39.502
There.

01:15:41.437 --> 01:15:42.438
Ah.

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:48.310
HEART

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.212
CAPTURED JUNG KOOK'S HEART

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:53.149
ZOOMING IN ON JUNG KOOK

01:15:56.619 --> 01:16:01.490
LET'S HEAD DOWN NOW

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:03.692
Jimin.

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:09.365
HEAVE-HO, HEAVE-HO

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:13.102
HE COMES BACK SAFELY THIS TIME AS WELL

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.339
A JOYFUL HIGH-FIVE

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.142
-I'll show you a funny video later.
-What is it?

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.911
-Want to see it now?
-Yeah.

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:25.548
-I filmed a video of you, Jung Kook.
-Okay.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.117
[screaming]

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.088
It switched to selfie mode.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:35.224
I didn't even notice that.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.893
I was like,
"What? Why'd it turn into a selfie?"

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.730
You dummy.

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.203
MY BRAVE LITTLE BROTHER WAS AMAZING...

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.804
These two were recording.

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:51.107
AFTER FINISHING THE CANYON SWING

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.441
One, two, three.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:53.509
CAMERA FIRST

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:54.710
Can we go?

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.345
Yes, you may go.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.315
Let's go.

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:00.382
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.251
[Jimin] I knew you'd love this.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.221
Let's pull over here.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.624
STOPPING BRIEFLY ON THE NARROW ROAD
FOR ONCOMING CARS

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:09.892
Oh!

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:11.994
What a nice young man.

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:16.232
[in English] Let's go.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.366
[Jung Kook] Great.

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:19.101
[in Korean] You want some music?

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.570
-Sure.
-Got a song you want to hear?

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.872
Me?

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.540
AN UNEXPECTED CHOICE...

01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:26.041
EMOTIONAL

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.515
GROANING

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.416
It suddenly feels depressing.

01:17:35.551 --> 01:17:38.187
Doesn't it make you want to go home
and drink soju?

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:44.326
PARK AND JEON FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE IN THE MOVIE, LUCKED OUT

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:49.298
QUICKLY CHANGING THE MOOD

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:50.366
HESITATES

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:51.433
Listen.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.335
You know...

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:55.838
Maybe a video message?

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.106
Sure.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.842
-To whom?
-Me?

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.110
To Bam?

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.578
Bam?

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:05.281
-To Bam.
-Bam, it's me.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:06.515
Oh!

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:10.319
-How are you?
-This music makes it too sad.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.089
Since you've been sick so often lately,

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.460
I haven't been able
to take care of you well.

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.197
I'm sorry for being so lacking.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:24.166
ONLY WHAT HE COULDN'T DO FOR HIM
COMES TO MIND

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:25.568
It breaks my heart.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.005
Seeing that you're doing well there,

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.107
I feel relieved,

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.611
and I just hope you're happy.

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:40.115
I'll go see you
as soon as I'm back in Korea.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.250
I WILL GO VISIT BAM

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.354
I'll say a few words to Ddosun.

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:47.623
Hope you're doing well. Ddosun?

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:51.260
Ddosun, how's life up there
in puppy heaven?

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:55.998
I really...

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:59.868
[singing]

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:07.109
DDOSUN STILL HAS A PLACE DEEP IN HIS HEART

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.180
I loved you.

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.615
I miss you, Ddosun.

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:17.219
-My family raised her when I was five.
-I see.

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:18.287
[clicks tongue]

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.323
I cried so much when she left.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.092
Kind of like Gureum.

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:24.693
HE CRIED A LOT THAT DAY

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.630
[singing]

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:36.305
BEING IN SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE MAKES THEM
THINK OF THEIR FURRY FRIENDS EVEN MORE

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:43.646
THEY WISH ONLY HEALTH
AND HAPPINESS FOR THEM

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:50.819
MAY THEIR HEARTS REACH
THEIR BELOVED FRIENDS...

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.388
[Jung Kook] Let's park.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.455
NEAR THE LODGE

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:56.258
Nice, right?

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.459
Awesome.

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.194
-Thank you for the ride.
-Sure.

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:01.363
There's no place to pull over.

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:04.199
No, no, on the way here.

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.501
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.935
On your way,

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:09.138
-if you see a pretty spot,
-Yeah.

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:11.040
-you can just pull over.
-Okay.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:14.243
Let's see if there's a nice place
on the way.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.311
Okay.

01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:17.413
Somewhere totally random?

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.415
READY TO PARK IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.849
Here? In the middle?

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.051
Here?

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.221
We really think the same way.

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.289
Here?

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.325
Great. Here?

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.693
Circling the roundabout?

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:34.930
We're doomed. Let's go.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.131
Nowhere to stop.

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.533
What a shame.

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.535
[director] Shall we go
grab some ice cream?

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.036
Sounds good. On foot?

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.173
My bag.

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.374
Is it in the back?

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:46.809
Down there? My bag.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.444
-In front.
-Front?

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.845
Ice cream.

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:51.013
WALKING TO GET ICE CREAM

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.548
[sighs]

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:57.019
If the sunlight were a little less strong,

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.221
that'd be perfect.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.223
It's so hot.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.658
HE FEELS AS HOT

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:04.159
The light's coming from behind.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.496
-That kid...
-He's using a stick.

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.531
[Jung Kook] He probably
thinks he's rowing.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.166
So cute.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.702
HI

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:15.904
HI #2

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.841
The kid's mom waved hello.

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.914
A PEACEFUL TOWN
THAT NATURALLY BRINGS SMILES

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:26.982
So cute.

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:31.153
Oh, wait.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.221
What?

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.522
What's with the sun?

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:34.790
THE SUNLIGHT'S TOO STRONG

01:21:34.857 --> 01:21:36.358
It hurts so much.

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:37.626
My outfit makes it hotter.

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:42.164
But I don't want to wear short sleeves.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.967
I just want to dive into some cool water.

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.568
-Into the water?
-Yeah.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.604
You'd get the worst sunburn ever.

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.671
Totally.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.373
My goodness.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.509
JUST AS THE HEAT
STARTS TO WEAR THEM OUT...

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.177
Where is it? Here?

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.612
ARRIVED AT THE SHOP

01:21:56.678 --> 01:22:00.783
ORDERING ICE CREAM WITHOUT HESITATION

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.151
[in English] Cone ice cream.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.685
Cone? Yes.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.053
Chocolate and vanilla.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.722
JIMIN ORDERS CHOCOLATE &amp; VANILLA

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:07.856

LARGE SIZE ICE CREAM: 4.70 FRANCS

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.194
70 FRANCS?

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:13.729
Oh, 4.70 francs.

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:14.897
[in Korean] Getting one?

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.098
-Yeah.
-Different one?

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:18.901
Mango?

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:20.436
Oh.

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:21.570
[in English] Thank you.

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:23.972
[man] Mango, in the cone?

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.341
[in English] Mango and strawberry.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.510
JUNG KOOK ORDERS
MANGO &amp; STRAWBERRY IN A CUP

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:30.779
-[in Korean] Is it good?
-Wow.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:34.283
SHARING MAKES IT TASTE EVEN BETTER

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:36.485
PURE BLISS

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:37.553
Here you go.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.687

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.956

JUNG KOOK TASTES

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:49.231
THUMBS UP

01:22:49.932 --> 01:22:52.067
-Here.
-Thank you very much.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.836
ICE CREAM PURCHASE COMPLETE

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.972
TIME TO DIG IN

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:58.607
ONE BITE OF STRAWBERRY

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:00.776
ONE BITE OF MANGO

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.612
-[in Korean] Ah! Want to try?
-[in Korean] Is it good?

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.414
No, I'm good.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:07.549
Do you see it melting already?

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:10.018
Look, it started melting
the moment we bought it.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.453
That's how hot it is.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.655
But once it hits dawn, it gets freezing.

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:15.324
NOM

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:18.360
ADVANCED SKILL: EATING FROM THE BOTTOM

01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:21.396
Won't it fall?

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.398
CALLED IT

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:24.666
[sighs]

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.335
It's melting too fast.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:30.072
PROBLEM SOLVED BY EATING

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:31.673
FINISHING IT UP ON A BENCH

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.208
It never disappoints.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:34.810
Strawberry-mango.

01:23:34.877 --> 01:23:36.778
Is that even a usual combo?

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.881
It could be. I bet it is.

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.249
They go so well.

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:41.984
JUNG KOOK CLEARS HIS TOO

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.919
Strawberry and mango, unbeatable.

01:23:44.887 --> 01:23:48.657
TAKING A SHORT BREAK

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.459
[crew member] I'm wiped.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.494
You should jump in the water.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.230
You've got everything ready?

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:57.332
All the conditions are met now.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.569
It'd feel amazing to jump in right now.

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:03.305
If I had a rash guard and slippers,
I'd go in.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.275
I don't have slippers. I'm in socks
and shoes, how would I?

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:07.910
MAKING EXCUSES NOT TO GO IN

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.645
So all you need is slippers?

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.113
Oh, boy.

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:12.548
WHY BOTHER

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:15.450
Well, sure.

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:16.652
IF YOU WISH...

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.253
AWKWARD LAUGH

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.089
No pants? Oh, there they are.

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:22.824
Let's go and jump in.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.459
Huh? Not me.

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.895
I didn't ask for this.

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:28.130
A DISASTER HE MADE...

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.698
Hold on.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:30.766
Oh, come on.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.467
GETTING READY TO WEAR SLIPPERS

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:36.305
Why did you even bother bringing these?

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:38.807
Seriously.

01:24:38.874 --> 01:24:40.008
OFF TO GET CHANGED

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:41.209
Oh boy...

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.681
WAITING PATIENTLY...

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.517
JUNG KOOK COMES OUT IN A RASH GUARD

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:49.918
This is why...

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.754
people should watch

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:54.823
what they say.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.293
You gotta think before you talk.

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.666
Why did you have to bring it up?

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:07.636
Are you sure?!

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:11.673
Are you sure?

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.609
[groans]

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.611
Check the water temperature first.

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:16.778
[Jimin] Jung Kook again.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:19.448
Why me? How did I end up like this?

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.317
I didn't think
they'd actually go get them.

01:25:22.384 --> 01:25:25.053
-They really ran to get it.
-How did this start again?

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.922
Oh, I said it'd be nice to go in.

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:29.825
-Yeah, you did.
-Well, that was from earlier.

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:34.196
A GRACEFUL SWAN APPEARS,
GLIDING ACROSS THE LAKE

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:36.531
Jung Kook, can you catch it?
Dinner's that swan.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.000
-Swan meat?
-Swan meat.

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.067
Swan meat!

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.969
[Jimin chuckles]

01:25:41.036 --> 01:25:43.672
AT THE WORD "SWAN MEAT,"
THE BIRD CHANGE COURSE

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.607
-Go catch it.
-Okay, I'm going.

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:47.109
-Yeah.
-Here I go.

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.410
But I think it's strong.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:51.613
If it pecks you,
it might crack your head open.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.982
I'll just grab its beak
and twist its neck.

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:58.420
THE SWAN SUDDENLY CHARGES
RIGHT AFTER HE SAYS THAT

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:00.022
[Jimin] It came so close.

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:02.824
-Why did you come?
-[Jung Kook] Why?

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.259
[Jimin] It's really come.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:07.262
SWAN RUSHES TOWARD JUNG KOOK

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:11.099
PANICKING

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.001
TRIES TO MAKE PEACE

01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:14.136
PEACE REJECTED

01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:16.938
[all laughing]

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.106
A FACE-OFF WITH IT

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:19.975
This is absolutely absurd.

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:22.377
What, what do you want?

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.780
I think it's asking for food.

01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:27.983
THE SWAN KEEPS APPROACHING

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:32.354
BACKING AWAY AFTER ALL THAT BRAVADO...

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:33.422
Wait...

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:37.559
ATTACK INITIATED

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.128
AH!
(=GO AWAY!)

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:42.564
-Go.
-It wants your autograph.

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:43.632
GO ON, SHOO!

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.467
A STRANGE STANDOFF

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.002
[Jimin] Asking for an autograph.

01:26:47.069 --> 01:26:48.837
What's your name?

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.305
[in English] What's your name?

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.341
[in Korean] What? There's no food.

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.543
Stop it.

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:55.811
Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.413
[Jimin laughing] This is ridiculous.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.282
THE SWAN LEAVES EMPTY-HANDED

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.750
It's walking away like that.

01:27:01.817 --> 01:27:03.051
Looks kind of upset.

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:04.386
Yeah, totally.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:05.921
[Jung Kook] Bye.

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:08.490
[Jimin] That's hilarious. So funny.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:11.560
It was way over there
and suddenly came straight at me.

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:12.661
COMEDY GODS ADORE HIM

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:13.962
It must've been terrified.

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:17.099
Hey, it's because you mentioned swan meat.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:18.900
Hey, I spared your life.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:22.504
If it had come a bit closer,
I would've taken it on.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:23.805
A BLUFFING COWARD

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.340
[Jimin] Now the swan's sulking.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.676
Look, it's pouting all the way over there.

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:29.578
-Hey, come back.
-[Jimin chuckles]

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.247
When it came charging at me,
I freaked out.

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.484
Hey, hey, hey.

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.085
ATTRACTED BY GOOD REACTIONS

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:38.620
[Jimin] These ones are fine.

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:41.490
Hey, these guys are okay.

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.158
[Jung Kook] Man, today I've...

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:44.326
eaten well,

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:47.095
hit the sauna, done everything.

01:27:47.162 --> 01:27:50.532
COME ON, LET'S GO

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:54.002
The way you backpedaled was hilarious.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:55.904
I'm telling you, that was scary.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:57.873
I couldn't help it.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.875
We got the perfect shot.

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.712
NOW JIMIN'S GETTING READY TO SWIM TOO

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:05.814
CHANGED INTO HIS RASH GUARD

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.983
That swan was so funny.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.050
There it is again.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.486
THE SCENE-STEALER STILL HOVERING NEARBY

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:14.055
Maybe I should precool a little here.

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:15.423
[groaning]

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.195
No wonder I lost my voice.

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.165
I want to get good at swimming.

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:26.434
I need to learn survival swimming,
like breaststroke.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.103
SPOTS A PAIR OF SLIPPERS

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:29.437
Think these will float?

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:32.307
Maybe?

01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:38.680
USING SLIPPERS INSTEAD OF KICKBOARDS

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:45.353
JIMIN TRIES SWIMMING ALONE IN THE LAKE

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.324
[exclaims] There's a rock.

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:50.392
THANK GOD

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.927
Go back.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:56.064
SAFELY RETURNS TO SHORE

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:58.466
I think this actually helps, Jung Kook.

01:28:58.533 --> 01:28:59.968
Really? Does it float?

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:04.873
I'll follow you. These help.

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:08.910
JUNG KOOK HEADS INTO THE LAKE

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:10.145
You can float?

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.546
You can even just walk.

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:13.315
There are rocks.

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:16.518
JIMIN WALKS AFTER HIM

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:19.120
I can't touch the ground.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.857
STRETCHING HIS LEGS TO THE MAX

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:23.959
Okay, okay.

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.827
[Jung Kook] There's a higher rock here.

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.429
Why are we so far apart?

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:28.496
FEELS FARTHER

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:30.131
Can two people stand there?

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.533
-No.
-No?

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.437
If you hold half a breath in your lungs...

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:39.774
SPLASHING

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.376
How does he float so well?

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:42.444
NATURAL FLOATERS

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.246
We look like we're floating.

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:45.947
Like this...

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:47.515
Look like we're swimming?

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:49.517
Looks like we're good?

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.052
Like we're swimming?

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.220
LOOKS CONVINCING

01:29:52.287 --> 01:29:54.890
Without these,
we really look like swimming.

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:56.424
I can't do this without them.

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.759
They really work.

01:29:57.826 --> 01:29:58.960
SLIPPER-KICKBOARD

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:00.028
They work great.

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.634
-Not bad, huh?
-Huh?

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:08.603
You're kidding.

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:11.907
DID JUNG KOOK JUST FALL IN?

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:15.744
FLAILING

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.913
-No?
-No, it's just...

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.581
I am swimming fine, but...

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:22.517
DUN-DUN

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:23.585
FOR THIS SHOT

01:30:23.652 --> 01:30:25.320
[Jimin] You liar.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.256
Wait a sec.

01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:30.091
-There's the big one.
-Jung Kook.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.861
Jung Kook.

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:36.798
SLIPPER SEPARATION

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:38.633
Jung Kook, my slipper.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.268
[exclaims]

01:30:40.335 --> 01:30:45.473
SWIFT RESCUE OPERATION

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:50.445
MISSION: SAVE THE SLIPPER

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:52.647
Okay, I'll show you my way out.

01:30:52.714 --> 01:30:53.782
Going in one go.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:02.824
REACHES SHORE IN ONE GO
THANKS TO THE SLIPPER KICKBOARD

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:10.165
Anyone who can't swim,
get one of these. It's the best.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.533
Can really swim with it.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.702
JUNG KOOK RETURNS

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:14.769
Shall we go?

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.005
Why did we even start this?

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:18.373
Nah, I had fun.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.075
Me too. I'm just freezing.

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.609
-It's cold.
-Wait.

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:22.744
Let's grab our stuff.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:24.312
Wait, we have stuff?

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:26.381
NEVER FORGETS TO TAKE HIS STUFF

01:31:26.448 --> 01:31:27.983
HEADING BACK TO THE LODGE

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:29.384
LAUGHING

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.654
SUDDENLY HIT BY A LAUGHTER VIRUS

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:40.128
ONE LAUGH, AND THEY CAN'T STOP...

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:41.229
Doctor Strange.

01:31:41.296 --> 01:31:42.330
Blue cape.

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:45.033
NOW THEY'RE PLAYING DOCTOR STRANGE

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:49.804
Dormammu...

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:53.408
RANDOM ATTACK TO HIS CHIN

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.781
THE DOCTOR STRANGE BIT IS STILL GOING...

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:02.751
I think we passed our lodge.

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:04.586
[crew member] You passed it.

01:32:06.054 --> 01:32:07.122
Where is it?

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.424
WAIT... WHERE IS OUR HOUSE AGAIN?

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:11.659
THE REAL LODGE ENTRANCE

01:32:14.763 --> 01:32:19.868
END OF THE WILD, CHAOTIC FREE TIME!

01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:23.438
[Jimin] Today, I'll do all the cooking.

01:32:23.505 --> 01:32:25.473
BUT IT'S ALREADY LOOKING SHAKY...

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.375
I don't know how to cut a zucchini.

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:30.578
It doesn't seem cooked at all.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.580
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN'T DO

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:34.015
Okay, go on in.

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:35.884
I'll brown it nicely.

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:38.720
STEPS SLOWLY APPROACHING

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:40.789
-Get back in there.
-Can I taste it?

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:43.291
I don't think I have any talent
for cooking.

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:44.592
My first time ever cooking.

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:45.660
