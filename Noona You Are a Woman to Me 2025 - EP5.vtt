WEBVTT

00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:08.873
(For the first time, Sang Hyeon asked to talk to Bon Hee.)

00:00:09.913 --> 00:00:12.682
(I felt sorry about it,)

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.253
(so I asked you to talk in private.)

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:18.653
(I wanted to have a date with you today.)

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.752
(I was just as grateful...)

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.993
(as the courage he showed me.)

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.092
(And because of it,)

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:26.763
(I wanted to know more about him.)

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:30.103
(Preference-based date, What's In My Bag)

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:32.563
(The older women chose their date according to the men's belongings.)

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.073
(I'll pick this one.)

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:38.943
(Yeong Gyeong chose, hoping it was Sang Hyeon.)

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:42.473
(Ji Won chose, thinking it was Ji Yung.)

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:44.683
I'll choose solely based on the items in the bag.

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.013
(Ye Eun chose, hoping it was Sang Won.)

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.482
(All the other items in that bag didn't look like Mu Jin's,)

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.583
(but I was certain about the lip balm.)

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:54.823
(So, I was really torn before I picked that.)

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:57.592
(Hoping it was Mu Jin's,)

00:00:57.593 --> 00:00:59.763
(she chose the khaki-colored bag.)

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.432
(The older women hope the younger men they have in mind...)

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:03.963
(get in their cars.)

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:08.233
(Sang Hyeon, whom Yeong Gyeong dearly hoped for)

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.973
(As she hoped, he was her match!)

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:14.513
(I hope it's Ji Yung.)

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:16.582
(However, after that,)

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:19.543
(all the guesses were off.)

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:22.712
(The one who chose Mu Jin's bag...)

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:26.153
(was Ye Eun, not Bon Hee.)

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.353
(Bummed out)

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:30.762
(The owner of the bag Bon Hee chose...)

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:33.163
(was Ji Yung.)

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.363
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.103
(I was so surprised.)

00:01:39.403 --> 00:01:41.503
(I thought it was good.)

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:46.813
(The feeling of excitement from the unexpected encounter)

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.783
(The successfully predicted date of Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon)

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:52.412
(Sang Hyeon's younger-man moment...)

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:53.813
(of finding fine dining awkward)

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.713
(Joking)

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:00.193
(That was cute.)

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:04.593
(The unexpected match date of Ji Won and Hyeon Jun)

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:06.733
(Hyeon Jun, look.)

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.202
(I know you.)

00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:11.203
How do you know me?

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:12.602
(I once asked...)

00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:14.473
(for your number.)

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:19.172
(Ji Won had asked for Hyeon Jun's number at the gym.)

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.372
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- It is.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:26.183
(What will happen to the two who have already met?)

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:28.752
All right, with every episode,

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:30.753
the relationships are getting more and more complicated.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.783
We were taken aback too,

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:34.222
but Ji Won...

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:35.722
(Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:37.923
- She made a shocking statement.
- Yes.

00:02:38.263 --> 00:02:39.993
It's an honesty...

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.162
that's rare to see on a dating reality show.

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:43.462
- True.
- Whether...

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.232
- You're right.
- that will help...

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.803
or harm the relationship...

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:50.742
is something to watch for.

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:53.212
Yes, and Mu Jin, Bon Hee, and Sang Hyeon...

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:54.742
are in a love triangle.

00:02:54.743 --> 00:02:56.043
- That's right.
- Yes.

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:58.082
It seemed like Yeong Gyeong...

00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:00.282
became interested in Sang Hyeon after the date.

00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:03.052
I know, right? Things are constantly twisting and turning,

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:04.583
and they'll only get messier with time.

00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:06.123
This seems like just the beginning.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:07.593
Exactly.

00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:10.992
(What's In My Bag Date: Ye Eun and Mu Jin)

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:13.062
It's my first time in Bukchon.

00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:14.963
- Really?
- It's my first time ever here.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:18.863
The two look good together.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.833
- I'm starving.
- Same here.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.543
(The date course prepared by Ye Eun)

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.272
(A modern yet traditional Korean dining)

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:29.472
What a pretty place.

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:30.982
(A modern yet traditional Korean dining)

00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:32.043
You're right.

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:33.783
That's so pretty.

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:36.653
(Looking around)

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:38.482
(Smiling)

00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:39.893
How did you find this place?

00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:42.793
I searched like crazy online.

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:45.193
You found a nice one.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.693
- I love places like these.
- You do?

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.063
Do you?

00:03:51.603 --> 00:03:52.763
I do too.

00:03:57.073 --> 00:03:59.343
(Feeling proud)

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.482
(Fusion Korean menu that Ye Eun chose)

00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:07.613
It's beautiful.

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:09.683
Cheers.

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:17.323
(Groaning)

00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:20.693
(Impressed)

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.393
It's good.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:24.933
(How cute.)

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:27.273
- Dig in.
- Enjoy.

00:04:30.243 --> 00:04:31.303
(Stopping)

00:04:32.173 --> 00:04:33.643
- It's too big.
- It's huge.

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:35.543
(Glancing)

00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:39.113
I won't look.

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.453
That's witty of him. "I won't look."

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.352
I'm kind of shocked.

00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:46.922
- How heart-fluttering.
- Just don't look.

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:48.452
There's no need to say it.

00:04:48.453 --> 00:04:50.323
(I know, right?)

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:53.023
I won't look.

00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:54.392
(Eating)

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.533
But it's really too big.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:59.332
Cut it into pieces.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.333
(Mu Jin looks away on purpose.)

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:06.103
(She eats it whole, thanks to Mu Jin being thoughtful.)

00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:12.212
(Amazed)

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:13.283
It's really good.

00:05:15.053 --> 00:05:16.253
- Is it?
- Yes.

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:20.653
Are you fine with a used fork?

00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:25.063
(Mu Jin helps Ye Eun to some food.)

00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:27.463
What was your ideal type again?

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:30.333
My ideal type?

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:32.903
Appearance-wise?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.373
Both.

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:39.073
Appearance-wise, I remember saying I liked someone pretty.

00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:42.173
What do you mean by pretty? Be more specific.

00:05:42.573 --> 00:05:43.582
Specific?

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.543
(Laughing)

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.913
I'm not sure. I guess it's just...

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:50.953
the feeling I get.

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:55.893
Are you the aggressive type or not?

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:57.292
- Me?
- Yes.

00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:58.423
(Laughing)

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.833
(Thinking)

00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:04.803
If I'm certain,

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:07.103
I become very aggressive.

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:11.173
Isn't being aggressive good?

00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:13.973
Did you ask if being aggressive is good?

00:06:14.313 --> 00:06:15.873
I like aggressive people.

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:17.912
(Laughing)

00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:20.053
(Exclaiming)

00:06:22.513 --> 00:06:23.723
How long do you get to know people?

00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:25.523
When dating someone?

00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:29.123
I don't drag it out too long.

00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:33.062
The first impression...

00:06:33.063 --> 00:06:35.633
and the feeling I get are quite powerful.

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:41.232
It doesn't really take that long for me to build it into a relationship.

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.773
(Mu Jin instantly makes a move when it feels right.)

00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:46.373
I've always wanted to talk to you.

00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:50.243
Earlier, as I said in the car,

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.113
I had...

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:54.683
this feeling.

00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:56.413
What kind of feeling?

00:06:58.983 --> 00:07:01.552
(Eyes eager for an answer)

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:04.062
(Flustered)

00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:05.622
I just wanted to talk to you...

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:07.263
when I got the chance.

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:09.862
(I see.)

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:10.863
Little did I...

00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:13.033
expect us to go on a date today.

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.072
It was either the 1st or 2nd day.

00:07:16.073 --> 00:07:17.943
I received a video,

00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:21.573
and it looked like it was...

00:07:22.673 --> 00:07:24.083
from you.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.312
Maybe not.

00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:26.712
(Embarrassed)

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.283
He's got the wrong person.

00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:30.422
(Out of the 2 Love QR Codes...)

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:31.683
(Mu Jin received on the first day)

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:35.592
(Believing that the one from Ji Won was from Ye Eun)

00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:37.323
But do you know what that means?

00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:40.092
Because he's interested in her,

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.093
Is he flattering himself?

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:44.133
Mu Jin wishes Ye Eun had sent it.

00:07:45.563 --> 00:07:47.402
"I wonder who sent this."

00:07:47.403 --> 00:07:49.272
"I know who one is from, but not the other."

00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:50.672
At times like that, you think of...

00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:52.642
- the person you're interested in.
- Yes.

00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:53.643
- That's likely.
- Right?

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:55.612
He has this little hope inside him.

00:07:55.613 --> 00:07:56.912
(Mu Jin's guess based on his hope?)

00:07:56.913 --> 00:07:59.483
And he unconsciously thought of her.

00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:01.352
He didn't deduce it.

00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:03.452
That girl just popped into his head.

00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:05.382
Because he wants it to be that person.

00:08:05.383 --> 00:08:07.852
Yes. Instinctively thinking of her means...

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:09.023
he's interested in her.

00:08:09.293 --> 00:08:10.293
And since day one.

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:11.563
(That's possible.)

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:13.993
In that position...

00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:17.362
And it felt like we made eye contact a few times.

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.103
- So I wondered if it was you.
- See?

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.533
Their eyes met.

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:22.473
I can't tell you.

00:08:22.673 --> 00:08:24.942
- Is it a secret?
- Ye Eun is slightly taken aback.

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.702
- Totally.
- We had to make it so that...

00:08:26.703 --> 00:08:27.843
it wasn't obvious.

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:30.513
We made sure the videos were hard to guess.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.283
Is it a forever secret?

00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:35.213
Yes. After all, I can't tell you.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.153
She dodged it well.

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:40.822
(Laughing)

00:08:40.823 --> 00:08:41.853
(I see.)

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.493
The girls guessed based on the bags.

00:08:47.063 --> 00:08:48.993
I'm curious. How did it go?

00:08:50.403 --> 00:08:52.432
Who do you think the girls thought...

00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:53.933
your bag belonged to?

00:08:54.303 --> 00:08:55.502
Did they think it was me?

00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:56.672
- No.
- Not at all?

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:57.743
Not a single bit.

00:08:58.543 --> 00:08:59.743
Who did you think it belonged to?

00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:00.973
Your bag...

00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:05.983
Sang Won.

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:07.413
- Sang Won?
- Yes.

00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:09.453
(Disappointed)

00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:12.723
Thinking it was Sang Won's,

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.592
- She had Sang Won in mind.
- I chose it.

00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:16.123
(Exclaiming)

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:20.393
And the khaki-colored bag.

00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:23.063
- They thought that was mine?
- Yes.

00:09:23.503 --> 00:09:25.863
(Thinking)

00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:30.443
We thought that bag belonged to you.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.373
- So that was what happened.
- Yes.

00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.142
Oh, no.

00:09:34.143 --> 00:09:37.383
(Mu Jin realizes he wasn't Ye Eun's 1st choice.)

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:43.453
- It's now our third day here.
- Yes.

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:48.593
Have your feelings...

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:50.792
for a guy grown?

00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:53.393
Do you have feelings for someone?

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.462
(Thinking hard)

00:09:55.463 --> 00:09:57.403
(Contemplating)

00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:01.873
Rather than a guy my feelings have grown for,

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:06.742
I do have someone I'm interested in.

00:10:06.743 --> 00:10:08.272
Since she mentioned Sang Won earlier,

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:10.142
wouldn't he immediately think it's Sang Won?

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:11.143
(I see.)

00:10:12.843 --> 00:10:16.583
Have your feelings for someone grown?

00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:18.283
I'm talking about you.

00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:22.553
Somewhat.

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:28.593
I was surprised. We're only on day three.

00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:32.633
But to think that my feelings could grow so much.

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.533
- To even...
- I can tell.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:37.842
(Laughing)

00:10:37.843 --> 00:10:40.103
You can? Is it obvious?

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.213
It's very obvious.

00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:45.713
Come on. Is it that obvious?

00:10:46.953 --> 00:10:49.983
(Embarrassed)

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.153
To drive the point home like that?

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.053
That's practically drawing a line.

00:10:54.123 --> 00:10:58.062
When Ye Eun and Mu Jin had just set off earlier,

00:10:58.063 --> 00:11:01.092
she mentioned Mu Jin was one of the guys...

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.293
she was interested in.

00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:07.833
At first, the guys I wanted to talk to...

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:10.343
(You were one of them.)

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:14.613
Someone I was drawn to among the guys.

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:15.842
She even said that.

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:18.783
There were moments they could've hit it off.

00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:20.483
But, out of the blue,

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.212
Mu Jin confessed how surprised he was at the depth...

00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:25.023
of his feelings in just three days.

00:11:25.623 --> 00:11:27.952
In short, he's saying, "I only have eyes..."

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.122
"for her."

00:11:29.123 --> 00:11:30.223
- It's cool.
- Yes.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:32.222
- He's really cool.
- Right?

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:33.663
- It's cool, but...
- No, it's not cool.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:35.532
We are polar opposites.

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:36.863
- I hate it.
- Honestly,

00:11:37.003 --> 00:11:39.232
Ye Eun kept showing her interest...

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:40.972
- in Mu Jin.
- Right.

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:42.732
- But Mu Jin already clearly has...
- True.

00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:44.073
someone in his heart.

00:11:44.373 --> 00:11:46.242
If he were to go with the flow...

00:11:46.243 --> 00:11:48.112
and talk as if he feels the same,

00:11:48.113 --> 00:11:49.712
- I'm worried about...
- Same.

00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:50.843
how badly Ye Eun would get hurt in the future.

00:11:50.913 --> 00:11:52.442
- That's why I think...
- I agree.

00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:53.682
it's a good idea to make it clear...

00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:55.982
that his feelings are set in stone.

00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.022
(I think so too.)

00:11:57.023 --> 00:11:58.123
That's the cool part.

00:12:03.593 --> 00:12:05.923
Did you think you'd go all-in...

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:09.092
if you found someone interesting...

00:12:09.093 --> 00:12:10.363
after moving into Yeon House?

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.433
I think I did.

00:12:13.603 --> 00:12:15.073
First impressions...

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:18.503
play a big role for me.

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:20.043
First impressions...

00:12:21.843 --> 00:12:25.113
mean a great deal to me and strongly affect me.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:31.623
(Mu Jin answers that first impressions are crucial.)

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:34.393
It seems like it.

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:37.663
I guess our timings were off.

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:40.632
Had my first date...

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:42.533
been with Mu Jin,

00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:47.133
things might've been different.

00:12:48.003 --> 00:12:49.833
But that wasn't the case.

00:12:50.173 --> 00:12:52.073
Oh, no.

00:12:52.943 --> 00:12:55.843
(Did the two have bad timing?)

00:12:57.883 --> 00:12:59.342
I love the interior design of this place.

00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:00.913
(What's In My Bag Date: Bon Hee and Ji Yung)

00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:03.753
- Thank you.
- Here.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.852
Earlier, I saw two pairs of sunglasses in your bag.

00:13:08.853 --> 00:13:09.853
Yes.

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:12.793
One was tinted orange.

00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:18.162
(A pair of orange sunglasses came out of Ji Yung's bag.)

00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:19.263
It must be Mu Jin's bag.

00:13:19.663 --> 00:13:20.832
- Really?
- Do you think so?

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.372
(Bewildered)

00:13:22.373 --> 00:13:25.642
The weird gut feeling I had at first was right.

00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:28.413
Mu Jin wouldn't wear orange-tinted sunglasses.

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:31.342
I wear it before getting in a car.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.343
(The real owner of the sunglasses)

00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:35.452
(Embarrassed)

00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:36.483
Does it not suit me?

00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:39.422
It's just that the orange color is very bright.

00:13:39.423 --> 00:13:40.553
Yes, it's bright orange.

00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:42.193
It blocks everything.

00:13:42.193 --> 00:13:43.193
(She can't feed a line.)

00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:44.623
- So it's functional.
- Yes.

00:13:44.893 --> 00:13:46.392
- Pardon me.
- That was fast.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:48.093
(The dish is ready just in time.)

00:13:48.263 --> 00:13:49.832
(Amazed)

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.163
It looks delicious.

00:13:51.633 --> 00:13:52.932
This looks incredible.

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.403
- Where is that?
- That looks good.

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:56.303
- Enjoy.
- You too.

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:58.043
Is the meat not too big?

00:13:58.343 --> 00:13:59.643
No, it's okay.

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:01.843
I like my meat big.

00:14:02.143 --> 00:14:03.843
Meat is best in big pieces.

00:14:04.113 --> 00:14:05.113
You're right.

00:14:05.113 --> 00:14:06.113
(Eating)

00:14:06.114 --> 00:14:08.313
(Ji Yung eats a big piece of meat.)

00:14:09.313 --> 00:14:10.522
It does look good.

00:14:10.523 --> 00:14:11.523
(Bon Hee does too.)

00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:13.052
(Satisfied)

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:16.593
(The two have similar appetites.)

00:14:17.163 --> 00:14:18.692
Do you like watching movies?

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:20.793
Yes, I'm a big fan of movies.

00:14:20.863 --> 00:14:22.592
What genres do you like?

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:25.933
I'm not picky when it comes to genres.

00:14:27.063 --> 00:14:30.473
But my favorites would be about F1. Do you know "Top Gun?"

00:14:30.773 --> 00:14:32.902
- The "Mission: Impossible" series?
- Exactly.

00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:34.373
I love such series.

00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:37.283
- Can you also watch "Mad Max?" - It's one of my favorites.

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:39.642
I've watched a lot of animations.

00:14:39.643 --> 00:14:41.312
- Studio Ghibli.
- Studio Ghibli.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.583
I watched a lot of it.

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:45.123
I love "Howl's Moving Castle."

00:14:45.323 --> 00:14:46.822
Me too. "Spirited Away..."

00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:48.223
- and "Howl's Moving Castle." - Yes.

00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:50.692
Studio Ghibli's animations...

00:14:50.693 --> 00:14:52.793
- It has its own vibe, no?
- That vibe is...

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:55.833
Nice. The two can keep a conversation going.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.433
In "Spirited Away,"

00:15:00.403 --> 00:15:02.272
- the parents turn into pigs.
- Yes, they do.

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:03.632
- Isn't that scene so sad...
- Right.

00:15:03.633 --> 00:15:04.673
if you really get into it?

00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:07.713
- This is bad. He doesn't get it.
- Yes.

00:15:09.873 --> 00:15:11.243
I hadn't thought that far.

00:15:11.743 --> 00:15:14.013
That scene never struck me as sad.

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:17.183
(They have similar tastes but different tearjerking points.)

00:15:17.323 --> 00:15:18.582
- Come on.
- He should have agreed with her.

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:21.193
How would Mu Jin have answered that question?

00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:22.753
"It's a secret."

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:27.293
- "It's a secret." - Why do you keep imitating Mu Jin?

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:28.633
I won't look.

00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:30.162
"I won't look."

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.202
"It's a secret."

00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:32.232
- "I won't look." - "I won't look."

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:33.233
The two are furious.

00:15:33.234 --> 00:15:35.373
- I won't watch "Spirited Away." - I won't.

00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:37.033
(That's hilarious.)

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:39.343
What do you want to do the most with your boyfriend?"

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.113
And I mean together.

00:15:42.343 --> 00:15:43.982
Something like this. Getting a meal together,

00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:45.612
drinking coffee,

00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:46.983
and going on trips.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.822
(Thinking)

00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:53.753
Yesterday, you said you spend a long time getting to know a guy.

00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:55.853
If you were to find...

00:15:56.553 --> 00:15:58.093
a decent guy within a week,

00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:02.833
are you willing to date him? That's what I'd like to know.

00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:04.363
(Exclaiming)

00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:06.103
- I am.
- You are?

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.373
Later on...

00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:09.573
So in short...

00:16:09.673 --> 00:16:11.002
- Oh, dear. He's flustered.
- Gosh.

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:13.643
I did some thinking.

00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:17.313
I thought it was too short,

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.682
but it's actually tightly packed.

00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:20.342
We're together all the time.

00:16:20.343 --> 00:16:21.513
True.

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:24.022
It's a tightly packed time, the same as keeping in touch...

00:16:24.023 --> 00:16:25.522
for 2 to 3 months.

00:16:25.523 --> 00:16:26.983
You're right about that. For real.

00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:32.692
That was why, at first, I wondered...

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:36.063
if things could work out, if my feelings would grow, and such.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:41.903
Now, I think it's possible.

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:44.943
The two are feeling the same way.

00:16:47.913 --> 00:16:50.783
I was very grateful to Ji Yung back then.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.713
Ji Yung must've felt it.

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.052
I mentioned someone else...

00:16:56.053 --> 00:16:59.123
and expressed my feelings in a roundabout way...

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:02.123
so that he'd feel it indirectly.

00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:06.293
He's quick-witted and has a good hunch.

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:08.492
I'm sure he asked more questions...

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:10.803
out of consideration.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:13.402
The chat itself was relaxing.

00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:16.003
He kept putting me at ease in a comfortable way.

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:18.972
It seems Bon Hee...

00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:21.242
- has feelings for Mu Jin.
- For sure.

00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:24.743
But last night, Sang Hyeon made a sudden confession.

00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:28.412
I'm sure that must've stirred Bon Hee's feelings.

00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:31.753
So she must not be in any position to also consider Ji Yung.

00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:33.123
Right.

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:37.923
(At Yeon House in the meantime)

00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:46.102
- Is he asleep?
- He's sleeping?

00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:47.402
He's not thinking?

00:17:47.403 --> 00:17:48.403
(Doubting what they see)

00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:49.972
Is he asleep?

00:17:49.973 --> 00:17:51.572
He's even snoring.

00:17:51.573 --> 00:17:53.172
(Sang Won is snoring in his sleep.)

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.913
This isn't the time for that.

00:17:56.613 --> 00:17:58.813
(Tossing)

00:18:08.423 --> 00:18:09.952
(Half asleep)

00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:11.023
He's thinking again.

00:18:13.763 --> 00:18:16.733
(I think I've been asleep for quite a while.)

00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:20.632
(Time goes slower for him.)

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:21.903
Stop sleeping. Get up now.

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:23.703
Poor him.

00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:30.173
(The outfit he chose for a date)

00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:32.913
But it's not like he wasn't chosen.

00:18:33.483 --> 00:18:34.912
He doesn't have to be so depressed.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:37.282
Why do such things only happen to Sang Won?

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.853
Getting zero votes and not being chosen.

00:18:42.753 --> 00:18:44.092
I think he's going somewhere.

00:18:44.093 --> 00:18:45.623
(Sang Won feels stuffy and leaves the house.)

00:18:46.163 --> 00:18:51.103
(Where is he headed?)

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:53.602
(A grocery store?)

00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:56.533
He probably didn't like the ingredients in the house.

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:02.143
I was all by myself, and I got depressed.

00:19:02.743 --> 00:19:04.142
- Then, - He was depressed.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.243
I remembered from the night before...

00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:09.113
that everyone was hungry when they returned.

00:19:09.213 --> 00:19:11.452
I had confidently told other participants...

00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:14.053
that I could make great suyuk, so I decided to make that.

00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:16.892
Good.

00:19:16.893 --> 00:19:18.492
(Buying suyuk ingredients for those outside)

00:19:18.493 --> 00:19:20.592
He's really handsome, though.

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.133
- Right.
- He really is.

00:19:24.503 --> 00:19:26.233
(Thinking)

00:19:26.703 --> 00:19:29.332
(Looking around)

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:31.443
What does he want to do? What is he looking for?

00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:35.643
Sir, are those all the wasabi products you have?

00:19:36.373 --> 00:19:37.412
- What?
- Wasabi?

00:19:37.413 --> 00:19:38.783
(Does that mean...)

00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:40.343
Why is he getting wasabi?

00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:42.483
Ye Eun said she liked it.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:49.393
(Ye Eun said she liked wasabi on the previous date.)

00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:53.263
Sir, are those all the wasabi products you have?

00:19:53.723 --> 00:19:55.032
It's for Ye Eun?

00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:59.503
(Is he buying wasabi for Ye Eun?)

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:03.833
(While Sang Won is picking wasabi...)

00:20:08.943 --> 00:20:11.512
- Wait. It's a new girl.
- Finally.

00:20:11.513 --> 00:20:15.153
(Someone walks toward Yeon House.)

00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:25.163
While everyone's gone?

00:20:32.657 --> 00:20:34.167
While everyone's gone?

00:20:37.797 --> 00:20:42.006
(A new woman quietly comes to empty Yeon House.)

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.637
She's already beautiful from the side.

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:45.876
(They can't wait to find out...)

00:20:45.877 --> 00:20:49.307
(who the fifth girl is.)

00:20:51.847 --> 00:20:52.847
So cool.

00:20:55.617 --> 00:20:56.756
She's tall.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:58.616
(The fifth woman...)

00:20:58.617 --> 00:21:02.287
(naturally walks around the yard.)

00:21:02.757 --> 00:21:06.927
(Go So Hyun)

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.527
She's pretty.

00:21:08.627 --> 00:21:09.897
(Amazed)

00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:11.667
She's pretty.

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.706
(Surprised)

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.606
- But...
- I know her!

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.607
- What?
- What?

00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:19.576
- You know her?
- Yes.

00:21:19.577 --> 00:21:21.947
- Are you serious?
- This is amazing!

00:21:24.677 --> 00:21:26.117
I saw how my close friends...

00:21:26.217 --> 00:21:30.587
found their partners and relied on them.

00:21:30.787 --> 00:21:34.186
When I asked them to set me up with someone,

00:21:34.187 --> 00:21:36.796
they said they didn't know who they should introduce to me,

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.757
and time kept passing.

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:42.927
When I ask them now, there's no one.

00:21:43.027 --> 00:21:45.567
Men of my age are mostly married...

00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:46.867
or already have children.

00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:50.037
I want to eat together,

00:21:50.437 --> 00:21:53.777
share what we love, and laugh together.

00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:58.076
I wish I also had someone whose life and mine...

00:21:58.077 --> 00:22:01.416
create synergy as we spent time together.

00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:02.417
(The last newcomer of Yeon House)

00:22:04.787 --> 00:22:11.057
(She checks the Love QR as soon as she arrives.)

00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:14.466
(Her QR code...)

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:17.166
(leads to the information of the younger men.)

00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:18.566
Because she's the only one who doesn't know.

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:19.736
"In the food and beverage industry."

00:22:19.737 --> 00:22:21.236
- "A database administrator." - They should tell her.

00:22:21.237 --> 00:22:22.406
Naturally.

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.477
"Government employee."

00:22:24.237 --> 00:22:25.737
"Dermatologist."

00:22:27.277 --> 00:22:31.316
The ones I'm interested in are Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin.

00:22:31.317 --> 00:22:33.547
Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin.

00:22:34.217 --> 00:22:35.487
But Mu Jin is taken.

00:22:35.747 --> 00:22:37.256
Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin?

00:22:37.257 --> 00:22:39.117
Not Mu Jin, though.

00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:41.527
- Mu Jin...
- Oh, no.

00:22:42.687 --> 00:22:43.857
I'm so excited.

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:53.807
(The last older woman enters Yeon House.)

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:58.877
It's a big house.

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:02.607
Is anyone here?

00:23:04.347 --> 00:23:06.916
When the older women enter...

00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:08.317
- They're composed.
- Right?

00:23:12.957 --> 00:23:14.957
(Excited and nervous)

00:23:16.657 --> 00:23:20.027
(Sang Won returns from the grocery store.)

00:23:20.397 --> 00:23:21.466
(Very excited)

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:23.197
- He's here.
- Right on time.

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:25.766
The one I worry about the most!

00:23:25.767 --> 00:23:28.736
Now, they can go on a date.

00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:30.436
What if he's so surprised that he tumbles?

00:23:30.437 --> 00:23:32.177
(Being mean for no reason)

00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:35.846
(Without a clue,)

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:40.017
(he goes to the house.)

00:23:40.817 --> 00:23:44.287
(So Hyun waits for other people.)

00:23:57.697 --> 00:23:58.797
It's their first encounter.

00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:00.567
He's here.

00:24:06.607 --> 00:24:08.377
He doesn't know!

00:24:09.177 --> 00:24:10.447
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

00:24:11.877 --> 00:24:13.446
(Surprised)

00:24:13.447 --> 00:24:15.047
Did you just arrive?

00:24:17.087 --> 00:24:19.587
Yes, I'm new. Hi.

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:23.057
Oh, no.

00:24:23.827 --> 00:24:25.997
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:24:26.697 --> 00:24:30.337
Give me a second. I'll put these down first.

00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:32.067
Just a second.

00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:33.766
(Walking by)

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:34.837
Oh, my gosh.

00:24:34.937 --> 00:24:36.107
(Peeking)

00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:37.577
He's peeking.

00:24:40.807 --> 00:24:42.647
(Awkward)

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:50.017
(Surprised Sang Won flees to the kitchen for now.)

00:24:54.557 --> 00:24:57.057
(Nervous)

00:24:58.957 --> 00:25:02.627
(Restless)

00:25:02.997 --> 00:25:05.897
(Peeking)

00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:10.877
(He tries to calm down as he puts the groceries away.)

00:25:11.407 --> 00:25:15.847
(So Hyun keeps feeling out of place.)

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:21.217
(He soothes himself with a cup of cold water.)

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.357
(Awkward and anxious)

00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:29.987
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:32.356
Good luck, Sang Won.

00:25:32.357 --> 00:25:34.327
- Look at him.
- He's so glad.

00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:35.427
Did you...

00:25:36.197 --> 00:25:37.567
(His eyes open widely.)

00:25:38.867 --> 00:25:42.007
(Staring)

00:25:44.407 --> 00:25:47.647
I was sitting next to her,

00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:50.477
and she was my type.

00:25:54.117 --> 00:25:55.846
No way!

00:25:55.847 --> 00:25:56.887
(Amazed)

00:25:57.757 --> 00:25:58.757
No way!

00:25:59.717 --> 00:26:01.286
(Who were we worried about?)

00:26:01.287 --> 00:26:02.686
- This is so tiring, SOOBIN.
- He's so..

00:26:02.687 --> 00:26:04.597
- He's really simple.
- I'm so tired of him.

00:26:04.927 --> 00:26:06.497
- Awesome.
- It's so...

00:26:06.797 --> 00:26:08.927
We didn't have to worry about him.

00:26:09.227 --> 00:26:12.197
He loves and gets hurt, then he loves and gets hurt.

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.607
I think that's the charm of a younger man.

00:26:15.137 --> 00:26:16.537
He's my type.

00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:18.176
He's so transparent.

00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:20.677
Oh, my gosh. Please don't hurt his feelings.

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:24.247
I was sitting next to her,

00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:26.647
and she was my type.

00:26:28.747 --> 00:26:30.957
(Checking his looks)

00:26:31.287 --> 00:26:33.317
(Inhaling sharply)

00:26:36.487 --> 00:26:38.097
While you were waiting by yourself,

00:26:38.457 --> 00:26:39.596
weren't you nervous?

00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:43.027
I didn't know what to do.

00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:46.397
I just sat here, not doing anything.

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.677
I'm glad, though. I wasn't sure what I should do by myself.

00:26:51.607 --> 00:26:53.576
I prefer being with you,

00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:54.847
even though it can be a little awkward.

00:26:55.077 --> 00:26:56.877
I thought I had to put the groceries away by myself.

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:01.617
A new male participant arrived yesterday.

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:04.056
- Last night. The new one.
- The new one?

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:05.117
Yes.

00:27:05.217 --> 00:27:07.956
We found out about each other's jobs for the first time.

00:27:07.957 --> 00:27:09.256
(He tells her what happened...)

00:27:09.257 --> 00:27:10.827
(to help her adjust better.)

00:27:10.997 --> 00:27:12.727
- What's your name?
- Go So Hyun.

00:27:13.497 --> 00:27:14.626
- So Hyun?
- Yes.

00:27:14.627 --> 00:27:15.797
(I see.)

00:27:16.867 --> 00:27:18.167
You're Sang Won, right?

00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:19.367
(His eyes shake.)

00:27:19.368 --> 00:27:20.766
- Yes.
- I checked...

00:27:20.767 --> 00:27:22.867
- the QR code on the rooftop.
- Oh, I see.

00:27:23.367 --> 00:27:25.207
I memorized your name.

00:27:26.637 --> 00:27:27.646
(Grinning)

00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:28.847
Please keep remembering.

00:27:29.207 --> 00:27:30.207
What?

00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:32.516
Please say that while looking into her eyes.

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:34.587
(He can't even make eye contact.)

00:27:34.947 --> 00:27:36.956
- The aesthetic clinic...
- Yes, I'm a dermatologist.

00:27:36.957 --> 00:27:38.857
- A dermatologist?
- The type that you know.

00:27:39.687 --> 00:27:40.857
- A dermatologist?
- Yes.

00:27:41.087 --> 00:27:42.487
- Really?
- That's right.

00:27:42.957 --> 00:27:44.427
He should tell her that he's the director.

00:27:45.357 --> 00:27:46.697
I wonder what you do.

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:48.667
Me? Do you have any guesses?

00:27:50.597 --> 00:27:51.597
(Inhaling sharply)

00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:52.937
(Looking)

00:27:53.737 --> 00:27:55.837
(Staring)

00:27:56.507 --> 00:27:58.137
(Shy)

00:27:58.237 --> 00:28:00.077
- You have such great skin.
- Me?

00:28:00.237 --> 00:28:02.277
- I can tell.
- I'm wearing makeup.

00:28:03.547 --> 00:28:04.616
(Laughing awkwardly)

00:28:04.617 --> 00:28:06.146
- He's so in love.
- Oh, no.

00:28:06.147 --> 00:28:07.416
This is so sweet.

00:28:07.417 --> 00:28:09.186
(Feeling shy)

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.886
I feel like you're a model.

00:28:10.887 --> 00:28:13.117
- You're tall, right?
- I'm not that tall.

00:28:13.217 --> 00:28:15.057
- You're not?
- I'm 168cm.

00:28:15.557 --> 00:28:17.796
- That's tall.
- Is it?

00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:19.327
That's a tall height.

00:28:19.627 --> 00:28:21.396
Isn't it the height that most women prefer?

00:28:21.397 --> 00:28:22.467
You mean 168cm?

00:28:22.497 --> 00:28:23.666
- It's the most...
- I guess so.

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:24.836
- You know.
- You're right.

00:28:24.837 --> 00:28:26.966
- You'd look good in everything...
- Right.

00:28:26.967 --> 00:28:29.607
- with that height.
- Yes.

00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:31.006
(Pleased)

00:28:31.007 --> 00:28:32.637
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:35.077
Right. Such compliments work.

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.346
(Feeling proud)

00:28:37.347 --> 00:28:40.387
I was all alone in the house earlier.

00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:43.886
And it was too hot at noon to work out.

00:28:43.887 --> 00:28:44.987
It was.

00:28:46.117 --> 00:28:47.386
Do you work out?

00:28:47.387 --> 00:28:48.687
Work out? I do.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:52.327
I liked playing soccer, so I played soccer.

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.566
Does he want to play soccer with her in the yard?

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:55.766
(Soccer?)

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.037
Do you drink?

00:28:57.197 --> 00:28:58.397
- Do I drink?
- Yes.

00:28:58.897 --> 00:29:00.637
I do, but...

00:29:01.007 --> 00:29:02.536
Korean, Chinese, and Western food.

00:29:02.537 --> 00:29:04.406
Among those, my favorite is Korean.

00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:05.637
Do you like Japanese food?

00:29:05.837 --> 00:29:08.107
What's your favorite food?

00:29:08.207 --> 00:29:09.507
Do you have a hobby?

00:29:09.677 --> 00:29:11.447
You were working before this, right?

00:29:12.447 --> 00:29:13.947
(Nodding)

00:29:14.287 --> 00:29:16.787
How deep does he want to dig?

00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:17.987
(Laughing)

00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:19.987
He's practically giving her medical treatment.

00:29:20.957 --> 00:29:21.987
I know, right?

00:29:22.287 --> 00:29:23.356
(Tired all of a sudden)

00:29:23.357 --> 00:29:25.497
The new woman does look tired.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.097
(Standing up)

00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:30.327
- I'll go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

00:29:31.297 --> 00:29:32.566
She's not running away from him, is she?

00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:34.906
She is. She's running.

00:29:34.907 --> 00:29:36.937
No, don't do that to Sang Won!

00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:38.807
(Sighing)

00:29:40.307 --> 00:29:42.607
(Sang Won is left alone once again.)

00:29:44.417 --> 00:29:45.647
At first...

00:29:46.347 --> 00:29:47.716
(Exclaiming)

00:29:47.717 --> 00:29:49.587
I thought, "There are ups and downs in life."

00:29:50.517 --> 00:29:52.386
I was depressed from buying groceries alone,

00:29:52.387 --> 00:29:54.127
and I was glad to get a second chance.

00:29:54.457 --> 00:29:55.926
But after talking to her, I wasn't sure...

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.097
if we were getting closer.

00:29:58.057 --> 00:30:00.027
I didn't know what to do.

00:30:00.327 --> 00:30:02.767
I didn't make great use of the opportunity,

00:30:03.267 --> 00:30:05.297
- so I regret it.
- That's too bad.

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:08.437
It's just... How should I put it?

00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:10.507
I could sense that he was kind.

00:30:11.277 --> 00:30:12.577
That's all we need to know.

00:30:13.307 --> 00:30:15.446
(He feels like he could have done better.)

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:16.577
Poor him.

00:30:18.847 --> 00:30:22.087
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun return from their date.)

00:30:22.917 --> 00:30:25.886
(Awkward)

00:30:25.887 --> 00:30:28.887
(Reading his face)

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:31.726
(During their date earlier)

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:33.767
I don't know if you remember,

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:36.427
but I...

00:30:37.237 --> 00:30:39.567
once asked for your number.

00:30:41.137 --> 00:30:42.166
(Realizing)

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:43.207
I did.

00:30:43.807 --> 00:30:47.307
I actually asked for your number.

00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:48.876
It didn't go so well at the time.

00:30:48.877 --> 00:30:50.616
(They met once again by chance...)

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:52.447
(after some time.)

00:30:52.817 --> 00:30:55.417
- Hi, everyone.
- Hello.

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:59.057
There was a tall guy.

00:30:59.417 --> 00:31:00.957
We made eye contact,

00:31:01.327 --> 00:31:03.186
and I thought,

00:31:03.187 --> 00:31:05.057
"How did we meet here?"

00:31:05.527 --> 00:31:08.997
I actually thought...

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:10.867
this was a prank.

00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:14.467
My heart still races, thinking about it now.

00:31:14.967 --> 00:31:16.367
I'm like, "How did this happen?"

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:18.237
"How should I..."

00:31:18.907 --> 00:31:20.576
"continue being here?"

00:31:20.577 --> 00:31:21.847
I thought about that a lot.

00:31:23.347 --> 00:31:26.117
His appearance was obviously...

00:31:26.447 --> 00:31:28.487
my type.

00:31:28.687 --> 00:31:30.987
But I had met him before.

00:31:32.217 --> 00:31:35.586
So, I couldn't send the code to say that I wanted...

00:31:35.587 --> 00:31:36.927
to talk to him.

00:31:37.427 --> 00:31:38.556
I was frustrated.

00:31:38.557 --> 00:31:42.867
That's why I couldn't exactly focus on getting to know others.

00:31:45.167 --> 00:31:49.437
(They got awkward after the date.)

00:31:54.947 --> 00:31:56.447
How are the reservations in September?

00:31:56.807 --> 00:31:58.047
- September?
- Yes.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.747
- The weekends are fully booked.
- Okay.

00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:04.987
But I blocked the reservations on weekdays because of this.

00:32:05.287 --> 00:32:06.686
On weekdays?

00:32:06.687 --> 00:32:09.957
I didn't want to be bothered while I was on the show.

00:32:11.097 --> 00:32:14.167
We chatted on the drive home,

00:32:14.297 --> 00:32:17.397
but none of it was about dating.

00:32:17.737 --> 00:32:19.397
We only talked about our businesses.

00:32:19.997 --> 00:32:22.367
- You were busy in August, right?
- Yes, I was very busy.

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.136
I was equally busy on weekdays and weekends.

00:32:25.137 --> 00:32:26.707
(They stick to the work topic.)

00:32:26.807 --> 00:32:28.407
I was surprised to see him...

00:32:29.077 --> 00:32:31.917
and couldn't believe what happened.

00:32:32.377 --> 00:32:33.717
But as we talked,

00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:39.387
I realized that he wasn't interested in me.

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.756
And I concluded...

00:32:41.757 --> 00:32:44.097
that he wasn't the one for me.

00:32:44.657 --> 00:32:48.297
I'll be able to focus on others more.

00:32:49.997 --> 00:32:52.737
- It's been fun.
- Yes, I had a lot of fun.

00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:57.706
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung are the first ones to return.)

00:32:57.707 --> 00:32:59.306
We talked so much.

00:32:59.307 --> 00:33:00.377
Totally.

00:33:00.577 --> 00:33:02.077
I feel much closer. Do you?

00:33:02.377 --> 00:33:05.647
(But Sang Won hasn't been able to feel closer to So Hyun.)

00:33:06.377 --> 00:33:07.487
You can go first.

00:33:10.387 --> 00:33:11.417
You can go first.

00:33:14.257 --> 00:33:15.427
Hi, there.

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:17.627
Just the two of you?

00:33:18.057 --> 00:33:19.227
I was here alone.

00:33:20.697 --> 00:33:21.927
We have a new participant.

00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:23.427
Seriously?

00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:25.066
Really?

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:26.837
- I was here all by myself.
- Here?

00:33:27.407 --> 00:33:29.437
When did the new one arrive?

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.336
I went shopping for groceries...

00:33:31.337 --> 00:33:33.336
and came back, thinking about making suyuk,

00:33:33.337 --> 00:33:35.076
but she was sitting there.

00:33:35.077 --> 00:33:36.207
So, I said hi.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.447
Really?

00:33:38.247 --> 00:33:40.347
Did you eat?

00:33:40.917 --> 00:33:42.546
- Not yet.
- Still?

00:33:42.547 --> 00:33:44.056
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

00:33:44.057 --> 00:33:47.086
I'd say it was a late lunch. It was lunch.

00:33:47.087 --> 00:33:48.757
- You ate as soon as you left.
- Yes.

00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:50.757
How did you spend your time?

00:33:50.897 --> 00:33:52.096
I just slept.

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:53.827
I literally slept. Then...

00:33:53.927 --> 00:33:55.267
Poor Sang Won.

00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.036
She's here.

00:33:58.037 --> 00:33:59.037
(Stopping)

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.467
Hello.

00:34:01.337 --> 00:34:02.607
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:34:02.637 --> 00:34:03.867
- Hello.
- He saw her.

00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:07.106
I'm a new participant.

00:34:07.107 --> 00:34:08.777
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:11.977
He's glad.

00:34:12.177 --> 00:34:14.147
- Ji Yung likes her.
- Look at Ji Yung.

00:34:15.417 --> 00:34:18.317
- We'll be right back.
- I know who you are.

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:24.197
(Bon Hee recognizes her?)

00:34:24.727 --> 00:34:26.397
(Bon Hee knows her?)

00:34:26.657 --> 00:34:28.527
The women know.

00:34:28.697 --> 00:34:30.197
- Tell us.
- No.

00:34:31.097 --> 00:34:32.367
I can't spoil it.

00:34:33.837 --> 00:34:35.607
(How does she know her?)

00:34:36.137 --> 00:34:37.137
What?

00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:38.437
- You know her?
- Yes.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.377
- Hi.
- How?

00:34:40.977 --> 00:34:42.377
- You know her?
- Yes.

00:34:44.547 --> 00:34:47.217
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- So am I.

00:34:47.617 --> 00:34:48.987
- Maybe a handshake.
- Sure.

00:34:50.187 --> 00:34:51.456
Don't you have to put your purse away?

00:34:51.457 --> 00:34:52.457
I'm okay.

00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:54.157
- I'll put my bag away first.
- Okay.

00:34:55.787 --> 00:34:57.057
So, you two know each other?

00:34:57.327 --> 00:34:59.857
I really admired her.

00:35:00.157 --> 00:35:01.666
Thank you so much.

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:02.867
(Laughing)

00:35:04.037 --> 00:35:06.067
- He's getting more curious.
- He's getting curious.

00:35:06.567 --> 00:35:07.867
I wonder what she does for work.

00:35:10.607 --> 00:35:12.636
(The older women and younger men arrive one at a time.)

00:35:12.637 --> 00:35:14.347
There comes Mu Jin.

00:35:15.307 --> 00:35:16.377
Sang Hyeon.

00:35:22.517 --> 00:35:25.017
Wait. I hear people talking.

00:35:29.757 --> 00:35:30.826
There they are.

00:35:30.827 --> 00:35:31.926
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:31.927 --> 00:35:33.627
(So Hyun was making dinner with Sang Won.)

00:35:35.527 --> 00:35:36.697
He noticed her.

00:35:37.197 --> 00:35:39.467
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:40.167 --> 00:35:42.667
I assumed that there would be a new one.

00:35:43.137 --> 00:35:44.237
Who's...

00:35:44.607 --> 00:35:45.977
It's nice to meet you.

00:35:47.307 --> 00:35:48.476
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:48.477 --> 00:35:49.847
Do you want to put your bags away and come back for a chat?

00:35:49.977 --> 00:35:51.146
- Sure.
- I'd like that.

00:35:51.147 --> 00:35:52.546
I'll be here.

00:35:52.547 --> 00:35:54.216
(She meets Sang Hyeon,)

00:35:54.217 --> 00:35:56.347
(the one she liked the most, for the first time.)

00:35:58.057 --> 00:36:00.187
(So, that's Sang Hyeon.)

00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:03.187
See you in a bit.

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:09.197
(Yeong Gyeong goes to Bon Hee's room.)

00:36:09.697 --> 00:36:10.997
Is someone here?

00:36:11.497 --> 00:36:13.097
We have a new woman.

00:36:13.197 --> 00:36:14.566
- I know!
- Did you say hi?

00:36:14.567 --> 00:36:16.137
I briefly said hi.

00:36:17.307 --> 00:36:18.336
No way!

00:36:18.337 --> 00:36:20.877
I was cleaning up my stuff to make room for her.

00:36:21.507 --> 00:36:22.676
How was the date?

00:36:22.677 --> 00:36:23.946
No way!

00:36:23.947 --> 00:36:25.846
I'll sleep here, and she'll sleep here.

00:36:25.847 --> 00:36:27.377
Oh, really?

00:36:28.547 --> 00:36:29.717
Do you recognize her?

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.687
I know who she is.

00:36:31.787 --> 00:36:33.486
I know who she is too. I told her that I knew her.

00:36:33.487 --> 00:36:34.686
Oh, really?

00:36:34.687 --> 00:36:36.086
All the girls know who she is.

00:36:36.087 --> 00:36:37.087
(Yeong Gyeong recognized So Hyun as well.)

00:36:37.597 --> 00:36:39.157
- She must be famous.
- But the guys don't know her.

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:43.366
"Oh, my. This could bring big changes."

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:45.097
The thought crossed my mind.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:51.277
And it made me nervous again like I was on the first day.

00:36:51.337 --> 00:36:52.677
Oh, really?

00:36:54.377 --> 00:37:01.487
(There's subtle tension among the older women now.)

00:37:02.417 --> 00:37:03.816
Is he cooking right now?

00:37:03.817 --> 00:37:06.356
He's making suyuk.

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.357
I thought something smelled good. I guess it was suyuk.

00:37:10.057 --> 00:37:11.227
- Oh, my.
- But it's too big.

00:37:11.857 --> 00:37:13.456
Do you need help? I'll hold the plate.

00:37:13.457 --> 00:37:14.697
I'll put this one on it.

00:37:15.297 --> 00:37:16.367
It looks really good.

00:37:16.497 --> 00:37:17.667
Sang Won, you should have it all.

00:37:17.997 --> 00:37:19.896
- Exactly.
- Don't share it with anyone.

00:37:19.897 --> 00:37:21.137
My, it looks amazing.

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:24.277
- Look how juicy it is.
- We left more food than we thought.

00:37:24.877 --> 00:37:26.337
- It's soft, right?
- You did a great job.

00:37:26.607 --> 00:37:27.677
- Did I?
- Let's put some here.

00:37:28.777 --> 00:37:30.377
Oh, right. He bought wasabi too.

00:37:30.677 --> 00:37:31.977
- Wasabi?
- Yes.

00:37:33.377 --> 00:37:35.186
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:37.017
Really, Sang Won?

00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:39.517
Yes, but I'm not sure if we have something to go with it.

00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:41.427
I want to eat it now.

00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:44.397
- Did you say you wanted it?
- Yes, I did.

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:46.227
Does she have rhinitis?

00:37:46.627 --> 00:37:47.666
Don't be like that.

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:48.726
(He's hilarious.)

00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:51.866
I have rhinitis. Eating some wasabi...

00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:53.266
- relieves a stuffy nose.
- Seul Hye.

00:37:53.267 --> 00:37:54.707
(Excited)

00:37:55.107 --> 00:37:56.906
- That's amazing.
- It's over there.

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.236
- Are you serious?
- She seems so excited.

00:37:58.237 --> 00:37:59.307
- She seems elated.
- Yes.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.446
- I'm so happy.
- "I'm so happy."

00:38:01.447 --> 00:38:03.907
It's so nice of him to remember what she said and bought wasabi.

00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:07.446
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. It's nothing.

00:38:07.447 --> 00:38:08.517
For the wasabi.

00:38:11.417 --> 00:38:12.456
She seems so happy.

00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:16.157
(Did Sang Won express his feelings by getting wasabi?)

00:38:16.887 --> 00:38:19.127
- It looks so good.
- Indeed.

00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:21.466
It looks really juicy.

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:22.566
It must be really tasty.

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:23.867
Look. There's wasabi next to suyuk.

00:38:24.537 --> 00:38:25.637
- Cheers.
- It looks delicious.

00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:28.566
- Welcome.
- It's nice to meet you all.

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:30.507
(They throw So Hyun a welcome party with Sang Won's suyuk.)

00:38:33.737 --> 00:38:34.976
Did you try the suyuk?

00:38:34.977 --> 00:38:37.277
(Surprised)

00:38:37.377 --> 00:38:38.447
It's good.

00:38:38.977 --> 00:38:40.717
Oh, my. It's so good.

00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:42.447
Is it good?

00:38:42.447 --> 00:38:43.447
(Nodding)

00:38:43.448 --> 00:38:45.157
- Oh, we have wasabi too.
- Yes.

00:38:45.687 --> 00:38:47.157
I think someone was looking for it.

00:38:47.857 --> 00:38:49.457
- Is she a wasabi lover?
- In the middle.

00:38:50.257 --> 00:38:51.257
(Glancing)

00:38:51.258 --> 00:38:52.927
(Happy)

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:54.826
(Wasabi)

00:38:54.827 --> 00:38:56.467
She puts some wasabi on meat.

00:38:56.527 --> 00:38:58.696
(She eats meat with some wasabi, which Sang Won bought.)

00:38:58.697 --> 00:39:01.167
Don't you want to try something with me?

00:39:01.237 --> 00:39:02.406
(Impressed)

00:39:02.407 --> 00:39:03.467
She likes it so much.

00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:06.006
- It's so good.
- She likes it so much.

00:39:06.007 --> 00:39:07.907
It's good. It's really tasty.

00:39:08.547 --> 00:39:11.677
Indeed. He's good at cooking enough to brag about it.

00:39:12.877 --> 00:39:14.487
(Embarrassed)

00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:20.057
You were surprised at first, right?

00:39:20.817 --> 00:39:22.356
I was emotionally ready for it.

00:39:22.357 --> 00:39:24.697
We were joking about it. "It will be me."

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.826
- All our guesses were wrong.
- All of them were wrong.

00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:32.396
My car was in the front, right?

00:39:32.397 --> 00:39:34.267
So I was watching through the side-view mirror.

00:39:34.407 --> 00:39:37.206
We guessed the owners of the bags.

00:39:37.207 --> 00:39:38.507
But all our guesses were wrong.

00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:40.006
- But you guessed one right.
- Ye Eun, who did you think it was?

00:39:40.007 --> 00:39:41.247
Whom did you want to pick?

00:39:42.307 --> 00:39:43.846
(Taken aback)

00:39:43.847 --> 00:39:45.617
Tell him. Answer the question.

00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:47.786
You must've expected to be asked this question.

00:39:47.787 --> 00:39:49.487
Weren't you ready to answer it when you brought it up?

00:39:50.587 --> 00:39:51.657
My, it's scary.

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:53.687
Why are you all so scary?

00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:55.527
I just asked out of curiosity.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.697
She said it with a smile.

00:39:58.997 --> 00:40:01.566
The biggest reason I couldn't choose the person...

00:40:01.567 --> 00:40:02.567
that I wanted to choose...

00:40:02.568 --> 00:40:04.337
was that we decided the order of picking a bag by drawing lots.

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:07.297
There must've been the bag you wanted to pick.

00:40:07.337 --> 00:40:08.766
(He finally finds out why he couldn't go on a date.)

00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:10.837
- Oh, he didn't know that until now?
- The order of picking a bag.

00:40:11.377 --> 00:40:13.106
- He's smiling now.
- He's in a good mood now.

00:40:13.107 --> 00:40:14.107
(He finally finds out why he couldn't go on a date.)

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:17.577
Did you tell the others about your occupation?

00:40:17.917 --> 00:40:20.647
- I haven't revealed it yet.
- Let's introduce ourselves again.

00:40:20.777 --> 00:40:23.987
I am... How about you take a guess?

00:40:24.917 --> 00:40:27.157
I think you're in the same field as me.

00:40:27.957 --> 00:40:29.157
Based on what?

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.527
Do you mean she's a rugby player?

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:31.657
A yoga instructor.

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:34.597
I think she works in the TV industry.

00:40:34.697 --> 00:40:36.597
- Or a model?
- A show host.

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.567
Oh, a show host?

00:40:40.637 --> 00:40:43.806
A model? I thought she was a fashion model.

00:40:43.807 --> 00:40:44.836
Is that a correct answer?

00:40:44.837 --> 00:40:45.837
(Shy)

00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:46.977
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

00:40:48.677 --> 00:40:49.777
It's nice to meet you all.

00:40:57.417 --> 00:41:00.586
I work in various fields including fashion photoshoots,

00:41:00.587 --> 00:41:02.386
advertisements, and beauty contents...

00:41:02.387 --> 00:41:04.427
as a fashion model. My name is Go So Hyun.

00:41:04.897 --> 00:41:06.556
She's been in the modeling industry for a long time.

00:41:06.557 --> 00:41:08.096
- She's a very famous model.
- Yes.

00:41:08.097 --> 00:41:09.827
- She appeared in many ads.
- Yes.

00:41:11.237 --> 00:41:15.937
(Go So Hyun, fashion model)

00:41:18.637 --> 00:41:20.806
- Bon Hee gave me a hint.
- Oh, did I?

00:41:20.807 --> 00:41:23.277
- I knew who she was.
- How did you know her occupation?

00:41:23.907 --> 00:41:27.246
She's such a cool model. She's not an amateur model.

00:41:27.247 --> 00:41:28.447
She's a professional model with much experience.

00:41:29.347 --> 00:41:30.417
- I saw her there.
- That's right.

00:41:30.447 --> 00:41:31.586
- I knew who she was too.
- Did you know who she was?

00:41:31.587 --> 00:41:32.687
- I watched it.
- She's a real professional.

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.687
I did quite a good job and stood out before.

00:41:34.927 --> 00:41:36.486
She did a great job.

00:41:36.487 --> 00:41:38.927
I used to stand out as a model.

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:43.797
So Hyun seemed very relaxed.

00:41:43.967 --> 00:41:46.667
I wonder if I'll have a chance to get to know her.

00:41:47.637 --> 00:41:48.966
I'm so curious about her.

00:41:48.967 --> 00:41:51.037
- I hope it'll go well between them.
- Me too.

00:41:51.107 --> 00:41:52.577
So Hyun is really pretty.

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:54.547
She seemed pretty.

00:41:56.807 --> 00:41:58.517
She seemed cheerful.

00:41:58.847 --> 00:42:00.477
She seemed like a nice person.

00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:03.087
I like a woman with simple features.

00:42:03.117 --> 00:42:04.787
And the new girl has simple features.

00:42:04.817 --> 00:42:07.487
She seemed to be on another level.

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:12.457
I felt like I had never seen a woman like her before.

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.597
She seemed really nice.

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.467
There's this image in my head when I think of an older woman.

00:42:20.397 --> 00:42:22.837
And she fits that image perfectly.

00:42:22.867 --> 00:42:26.477
A woman who is gentle and friendly, and who laughs easily.

00:42:28.307 --> 00:42:29.877
And So Hyun seemed exactly like that.

00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:35.917
(Have the younger men's hearts started to change?)

00:42:36.047 --> 00:42:38.417
Shall we have another drink in the second-floor living room?

00:42:38.517 --> 00:42:40.387
- In the second-floor living room?
- Can we drink there?

00:42:40.817 --> 00:42:42.157
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Sounds great.

00:42:42.187 --> 00:42:43.187
Sounds great.

00:42:43.188 --> 00:42:45.096
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

00:42:45.097 --> 00:42:46.226
(So Hyun's welcome party, Part 2?)

00:42:46.227 --> 00:42:48.296
I express my deepest gratitude toward the chef.

00:42:48.297 --> 00:42:52.667
(Mu Jin comes down after changing his clothes.)

00:42:54.907 --> 00:42:56.807
(He sits next to So Hyun.)

00:42:57.267 --> 00:43:00.236
(Another man So Hyun was interested in based on his appearance)

00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:02.007
(Mu Jin)

00:43:02.677 --> 00:43:03.877
(Glancing)

00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:08.487
(Looking around)

00:43:08.887 --> 00:43:10.086
(Mu Jin seems to be looking for someone.)

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.617
Is he looking for Bon Hee?

00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:17.756
(He finds out Bon Hee isn't here and leaves.)

00:43:17.757 --> 00:43:19.796
It's because we shouldn't do it anywhere else but here.

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:22.066
- From morning to night...
- Right.

00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:23.866
- See?
- I knew it.

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.097
- My goodness.
- Come in.

00:43:27.297 --> 00:43:29.106
- May I come in?
- Sure.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.206
What are you doing?

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.577
- I'm working.
- You're working?

00:43:32.637 --> 00:43:33.736
Can I see?

00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:34.747
Yes.

00:43:36.277 --> 00:43:37.917
He entered the room. He's the first man...

00:43:38.347 --> 00:43:39.416
- to enter a girls' room.
- The first man to do what?

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:41.817
The first younger man to enter the older women's room.

00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:44.916
But everyone is watching it.

00:43:44.917 --> 00:43:46.256
(That's right.)

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:47.556
- He's so straightforward.
- They're in front of the room.

00:43:47.557 --> 00:43:50.186
- Mu Jin is straightforward.
- They'll notice it shortly.

00:43:50.187 --> 00:43:51.857
It must bother Sang Hyeon so much.

00:43:54.867 --> 00:43:57.867
(Mu Jin goes into Bon Hee's room.)

00:43:59.037 --> 00:44:00.037
Of course, it bothers me.

00:44:00.038 --> 00:44:03.967
(Sang Hyeon's mind is occupied by what's going on in her room.)

00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:07.636
I came up with the concept for this photoshoot...

00:44:07.637 --> 00:44:09.076
and decorated the place.

00:44:09.077 --> 00:44:11.617
- I see.
- Do you want to see the photos?

00:44:12.947 --> 00:44:15.386
So you don't just take photos. You do all the work from A to Z.

00:44:15.387 --> 00:44:16.416
That's right.

00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:18.556
- You plan everything too.
- Yes.

00:44:18.557 --> 00:44:21.256
I choose props and discuss with the stylists too.

00:44:21.257 --> 00:44:22.726
- And then I hand them over.
- That's cool.

00:44:22.727 --> 00:44:24.286
The staff edits them.

00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:26.027
(That's cool.)

00:44:26.357 --> 00:44:28.396
I review the photos before sending them via e-mail.

00:44:28.397 --> 00:44:30.626
(Mu Jin has never seen this side of her, which feels new to him.)

00:44:30.627 --> 00:44:31.797
He's falling for her again.

00:44:32.637 --> 00:44:33.637
He's falling for her again.

00:44:33.638 --> 00:44:36.067
Both of them keep smiling.

00:44:37.337 --> 00:44:38.876
(Hesitating)

00:44:38.877 --> 00:44:40.107
Did you enjoy the date?

00:44:41.207 --> 00:44:43.677
Oh, about that... Yesterday,

00:44:44.377 --> 00:44:46.817
didn't you apply lip balm?

00:44:47.577 --> 00:44:49.747
- I applied it many times.
- Right?

00:44:49.947 --> 00:44:52.186
Doesn't it have something like a red stick?

00:44:52.187 --> 00:44:53.317
Yes, it does.

00:44:53.687 --> 00:44:55.486
The bag didn't seem right,

00:44:55.487 --> 00:44:57.726
but the same lip balm I saw was in the bag.

00:44:57.727 --> 00:44:59.757
So I opened it to see the inside,

00:44:59.857 --> 00:45:01.527
and I saw the red stick.

00:45:02.197 --> 00:45:04.026
Did you pick the bag because you thought it was mine?

00:45:04.027 --> 00:45:05.037
Yes.

00:45:05.337 --> 00:45:07.867
Our guesses were all wrong. It was funny.

00:45:09.507 --> 00:45:10.607
You didn't eat pizza, did you?

00:45:12.137 --> 00:45:13.637
I want to eat pizza with you too.

00:45:14.107 --> 00:45:15.777
What if you have to eat pizza with someone else?

00:45:17.547 --> 00:45:18.916
It wouldn't taste good.

00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:19.917
(They promised to eat pizza together on their previous date.)

00:45:19.918 --> 00:45:20.977
I mean it.

00:45:21.847 --> 00:45:22.987
You didn't eat pizza, did you?

00:45:24.287 --> 00:45:25.356
No.

00:45:25.357 --> 00:45:27.087
(Both chuckle.)

00:45:27.987 --> 00:45:29.427
Shall we go out together?

00:45:30.257 --> 00:45:32.226
- Let's go out and talk.
- Okay.

00:45:32.227 --> 00:45:37.467
(After checking Bon Hee's feelings, Mu Jin feels more relaxed.)

00:45:40.297 --> 00:45:41.536
I didn't know everyone was here.

00:45:41.537 --> 00:45:42.637
- Come here.
- Really?

00:45:43.437 --> 00:45:45.677
- I feel bad for Sang Hyeon.
- Oh, no.

00:45:47.937 --> 00:45:49.306
Where would you like to sit?

00:45:49.307 --> 00:45:50.347
I'll sit here.

00:45:51.617 --> 00:45:53.246
(Everyone makes room for her.)

00:45:53.247 --> 00:45:54.716
INFP, take an action now.

00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:56.447
- Exactly. Linger around Bon Hee.
- He should move around her.

00:45:57.117 --> 00:45:58.317
(Glancing)

00:46:00.917 --> 00:46:02.127
I'll sit here.

00:46:02.457 --> 00:46:03.627
I'm so full.

00:46:03.987 --> 00:46:05.397
He sat down next to Bon Hee.

00:46:05.627 --> 00:46:08.297
This is driving me crazy. It's crazy.

00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:09.567
You left some for me.

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:11.127
(Glancing)

00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:13.367
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:16.466
I heard that gambas was really good.

00:46:16.467 --> 00:46:18.677
- It is, indeed.
- It's really good.

00:46:19.437 --> 00:46:22.046
(Mu Jin hears what Bon Hee says and stands up right away.)

00:46:22.047 --> 00:46:23.307
He went there to get some for her?

00:46:24.107 --> 00:46:25.217
Is he putting some gambas on a plate for her?

00:46:25.447 --> 00:46:26.776
Right, I think he's doing it for her.

00:46:26.777 --> 00:46:27.847
(He's putting some gambas on a plate for Bon Hee.)

00:46:28.187 --> 00:46:29.716
This is what I'm talking about.

00:46:29.717 --> 00:46:31.786
He behaves that way in front of everyone,

00:46:31.787 --> 00:46:33.157
which makes it obvious that he likes her.

00:46:33.717 --> 00:46:35.026
- Try it.
- It's delicious.

00:46:35.027 --> 00:46:36.456
- I really enjoyed it.
- Shall I try it?

00:46:36.457 --> 00:46:37.757
(He puts the plate in front of Bon Hee.)

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:42.997
(Happy)

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.737
(Feeling troubled)

00:46:50.737 --> 00:46:55.277
(Love QR messages have been sent. Check one another's heart.)

00:46:57.907 --> 00:47:01.017
(Yeon House's Love QR Zone is open.)

00:47:01.647 --> 00:47:08.587
(Today, both men and women check one another's heart.)

00:47:09.257 --> 00:47:11.286
(Could the person I chose...)

00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:13.827
(share the same feelings with me?)

00:47:14.327 --> 00:47:17.667
(They will see how one another feels through Love QR messages.)

00:47:20.497 --> 00:47:21.506
(Sighing)

00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:24.907
(Someone enters the room while sighing deeply.)

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:29.377
(Bon Hee, who received 4 votes yesterday, will check the messages.)

00:47:31.847 --> 00:47:36.217
(Did the younger men's hearts stay the same?)

00:47:38.717 --> 00:47:39.916
(Sighing)

00:47:39.917 --> 00:47:41.627
What? Why did she sigh?

00:47:43.887 --> 00:47:44.956
(Two people have sent you Love QR messages.)

00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:46.027
- Oh, I see.
- Two people?

00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:48.626
(Among the 4 men who chose Bon Hee yesterday,)

00:47:48.627 --> 00:47:50.927
(only 2 of them sent her Love QR messages.)

00:47:51.867 --> 00:47:55.407
(What could be the first message that Bon Hee received?)

00:47:56.467 --> 00:48:00.306
(Can I look forward to having kimchi stew tomorrow?)

00:48:00.307 --> 00:48:02.877
(Which one do you prefer? Doenjang stew or kimchi stew?)

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:04.707
(Pork kimchi stew)

00:48:05.247 --> 00:48:07.977
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin made a promise.)

00:48:09.547 --> 00:48:12.357
(Bon Hee smiles happily.)

00:48:14.017 --> 00:48:16.657
(She hasn't checked the second message yet.)

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:21.127
(What could be the second message that Bon Hee received?)

00:48:22.127 --> 00:48:27.597
(We've never gone on a date. I hope we'll get a chance.)

00:48:28.437 --> 00:48:32.276
(He always holds his gaze at Bon Hee.)

00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:33.277
(Sang Hyeon)

00:48:33.278 --> 00:48:34.376
- It was Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon.

00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:37.077
He called Bon Hee out for a chat at night.

00:48:37.377 --> 00:48:42.047
I sent my Love QR message to Bon Hee again.

00:48:42.547 --> 00:48:44.786
I mean, I know how things are going.

00:48:44.787 --> 00:48:47.157
I'm sure I wasn't the only one who sent a message to her.

00:48:47.517 --> 00:48:49.227
Something crossed my mind today.

00:48:49.787 --> 00:48:53.096
We were talking in the living room in front of the girls' room.

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:55.996
And I could hear Mu Jin talking to Bon Hee...

00:48:55.997 --> 00:48:57.497
when she was alone in her room.

00:48:58.437 --> 00:49:01.437
Based on the caring tone of voice and his gestures,

00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:04.166
I realized that he was interested in her.

00:49:04.167 --> 00:49:06.676
I don't know if Bon Hee feels the same way,

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:10.677
but I'm sure that Mu Jin has feelings for her.

00:49:11.717 --> 00:49:14.017
It bothers me, of course. It really does.

00:49:14.987 --> 00:49:16.516
So I just want...

00:49:16.517 --> 00:49:18.987
She's the only one whom I haven't gone on a date with.

00:49:19.087 --> 00:49:22.457
So I just let her know I wanted to go on a date with her.

00:49:23.057 --> 00:49:26.597
(It was Sang Hyeon who sent the message to Bon Hee.)

00:49:28.697 --> 00:49:32.897
(Bon Hee received Love QR messages from Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.)

00:49:33.897 --> 00:49:38.677
(Which of the younger men did Bon Hee send a message to?)

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:42.106
(Click)

00:49:42.107 --> 00:49:45.646
(Bon Hee took a photo of the plant.)

00:49:45.647 --> 00:49:48.047
(One person has sent you a Love QR message.)

00:49:49.187 --> 00:49:54.856
(The younger man who received the photo sent by Bon Hee is...)

00:49:54.857 --> 00:49:57.827
(Mu Jin.)

00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:04.727
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin sent messages to each other.)

00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:10.306
(He seems nervous as he walks in.)

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.566
(Sang Hyeon)

00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:13.276
(Sighing)

00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:14.337
Oh, boy.

00:50:14.837 --> 00:50:19.417
(Are there any Love QR messages sent to Sang Hyeon?)

00:50:20.477 --> 00:50:24.617
(He scans the Love QR Code carefully.)

00:50:27.717 --> 00:50:32.057
(What if no one sent a message?)

00:50:32.627 --> 00:50:35.396
- Come on. Check it already.
- Oh, no. I'm worried.

00:50:35.397 --> 00:50:39.567
(He checks the Love QR message nervously.)

00:50:42.207 --> 00:50:43.466
Did he get zero votes?

00:50:43.467 --> 00:50:47.106
(One person has sent you a Love QR message.)

00:50:47.107 --> 00:50:48.776
He probably hopes it is from Bon Hee.

00:50:48.777 --> 00:50:50.676
- Exactly.
- But we all know who she likes.

00:50:50.677 --> 00:50:52.777
(Bon Hee didn't send a message to Sang Hyeon.)

00:50:52.877 --> 00:50:54.016
(Then could it be Yeong Gyeong whom he went on a date with today?)

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.147
Oh, I forgot about Yeong Gyeong.

00:50:56.587 --> 00:50:59.156
(Should I tuck this into my collar or spread it on my lap?)

00:50:59.157 --> 00:51:01.157
(She pranks him by telling him to tuck it into his collar.)

00:51:02.257 --> 00:51:03.587
- Is this right?
- Well... I want...

00:51:03.687 --> 00:51:07.157
(Is it Yeong Gyeong who wanted to get to know him better?)

00:51:07.997 --> 00:51:10.997
(Who sent the Love QR message to Sang Hyeon?)

00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:14.267
What could that be?

00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:18.877
- "I want to talk to you more." - "I want to talk to you more."

00:51:19.207 --> 00:51:20.737
I guess they have talked before.

00:51:21.607 --> 00:51:23.177
I am Go So Hyun.

00:51:23.607 --> 00:51:24.676
- Go So Hyun?
- Yes.

00:51:24.677 --> 00:51:26.746
I see. I am Kim Sang Hyeon.

00:51:26.747 --> 00:51:28.347
- Sang Hyeon? Okay.
- Yes.

00:51:28.747 --> 00:51:29.887
It's nice to meet you.

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:32.157
(Glancing)

00:51:33.187 --> 00:51:35.786
Sang Hyeon seemed very calm...

00:51:35.787 --> 00:51:39.297
and seemed like a nice person.

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:42.296
- The way he talks...
- How is it?

00:51:42.297 --> 00:51:43.866
is sweet.

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:45.096
The way he talks is sweet, indeed.

00:51:45.097 --> 00:51:46.236
Whenever I see someone,

00:51:46.237 --> 00:51:48.667
it takes me time to remember his or her name.

00:51:49.037 --> 00:51:51.306
I'm still confused as well. I don't remember their family names.

00:51:51.307 --> 00:51:52.736
We call one another by our first names.

00:51:52.737 --> 00:51:54.436
How about we introduce ourselves again?

00:51:54.437 --> 00:51:56.076
- Sounds great.
- He's so nice.

00:51:56.077 --> 00:51:58.076
- I work at a securities firm...
- Indeed.

00:51:58.077 --> 00:51:59.777
as an IT engineer.

00:51:59.877 --> 00:52:01.076
An IT engineer?

00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:02.086
(Sang Hyeon's tone of voice conveys thoughtfulness.)

00:52:02.087 --> 00:52:03.746
Sang Hyeon is very considerate.

00:52:03.747 --> 00:52:07.056
Rather than just asking each other simple questions,

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:10.287
I wanted to have a long conversation with him.

00:52:11.157 --> 00:52:15.527
The one I'm most curious about is Sang Hyeon.

00:52:19.867 --> 00:52:22.907
I think it's probably Ye Eun.

00:52:23.067 --> 00:52:26.177
My hunch could be wrong, but I had a feeling...

00:52:26.807 --> 00:52:30.506
that Ye Eun tried to stay close to me.

00:52:30.507 --> 00:52:32.517
What if I regret saying this?

00:52:33.577 --> 00:52:34.917
When I watch this on TV later...

00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:38.817
(Ye Eun will be taken aback.)

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:43.987
- But that's how I felt. I'm sorry.
- Exactly.

00:52:46.057 --> 00:52:49.866
(The next person to check the Love QR messages is...)

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:52.836
(So Hyun.)

00:52:52.837 --> 00:52:54.797
That's Ji Won's. That's Bon Hee's.

00:52:55.507 --> 00:52:57.707
That's Ye Eun's, and that's Yeong Gyeong's.

00:53:00.037 --> 00:53:02.477
I'm half excited, half worried.

00:53:04.777 --> 00:53:08.887
(She carefully scans her Love QR Code.)

00:53:10.847 --> 00:53:14.557
(Whose heart did So Hyun's appearance change?)

00:53:15.827 --> 00:53:18.927
(Sang Won is the first person she met at Yeon House.)

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:20.826
(Well...)

00:53:20.827 --> 00:53:23.697
(Since we were sitting next to each other...)

00:53:24.297 --> 00:53:26.037
(She seemed like my type.)

00:53:26.367 --> 00:53:29.006
(Did Sang Won, who said she was his type, send her a message?)

00:53:29.007 --> 00:53:31.166
I like a woman with simple features.

00:53:31.167 --> 00:53:32.507
And the new girl has simple features.

00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:36.347
I felt like I had never seen a woman like her before.

00:53:38.817 --> 00:53:43.487
(Which of the younger men chose So Hyun?)

00:53:44.817 --> 00:53:47.557
(Surprised)

00:53:50.757 --> 00:53:52.827
Two messages. I think she got two votes.

00:53:53.427 --> 00:53:54.427
Or three?

00:53:58.867 --> 00:54:01.097
(You have received no Love QR message.)

00:54:01.267 --> 00:54:02.406
(She doesn't know how to react.)

00:54:02.407 --> 00:54:03.407
What?

00:54:04.837 --> 00:54:05.937
Where did it go?

00:54:06.937 --> 00:54:09.706
Wait. She received no votes? Not even one?

00:54:09.707 --> 00:54:10.976
But it's her first day.

00:54:10.977 --> 00:54:12.117
(It's okay. It's her first day.)

00:54:14.777 --> 00:54:15.887
There's none.

00:54:18.317 --> 00:54:20.617
I think it's completely understandable.

00:54:22.687 --> 00:54:24.527
It's been only a few hours since they first met me.

00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:27.357
But still, it's a shame how things turned out.

00:54:28.427 --> 00:54:33.037
If I talk to them 1-on-1 more,

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.667
something may happen, right?

00:54:36.007 --> 00:54:38.807
(So Hyun is done with her warm-ups.)

00:54:40.637 --> 00:54:42.607
So Hyun, it was your first time. How did it go?

00:54:43.177 --> 00:54:44.607
I'm pretty sure she got many votes.

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:50.046
Why... Why would you say such a thing?

00:54:50.047 --> 00:54:52.156
- I mean, it's possible.
- There's nothing wrong about it.

00:54:52.157 --> 00:54:53.187
I agree.

00:54:53.587 --> 00:54:56.857
The guys must seem different to her now.

00:54:58.627 --> 00:55:01.527
- Do we have any cushions to sit on?
- Cushions?

00:55:02.127 --> 00:55:04.197
Shall I give you a cushion? Would you like this one?

00:55:05.197 --> 00:55:06.596
- Here you go.
- You both sit on a cushion.

00:55:06.597 --> 00:55:08.036
Mu Jin gave his cushion to her.

00:55:08.037 --> 00:55:10.037
But she already received a cushion. Is that necessary?

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.107
She already received one.

00:55:17.277 --> 00:55:19.877
(Bon Hee took Mu Jin's cushion in the end.)

00:55:22.987 --> 00:55:24.087
It's quite cold.

00:55:25.287 --> 00:55:29.657
I could tell who was interested in who.

00:55:30.287 --> 00:55:33.027
I think I should be more aggressive.

00:55:33.227 --> 00:55:36.126
- Exactly. My gosh.
- You can just tell.

00:55:36.127 --> 00:55:39.867
Both Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon gave her a cushion.

00:55:39.967 --> 00:55:41.636
And Bon Hee took Mu Jin's.

00:55:41.637 --> 00:55:43.567
- My point, exactly.
- Isn't it hurtful?

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:45.576
- I know, right?
- Watching it hurt my feelings.

00:55:45.577 --> 00:55:49.506
If the man I like doesn't take the cushion...

00:55:49.507 --> 00:55:51.107
- that I gave to him, - Yes.

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:54.877
I would get upset and give up on him.

00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:58.347
Seriously, I wonder how that made Sang Hyeon feel.

00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:02.486
We wouldn't know unless we're among them.

00:56:02.487 --> 00:56:04.126
- Right.
- We need to be with them.

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.357
(Only the ones who are going through it know how it feels.)

00:56:06.127 --> 00:56:09.067
When you become really close to her, you'll see that she's no joke.

00:56:09.897 --> 00:56:12.496
I treated her casually first...

00:56:12.497 --> 00:56:14.866
since we were going on a date.

00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:15.966
(Keeping a close watch)

00:56:15.967 --> 00:56:18.837
We became more comfortable around each other than I thought.

00:56:19.277 --> 00:56:21.306
We really hit it off well.

00:56:21.307 --> 00:56:24.747
I was glad that things were going as I wanted them to go.

00:56:24.847 --> 00:56:26.316
- She's very good...
- Oh, my goodness.

00:56:26.317 --> 00:56:27.646
- with words as well.
- He's holding the glass...

00:56:27.647 --> 00:56:28.846
so that he can use it as a weapon when necessary.

00:56:28.847 --> 00:56:30.886
She has a really deep philosophy on life too.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.286
- Expressing that sincerity...
- It was no joke on the way here.

00:56:33.287 --> 00:56:34.986
Seriously, that's why I loved it.

00:56:34.987 --> 00:56:37.657
He does seem to make people feel relaxed.

00:56:40.927 --> 00:56:43.667
I thought that Ji Yung might be interested in Bon Hee.

00:56:44.127 --> 00:56:45.567
Of course, it bothers me.

00:56:46.037 --> 00:56:47.597
- Well...
- This is...

00:56:48.707 --> 00:56:50.137
It's because I'm really nervous.

00:56:50.437 --> 00:56:51.667
Oh, no.

00:56:52.177 --> 00:56:55.177
It seemed like she had really gotten close with Ji Yung.

00:56:56.307 --> 00:56:57.607
I felt anxious.

00:56:59.177 --> 00:57:00.446
(Ji Yung caused confusion for those who chose Bon Hee.)

00:57:00.447 --> 00:57:02.017
They should experience a sense of anxiety too.

00:57:02.447 --> 00:57:04.147
- It'll make them more desperate.
- That's right.

00:57:04.817 --> 00:57:07.416
(The next one to check her Love QR...)

00:57:07.417 --> 00:57:10.787
(is Yeong Gyeong.)

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:24.137
(Which younger man sent Yeong Gyeong a Love QR Code?)

00:57:25.037 --> 00:57:27.237
(Tilting her head)

00:57:28.807 --> 00:57:32.247
(Two people have sent you Love QR Codes.)

00:57:32.647 --> 00:57:33.776
Two people?

00:57:33.777 --> 00:57:35.386
(There are 2 younger men who chose Yeong Gyeong.)

00:57:35.387 --> 00:57:36.617
(One more than before)

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.686
(Who are the 2 younger men that sent their hearts to Yeong Gyeong?)

00:57:38.687 --> 00:57:39.786
- First, there's Hyeon Jun.
- So, Hyeon Jun...

00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:40.916
(Who are the 2 younger men that sent their hearts to Yeong Gyeong?)

00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:43.427
(Checking the first Love QR)

00:57:44.657 --> 00:57:46.026
(Sleepy)

00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:47.097
"Sleepy?"

00:57:48.357 --> 00:57:49.596
(Curious)

00:57:49.597 --> 00:57:52.967
I'm not really sure who the message is from.

00:57:54.367 --> 00:57:56.607
I should close my eyes in the tunnel.

00:57:57.267 --> 00:57:58.506
You're sleepy right now, aren't you?

00:57:58.507 --> 00:57:59.807
(Laughing)

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:01.836
The question I asked Yeong Gyeong the most was...

00:58:01.837 --> 00:58:04.007
- whether she was sleepy.
- I see.

00:58:04.807 --> 00:58:08.117
I thought a question mark would make it too obvious that it was from me,

00:58:08.247 --> 00:58:10.547
so I just wrote "Sleepy" on purpose.

00:58:11.047 --> 00:58:12.486
That's why she doesn't know.

00:58:12.487 --> 00:58:14.456
(Hyeon Jun expressed his feelings for Yeong Gyeong.)

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.587
Hyeon Jun.

00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:17.227
Who's the other one?

00:58:17.457 --> 00:58:19.296
(The second Love QR Code that Yeong Gyeong received)

00:58:19.297 --> 00:58:20.657
- How did this happen so suddenly?
- Sang Won?

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.967
(The second Love QR Code that Yeong Gyeong received)

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:24.967
- "Recommend good restaurants..." - "Recommend good restaurants..."

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:25.997
- "on Jeju Island?" - "on Jeju Island?"

00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:28.066
Do you like traveling too?

00:58:28.067 --> 00:58:29.067
I love traveling.

00:58:29.068 --> 00:58:30.606
- You do?
- Yes.

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.107
Jeju Island is nice too.

00:58:32.307 --> 00:58:33.776
- Do you know any good restaurants?
- Ji Yung?

00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:34.877
I do.

00:58:34.977 --> 00:58:36.977
- I'll recommend them to you.
- Yes, please do.

00:58:38.077 --> 00:58:39.447
We talked,

00:58:39.777 --> 00:58:41.476
and her personality was so...

00:58:41.477 --> 00:58:45.457
It was brief, but our conversation flowed really well.

00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:48.857
I think I was very attracted to her.

00:58:50.357 --> 00:58:52.156
There are some things that we don't know...

00:58:52.157 --> 00:58:53.296
- between them.
- I know.

00:58:53.297 --> 00:58:54.456
(Ji Yung expressed his feelings for Yeong Gyeong...)

00:58:54.457 --> 00:58:55.597
(by referencing their conversation.)

00:58:56.267 --> 00:58:58.326
Ji Yung chose Yeong Gyeong?

00:58:58.327 --> 00:58:59.636
(Ji Yung chose Yeong Gyeong.)

00:58:59.637 --> 00:59:01.696
But anyway, what's clear is...

00:59:01.697 --> 00:59:04.036
that Ji Yung has left Bon Hee.

00:59:04.037 --> 00:59:05.037
Yes.

00:59:05.137 --> 00:59:06.376
After talking,

00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:07.806
and things are...

00:59:07.807 --> 00:59:09.907
- so clear between her and Mu Jin.
- Things are going well for them.

00:59:11.207 --> 00:59:12.746
(Yeong Gyeong received Love QR Codes...)

00:59:12.747 --> 00:59:14.517
(from Ji Yung and Hyeon Jun.)

00:59:15.687 --> 00:59:18.586
(Who did Yeong Gyeong express her feelings for?)

00:59:18.587 --> 00:59:19.786
(First Love QR Code)

00:59:19.787 --> 00:59:22.787
(The Love QR sent by Yeong Gyeong was an oven.)

00:59:24.257 --> 00:59:27.126
I sent one to Hyeon Jun.

00:59:27.127 --> 00:59:28.156
It was Hyeon Jun.

00:59:28.157 --> 00:59:29.596
Every time we went on a date,

00:59:29.597 --> 00:59:31.726
he said he was addicted to carbs...

00:59:31.727 --> 00:59:33.667
and that he loved bread so much.

00:59:33.837 --> 00:59:36.507
He had said that several times.

00:59:36.637 --> 00:59:37.806
So, I sent a photo...

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:40.136
that might help him wonder and guess.

00:59:40.137 --> 00:59:41.936
She's still sending something that will make him wonder.

00:59:41.937 --> 00:59:44.847
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong's Love QRs were sent to each other.)

00:59:47.277 --> 00:59:50.517
(And Ji Yung's first Love QR)

00:59:51.687 --> 00:59:56.957
(He checks his Love QR Code for the first time.)

00:59:59.427 --> 01:00:01.197
(Ji Yung)

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:06.537
(Whose heart will be inside Ji Yung's Love QR?)

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.367
(Twitching)

01:00:11.137 --> 01:00:13.206
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:14.337
One person.

01:00:14.937 --> 01:00:18.207
(One older woman has expressed her feelings for Ji Yung.)

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.416
(A picture and a single-line message has been sent to Ji Yung.)

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.446
What is that?

01:00:22.447 --> 01:00:24.046
- A rugby ball?
- "I want to talk to you alone?"

01:00:24.047 --> 01:00:26.687
(I want to talk to you alone.)

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:33.697
(Which older woman sent the Love QR Code to Ji Yung?)

01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:37.727
(Ji Won has always said she wanted a masculine guy.)

01:00:38.297 --> 01:00:39.566
(Then, I will...)

01:00:39.567 --> 01:00:40.997
(choose this one.)

01:00:41.267 --> 01:00:45.407
(I think I chose it thinking it was Ji Yung.)

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.207
(The owner of the rugby ball picture was Ji Won.)

01:00:50.907 --> 01:00:53.947
(Ji Won's Love QR Code was sent to the masculine guy Ji Yung.)

01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:59.387
(Does Ji Yung know how Ji Won feels?)

01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:03.626
What about Sang Won?

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:04.786
(Sang Won's footsteps seem especially heavy...)

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:06.356
He has never received a Love QR Code before.

01:01:06.357 --> 01:01:07.556
(on his way to the QR Room.)

01:01:07.557 --> 01:01:09.127
He has never gotten one.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:14.336
(His first trip to the QR Room)

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.637
(Tilting his head)

01:01:16.537 --> 01:01:19.477
(No one chose Sang Won.)

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:23.347
Seeing it in real life was a little shocking.

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:28.117
(And today)

01:01:28.247 --> 01:01:30.747
(Park Sang Won, you don't have a date matching partner today.)

01:01:30.847 --> 01:01:33.457
Really being left alone made me feel all sorts of mixed feelings.

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:35.686
(Following the Love QR Code,)

01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:37.187
(Sang Won wasn't chosen for a date either.)

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.557
I was thinking that it might be hard to get a QR Code today as well.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:45.867
(Sighing)

01:01:48.767 --> 01:01:50.037
(A deep breath)

01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:52.406
(Shutting his eyes)

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.077
Gosh, this guy is driving me crazy.

01:01:56.007 --> 01:01:57.147
- For the first time.
- Please.

01:01:58.447 --> 01:02:00.447
- He can't have zero votes again.
- Please help him.

01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:06.386
(Will Sang Won have...)

01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:09.781
(a Love QR Code today?)

01:02:11.057 --> 01:02:13.496
(Hesitating)

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.357
He has a traumatic memory right now.

01:02:15.827 --> 01:02:19.196
(He presses the button carefully.)

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:20.237
Please.

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.067
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.266
(Congratulations, Sang Won escapes getting 0 votes!)

01:02:25.267 --> 01:02:27.177
Congratulations.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.017
(What?)

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:34.816
(Sang Won's face has brightened up.)

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.547
He will probably be able to guess who it is, right?

01:02:36.847 --> 01:02:38.286
(Sent to Sang Won)

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.616
What did she send? It's a video.

01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:41.386
(A video of the stairs)

01:02:41.387 --> 01:02:42.556
What is that?

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:44.026
She's going up to the second floor, right?

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.226
(A video of the stairs was sent to Sang Won.)

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:47.327
What is this?

01:02:52.327 --> 01:02:54.397
(Grinning)

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:58.367
I thought it might be Ye Eun.

01:02:58.807 --> 01:03:01.277
Yesterday, Ye Eun said she liked wasabi.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.706
I thought I should buy her some wasabi for sure,

01:03:03.707 --> 01:03:05.047
so I bought some.

01:03:05.677 --> 01:03:07.817
- He bought some wasabi too.
- What?

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:09.187
Oh, really?

01:03:09.847 --> 01:03:11.647
Really? Sang Won, did you really?

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:14.887
- I want to have some now.
- My goodness.

01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:16.426
She loves it that much?

01:03:16.427 --> 01:03:17.727
(Was the Love QR sent by Ye Eun who was touched by the wasabi?)

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.226
That vibe is for real.

01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:22.126
(Ye Eun is the owner of the staircase video.)

01:03:22.127 --> 01:03:23.127
I was so grateful.

01:03:23.128 --> 01:03:26.837
I was so touched by the wasabi.

01:03:27.267 --> 01:03:29.707
I called him over with my hand.

01:03:30.437 --> 01:03:31.767
- Sang Won.
- Yes?

01:03:31.937 --> 01:03:33.137
Thank you.

01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:34.477
You liked the wasabi, right?

01:03:35.207 --> 01:03:36.246
Thank you.

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:37.376
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

01:03:37.377 --> 01:03:38.506
(Ye Eun expressed her thanks for Sang Won on the stairs.)

01:03:38.507 --> 01:03:39.647
Really?

01:03:40.477 --> 01:03:43.586
In a way, he could've cared about several people,

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:44.687
but still...

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:48.757
I thought this was his way of caring about me.

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:51.287
Right. She would feel grateful.

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.897
I was feeling depressed, but I felt grateful.

01:03:56.827 --> 01:03:59.027
This couple is a win-win for each other.

01:03:59.537 --> 01:04:00.837
I really hope things work out for them.

01:04:03.067 --> 01:04:04.337
He's running downstairs.

01:04:05.707 --> 01:04:08.107
This is my first time seeing Sang Won so excited.

01:04:08.507 --> 01:04:10.376
- I'm glad.
- Our director.

01:04:10.377 --> 01:04:14.246
(Ye Eun's feelings were delivered to Sang Won.)

01:04:14.247 --> 01:04:18.947
(Will Sang Won's feelings point in the same direction?)

01:04:29.327 --> 01:04:32.226
(Ye Eun had sent Sang Won a Love QR.)

01:04:32.227 --> 01:04:33.566
(Ye Eun)

01:04:33.567 --> 01:04:35.736
(Did her feelings and Sang Won's connect?)

01:04:35.737 --> 01:04:38.206
Sang Won didn't choose someone else, did he?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.907
(Did her feelings and Sang Won's connect?)

01:04:43.507 --> 01:04:46.177
(Ye Eun's QR is empty.)

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:47.817
What?

01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:50.117
What? It's zero?

01:04:50.617 --> 01:04:52.046
(Frozen)

01:04:52.047 --> 01:04:54.117
- Wait a minute. What is this?
- What?

01:04:55.617 --> 01:04:59.527
(Sang Won's Love QR didn't come to Ye Eun.)

01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:03.327
(Mixed feelings)

01:05:04.327 --> 01:05:09.350
(Then, where did Sang Won's Love QR go?)

01:05:09.853 --> 01:05:13.793
(Sang Won's Love QR didn't come to Ye Eun.)

01:05:15.204 --> 01:05:17.434
(Mixed feelings)

01:05:18.474 --> 01:05:23.773
(Then, where did Sang Won's Love QR go?)

01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:25.914
(One person has sent you a Love QR Code.)

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.584
(I want to hear your story a bit more, Ji Won.)

01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:31.784
For real?

01:05:31.854 --> 01:05:33.013
What is this?

01:05:33.014 --> 01:05:34.414
Something must've happened.

01:05:35.824 --> 01:05:37.754
(No way.)

01:05:41.094 --> 01:05:43.823
(What is the message inside the Love QR that Sang Won sent?)

01:05:43.824 --> 01:05:45.034
Let's see what the message says.

01:05:45.494 --> 01:05:47.364
"I want to hear your story a bit more, Ji Won."

01:05:50.134 --> 01:05:53.034
I think it might be Sang Hyeon.

01:05:53.774 --> 01:05:56.973
Anyway, when I went on a date with Sang Hyeon,

01:05:56.974 --> 01:05:59.544
I felt like we had a deep conversation.

01:06:00.744 --> 01:06:01.813
I thought the message meant that...

01:06:01.814 --> 01:06:05.414
he wanted to have an even deeper conversation.

01:06:05.814 --> 01:06:08.724
That's why I guessed it might be Sang Hyeon.

01:06:09.154 --> 01:06:10.224
What is this?

01:06:11.324 --> 01:06:12.693
- Hang on. This is...
- I guess there wasn't anything...

01:06:12.694 --> 01:06:14.323
between her and Sang Won, then?

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:16.194
Sang Won chose Ji Won, right?

01:06:17.164 --> 01:06:20.663
But Ji Won doesn't even know that it's from Sang Won.

01:06:20.664 --> 01:06:22.033
- No, not at all.
- She has no clue.

01:06:22.034 --> 01:06:23.933
Then, Sang Won...

01:06:23.934 --> 01:06:26.774
didn't even send her a signal. He must've thought all by himself.

01:06:27.634 --> 01:06:29.674
"Ji Won." Like this.

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:31.914
- That's right.
- But Ji Won doesn't even know.

01:06:32.474 --> 01:06:34.683
He did choose Ji Won,

01:06:34.684 --> 01:06:38.083
but Sang Won didn't seem like he was that interested, to be honest.

01:06:38.084 --> 01:06:40.713
He was just sending it to every girl as if he were applying to colleges,

01:06:40.714 --> 01:06:41.723
and wherever he got accepted,

01:06:41.724 --> 01:06:44.453
- he'd go.
- Sure, it's okay to apply.

01:06:44.454 --> 01:06:46.693
It's fine to apply, but that college...

01:06:46.694 --> 01:06:48.663
doesn't even know who sent the application.

01:06:48.664 --> 01:06:50.723
- I know.
- This is the worst situation ever.

01:06:50.724 --> 01:06:51.863
What meaning does this have?

01:06:51.864 --> 01:06:54.704
Why can't he utilize the Love QR properly and just blow it?

01:06:54.934 --> 01:06:56.033
I know.

01:06:56.034 --> 01:06:57.203
What was he suddenly feeling?

01:06:57.204 --> 01:06:59.003
- Sang Won first liked Bon Hee.
- This is kind of...

01:06:59.004 --> 01:07:01.573
He also said that So Hyun was his type.

01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:03.144
Then, he gave Ye Eun wasabi.

01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:06.113
This is bad.

01:07:06.114 --> 01:07:07.674
(What did Sang Won's message mean?)

01:07:07.944 --> 01:07:09.784
Based on first impressions,

01:07:10.084 --> 01:07:15.124
So Hyun was the closest to my ideal type in terms of looks,

01:07:16.454 --> 01:07:18.424
but we haven't really talked much yet.

01:07:18.594 --> 01:07:20.694
So, there's Ye Eun, who I talked to a lot on our date,

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.934
and Ji Won, who I've talked to a lot since the first day...

01:07:25.394 --> 01:07:26.463
and who looked out for me a lot too.

01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:28.264
I was going back and forth between those two.

01:07:29.464 --> 01:07:33.373
(Ji Won came to pick Sang Won up for the first meeting.)

01:07:33.374 --> 01:07:36.473
On the first day, we didn't get to talk much comfortably,

01:07:36.474 --> 01:07:37.844
which I still feel disappointed about.

01:07:38.874 --> 01:07:40.343
Yeong Gyeong just looks like...

01:07:40.344 --> 01:07:41.783
- a celebrity.
- Hey, Yeong Gyeong.

01:07:41.784 --> 01:07:44.314
Ji Won really played along with my vibe,

01:07:44.414 --> 01:07:45.884
and she was so considerate.

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:48.953
I felt even more disappointed that we didn't get to talk more.

01:07:48.954 --> 01:07:52.093
I felt more curious about her as I spent more time at Yeon House.

01:07:52.094 --> 01:07:53.753
Tomorrow, if I get the chance,

01:07:53.754 --> 01:07:56.063
I really wanted to talk to Ji Won once more.

01:07:56.064 --> 01:07:57.164
That's why I sent it to her.

01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:02.404
Sang Won might not have that much dating experience.

01:08:04.604 --> 01:08:09.644
(And Ye Eun...)

01:08:13.444 --> 01:08:14.444
(She leaves the QR Room looking dejected.)

01:08:14.445 --> 01:08:16.144
Oh, dear.

01:08:22.884 --> 01:08:24.353
(She turns away from where everyone is gathered.)

01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:25.854
Of course, she doesn't want to drink.

01:08:28.364 --> 01:08:32.334
(She spends time in her room alone.)

01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:39.373
I'm not really sure, to be honest.

01:08:39.374 --> 01:08:41.903
I don't know how Sang Won feels...

01:08:41.904 --> 01:08:44.243
because I haven't been receiving any QR Codes.

01:08:44.244 --> 01:08:45.914
Honestly, I am curious.

01:08:47.644 --> 01:08:50.543
Doesn't he have feelings for me? Did I do something wrong?

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.983
But if I did something wrong, why did he buy the wasabi?

01:08:52.984 --> 01:08:54.454
That's what I thought.

01:08:55.824 --> 01:08:58.293
Since things happened that way on the second day as well,

01:08:58.294 --> 01:09:00.324
I was wondering whether this was right...

01:09:01.294 --> 01:09:03.364
a bit more.

01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:05.364
So, I am pretty disappointed.

01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:11.434
(Ye Eun tries hard to smile.)

01:09:12.534 --> 01:09:15.673
Well, I want to think more about...

01:09:15.674 --> 01:09:19.244
what I should do, honestly.

01:09:20.214 --> 01:09:22.743
Right, she must have a lot on her mind. What will she do?

01:09:22.744 --> 01:09:23.943
(The Love QR ends amid complicated relationships.)

01:09:23.944 --> 01:09:25.884
This is a change of tides right now.

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.084
(For the first time, they checked how everyone felt.)

01:09:32.194 --> 01:09:35.323
Right now, after checking the Love QR,

01:09:35.324 --> 01:09:37.123
the mood has shifted a bit.

01:09:37.124 --> 01:09:39.163
(Complicated vibes are in the air at Yeon House.)

01:09:39.164 --> 01:09:40.594
It has subtly shifted.

01:09:44.004 --> 01:09:47.234
(Sang Won comes to the 2nd floor living room.)

01:09:50.474 --> 01:09:52.874
(Glancing)

01:09:54.374 --> 01:09:55.544
Did you get something?

01:09:55.614 --> 01:09:57.884
(Staring)

01:10:00.954 --> 01:10:02.083
(Ye Eun was staring at Sang Won.)

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:03.254
Oh, no.

01:10:03.554 --> 01:10:07.253
"Why did he do that? Why didn't he choose me?"

01:10:07.254 --> 01:10:08.593
Say something. Ask him.

01:10:08.594 --> 01:10:11.223
- Yes, ask him honestly.
- That's it! Go!

01:10:11.224 --> 01:10:12.264
Oh, really?

01:10:13.694 --> 01:10:14.764
No.

01:10:15.864 --> 01:10:17.434
Oh, was this yours, Ye Eun?

01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:19.334
She's just going to her room.

01:10:19.604 --> 01:10:21.804
- Do you want to talk for a minute?
- Sure.

01:10:22.574 --> 01:10:23.673
(Good job, Ye Eun.)

01:10:23.674 --> 01:10:25.173
I love that.

01:10:25.174 --> 01:10:26.374
Ye Eun, you did great.

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:29.514
(Do you want to talk for a minute?)

01:10:30.744 --> 01:10:36.624
(Ye Eun asks to talk to Sang Won quietly but suddenly.)

01:10:38.424 --> 01:10:39.853
(Sang Won follows her out without anyone's knowing.)

01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:43.824
I bet Sang Won is wondering, "Why is she asking to see me?"

01:10:45.734 --> 01:10:47.364
- Where should we go? Downstairs?
- Let's go downstairs.

01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:51.973
- Do we have to be quiet?
- What?

01:10:51.974 --> 01:10:53.074
Do we have to be quiet?

01:10:53.234 --> 01:10:56.744
- No, we don't have to be quiet.
- He's kind of scared.

01:10:58.104 --> 01:10:59.843
There's no one here.

01:10:59.844 --> 01:11:02.784
(The two came down to the 1st floor where no one is around.)

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:04.514
What will she say?

01:11:06.154 --> 01:11:09.384
- I've never been here at this hour.
- This is nice.

01:11:10.924 --> 01:11:12.724
How was it today? Did you have fun?

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:19.733
No. I chose that bag today,

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.864
thinking it was yours.

01:11:21.934 --> 01:11:24.334
What? Why did that happen?

01:11:24.504 --> 01:11:27.204
Well, so... What is it?

01:11:28.404 --> 01:11:31.844
The belonging that I chose...

01:11:32.974 --> 01:11:35.813
Everyone thought that it was yours.

01:11:35.814 --> 01:11:38.553
Oh, when you guys were guessing together?

01:11:38.554 --> 01:11:42.423
Yes. I just thought that it was yours. That's how it felt.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:43.824
- That's just how it felt?
- Yes.

01:11:44.454 --> 01:11:45.624
Who did you go with?

01:11:46.494 --> 01:11:47.853
The bag was Mu Jin's.

01:11:47.854 --> 01:11:49.124
Oh, really? Mu Jin?

01:11:49.594 --> 01:11:51.733
Oh, that? Wasn't Mu Jin wearing it?

01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:53.733
- Right.
- Yes.

01:11:53.734 --> 01:11:55.033
(Ye Eun works up her courage and expresses herself to Sang Won.)

01:11:55.034 --> 01:11:58.004
But Mu Jin came out,

01:11:59.904 --> 01:12:02.543
- and I got back from the date...
- You can't help it.

01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:04.303
I'm sure that's why they made us choose belongings,

01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:05.614
so that we can't tell.

01:12:06.014 --> 01:12:08.314
But you hadn't had anything to eat.

01:12:09.584 --> 01:12:10.913
She cared about him.

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:11.984
But it was okay.

01:12:12.254 --> 01:12:15.954
Well, if I were to express myself...

01:12:16.484 --> 01:12:19.223
I went to the Korean dining restaurant, you know?

01:12:19.224 --> 01:12:22.524
- I chose to go to that restaurant.
- Right.

01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:25.933
When I got there, I thought of you.

01:12:25.934 --> 01:12:27.134
Oh, dear.

01:12:32.534 --> 01:12:33.574
But I...

01:12:35.844 --> 01:12:38.974
From our date before, I thought that...

01:12:39.874 --> 01:12:41.513
you didn't have much fun.

01:12:41.514 --> 01:12:42.883
- Me?
- Well, I just thought to myself.

01:12:42.884 --> 01:12:44.684
- Oh, really?
- Maybe...

01:12:45.254 --> 01:12:47.614
you thought we didn't get along very well.

01:12:50.154 --> 01:12:51.683
I guess I was trying to read your face.

01:12:51.684 --> 01:12:53.353
(He was trying to read her face during their date?)

01:12:53.354 --> 01:12:55.523
He was trying to read her face.

01:12:55.524 --> 01:12:57.123
(Thinking)

01:12:57.124 --> 01:12:59.294
Actually, I had so much fun on our date yesterday.

01:12:59.564 --> 01:13:00.964
Oh, really? I thought...

01:13:01.494 --> 01:13:03.664
You could probably tell when we're alone,

01:13:04.564 --> 01:13:05.774
but our personalities didn't really match well.

01:13:07.504 --> 01:13:08.504
(Ye Eun and Sang Won's first date)

01:13:08.505 --> 01:13:09.604
Don't you dip it in soy sauce?

01:13:10.074 --> 01:13:11.244
I don't eat it with soy sauce.

01:13:12.474 --> 01:13:15.243
I thought you were kind of frigid, but you're not like that.

01:13:15.244 --> 01:13:16.813
You seem very cheerful.

01:13:16.814 --> 01:13:18.284
(Nodding without saying anything)

01:13:18.654 --> 01:13:19.954
(Reading her reaction)

01:13:20.414 --> 01:13:23.324
(To Sang Won, they didn't get along well on their date.)

01:13:24.554 --> 01:13:28.694
(They spent time together, but their hearts went separate ways.)

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.334
You should decide which way you want to go.

01:13:35.934 --> 01:13:37.434
Gosh, this is kind of awkward.

01:13:39.474 --> 01:13:40.534
Shall we go up?

01:13:47.274 --> 01:13:48.944
Oh, my head hurts.

01:13:50.744 --> 01:13:52.413
I don't know what to do.

01:13:52.414 --> 01:13:54.854
(Sang Won's mind is in a jumble after talking to Ye Eun.)

01:13:55.984 --> 01:13:58.894
I did feel kind of flustered in that situation.

01:13:59.154 --> 01:14:02.864
When I went on that date with Ye Eun on the second day,

01:14:03.294 --> 01:14:05.393
I didn't feel like...

01:14:05.394 --> 01:14:07.033
she really enjoyed herself on our date.

01:14:07.034 --> 01:14:08.463
Right, that could happen.

01:14:08.464 --> 01:14:09.903
So, we did grow closer,

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.773
but I didn't feel like she had feelings for me as a guy.

01:14:12.774 --> 01:14:15.343
So, I'm still thinking about what to do...

01:14:15.344 --> 01:14:17.004
about my relationship with Ye Eun.

01:14:21.514 --> 01:14:22.644
Things have gotten more complicated.

01:14:23.544 --> 01:14:24.614
I have a lot on my mind.

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:28.683
Gosh, my head is in a jumble.

01:14:28.684 --> 01:14:30.523
(Sang Won still feels confused.)

01:14:30.524 --> 01:14:34.954
Actually, there were a few people I was curious about, including Ye Eun.

01:14:36.094 --> 01:14:37.423
But looking back...

01:14:37.424 --> 01:14:39.094
When I see you, Hyeon Jun,

01:14:39.394 --> 01:14:41.664
you look like you're at ease because you've made up your mind.

01:14:42.864 --> 01:14:44.563
But the first person you met...

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:46.774
must've been the one you liked from the beginning.

01:14:47.304 --> 01:14:49.803
Well, I'm someone who thinks that it's pointless...

01:14:49.804 --> 01:14:51.473
to get to know several people...

01:14:51.474 --> 01:14:53.874
by spending short amounts of time with them.

01:14:54.174 --> 01:14:56.543
If there's someone I have in mind,

01:14:56.544 --> 01:14:59.984
I tend to try to get to know that person a little more.

01:15:00.514 --> 01:15:02.184
- I don't...
- Someone you're curious about...

01:15:02.284 --> 01:15:03.323
In the time that I was given,

01:15:03.324 --> 01:15:05.323
- I did what I could.
- Did you want to...

01:15:05.324 --> 01:15:06.324
go out with her again today?

01:15:06.394 --> 01:15:08.294
- What? Yes.
- Did you want to go out today too?

01:15:08.494 --> 01:15:10.864
Actually, I want to go out with Yeong Gyeong tomorrow too.

01:15:11.664 --> 01:15:12.864
- Did you want to go out today too?
- Yes.

01:15:15.234 --> 01:15:16.333
I think you two are similar.

01:15:16.334 --> 01:15:17.704
I feel the exact same way.

01:15:18.234 --> 01:15:21.473
Well, ever since the beginning, my feelings...

01:15:21.474 --> 01:15:23.544
- were focused on Bon Hee.
- What?

01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:26.644
(Kim Sang Hyeon, you're so cool!)

01:15:27.244 --> 01:15:28.614
That's what I wanted.

01:15:29.244 --> 01:15:31.143
I've never seen the guys...

01:15:31.144 --> 01:15:32.754
talk about that when they're alone.

01:15:32.784 --> 01:15:33.784
(Amazed)

01:15:33.785 --> 01:15:36.084
Sang Hyeon isn't some ordinary guy.

01:15:36.184 --> 01:15:39.323
Well, ever since the beginning, my feelings...

01:15:39.324 --> 01:15:41.524
were focused on Bon Hee.

01:15:44.964 --> 01:15:46.433
- I wanted to go on a date...
- Who do you like the most?

01:15:46.434 --> 01:15:47.534
with Bon Hee.

01:15:48.194 --> 01:15:51.234
But honestly,

01:15:52.234 --> 01:15:55.744
I thought Mu Jin was the one who had the clearest stance.

01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:57.004
My stance?

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:58.544
I have a clear stance.

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:02.344
To be completely honest,

01:16:04.114 --> 01:16:05.684
I am not curious about anyone else.

01:16:10.724 --> 01:16:12.353
You two already look too tight.

01:16:12.354 --> 01:16:13.424
- That's true.
- I actually...

01:16:13.824 --> 01:16:16.524
This is what I thought. If they become too close,

01:16:16.794 --> 01:16:19.933
even if I wanted to get to know her, I won't be able to do it.

01:16:19.934 --> 01:16:21.463
That's what I thought.

01:16:21.464 --> 01:16:22.903
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that.

01:16:22.904 --> 01:16:24.833
We are close, but we have to compete fairly.

01:16:24.834 --> 01:16:26.034
It's a competition, after all.

01:16:26.474 --> 01:16:30.344
You just consider your feelings.

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.583
(The younger men start to reveal their honest feelings.)

01:16:39.584 --> 01:16:40.613
It's tense in that room.

01:16:40.614 --> 01:16:42.483
This is good. It's good to let it all out.

01:16:42.484 --> 01:16:44.683
- Yes. It feels good.
- I love it.

01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:46.323
- I feel much better now.
- It's much better.

01:16:46.324 --> 01:16:48.994
(It's the night with mixed emotions.)

01:16:49.924 --> 01:16:51.294
Sang Hyeon surprised me.

01:16:51.394 --> 01:16:55.264
Sang Hyeon said that he's always had a thing...

01:16:55.534 --> 01:16:58.604
for Bon Hee in front of all the men.

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:03.043
That's him trying to keep Mu Jin in check.

01:17:03.044 --> 01:17:05.314
Do you know why he said that?

01:17:05.414 --> 01:17:07.114
He doesn't need to make a declaration.

01:17:07.474 --> 01:17:08.983
The fact that he made a declaration means...

01:17:08.984 --> 01:17:11.044
that he will now take actions.

01:17:11.144 --> 01:17:13.383
"I will take actions now,"

01:17:13.384 --> 01:17:15.083
"so understand it, whatever I do."

01:17:15.084 --> 01:17:16.584
"I said it."

01:17:16.684 --> 01:17:18.553
So people now have some level of expectations.

01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:22.323
Sang Hyeon is going to become very aggressive.

01:17:22.324 --> 01:17:23.423
Sang Hyeon...

01:17:23.424 --> 01:17:25.933
- has to feel impatient.
- Why?

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:29.203
Mu Jin and Bon Hee...

01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:31.234
dated other people for the first time.

01:17:31.334 --> 01:17:34.203
He would only see a possibility if they seemed shaken.

01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:36.143
But after dating other people,

01:17:36.144 --> 01:17:38.103
they went into a room alone.

01:17:38.104 --> 01:17:40.173
When they came out of the room, they were tighter than ever.

01:17:40.174 --> 01:17:43.214
He must've thought he wouldn't have any chance if he waited more.

01:17:43.514 --> 01:17:45.913
That must have given him the reason to think...

01:17:45.914 --> 01:17:47.753
- that it's time to take action.
- Right.

01:17:47.754 --> 01:17:48.754
Yes.

01:17:49.524 --> 01:17:52.454
(The Secret Room is open.)

01:17:54.724 --> 01:17:59.864
(Bon Hee, the one with the most votes)

01:18:00.664 --> 01:18:01.763
(It's her second visit to the Secret Room.)

01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:03.003
It's her second visit.

01:18:03.004 --> 01:18:05.204
(It's her second visit to the Secret Room.)

01:18:06.304 --> 01:18:07.304
(It's her chance to find out the age of a man of her choice.)

01:18:07.305 --> 01:18:08.533
(Open the envelope and guess the age of the person...)

01:18:08.534 --> 01:18:09.704
(you're curious about. Please keep what you learn a secret.)

01:18:10.744 --> 01:18:12.343
(Whose age would Bon Hee want to know?)

01:18:12.344 --> 01:18:13.914
I wish she would check someone else's age.

01:18:14.714 --> 01:18:15.714
Please.

01:18:16.714 --> 01:18:21.684
(After thinking carefully, she moves.)

01:18:23.454 --> 01:18:31.364
(Bon Hee chose a photo from someone's childhood.)

01:18:33.394 --> 01:18:35.333
- It's Sang Hyeon.
- Yes, it's Sang Hyeon.

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.334
(The boy in the photo is Sang Hyeon.)

01:18:36.335 --> 01:18:38.034
Thank you, Bon Hee!

01:18:38.434 --> 01:18:39.804
Well done.

01:18:40.204 --> 01:18:41.774
He's similar to how he is now.

01:18:42.174 --> 01:18:45.873
But when he was little, he looked innocent without the nervousness.

01:18:45.874 --> 01:18:47.744
Right now, he looks nervous.

01:18:48.884 --> 01:18:49.983
He looks nervous.

01:18:49.984 --> 01:18:53.784
(Below the innocent face, there's a hint about his age.)

01:18:54.954 --> 01:18:58.223
(The photo was taken in 2004.)

01:18:58.224 --> 01:19:01.124
- It's 2004.
- In 2004,

01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:03.493
Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.

01:19:03.494 --> 01:19:06.794
(In 2004, Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.)

01:19:09.304 --> 01:19:11.934
(Bon Hee opened Sang Hyeon's drawer.)

01:19:12.404 --> 01:19:15.503
I am always more drawn...

01:19:15.504 --> 01:19:17.774
to people who are calm.

01:19:17.874 --> 01:19:19.113
Clearly Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.

01:19:19.114 --> 01:19:21.143
Because of the conversations we had yesterday,

01:19:21.144 --> 01:19:23.944
I became curious about the person.

01:19:24.384 --> 01:19:26.183
I was curious about him, so I opened his drawer.

01:19:26.184 --> 01:19:27.554
- She was curious.
- See?

01:19:27.654 --> 01:19:29.823
This is why you need to express your feelings.

01:19:29.824 --> 01:19:31.454
You shouldn't just sit and watch.

01:19:31.554 --> 01:19:34.093
If Sang Hyeon takes action,

01:19:34.094 --> 01:19:36.194
we never know what will happen to Bon Hee's feelings.

01:19:37.164 --> 01:19:40.063
Sang Hyeon is the one I am curious to learn about.

01:19:40.064 --> 01:19:41.734
(Smiling)

01:19:42.664 --> 01:19:48.603
(Who is Bon Hee's heart leaning toward?)

01:19:48.604 --> 01:19:50.304
Woo Young said it earlier.

01:19:50.404 --> 01:19:53.543
In 2004, Bon Hee was wearing a duffle coat.

01:19:53.544 --> 01:19:54.813
Is that right? Was it 2004?

01:19:54.814 --> 01:19:56.214
- It was 2004.
- It's right.

01:19:56.314 --> 01:19:57.613
- Right?
- Right.

01:19:57.614 --> 01:19:59.414
- Then...
- They have a big age gap.

01:19:59.514 --> 01:20:01.484
If she was 17 years old...

01:20:01.584 --> 01:20:02.883
He must've been in sixth grade.

01:20:02.884 --> 01:20:04.023
Right?

01:20:04.024 --> 01:20:05.354
- He's in 5th or 6th grade.
- Yes.

01:20:05.454 --> 01:20:06.994
So that's 12 years old.

01:20:07.654 --> 01:20:10.063
That means she's at least five years older than him.

01:20:10.064 --> 01:20:11.523
- At least.
- About...

01:20:11.524 --> 01:20:13.334
- About 5, 6 years older.
- At least 5 years.

01:20:13.794 --> 01:20:15.234
It's not as big as ten years.

01:20:15.334 --> 01:20:16.563
- Not that big.
- Less than ten years.

01:20:16.564 --> 01:20:17.764
- Less than 10 years.
- Less than 10 years.

01:20:20.134 --> 01:20:23.044
(It's Yeong Gyeong's first time to visit the Secret Room.)

01:20:28.274 --> 01:20:33.684
(Whose age does Yeong Gyeong want to find out?)

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:36.824
(Who's the younger man Yeong Gyeong chose?)

01:20:38.454 --> 01:20:41.424
(Yeong Gyeong chose someone's childhood photo.)

01:20:42.564 --> 01:20:46.163
(The boy in the photo is...)

01:20:46.164 --> 01:20:50.004
(Hyeon Jun.)

01:20:51.404 --> 01:20:52.473
(At the end of her fond gaze lies Hyeon Jun's photo.)

01:20:52.474 --> 01:20:53.933
I'm curious about his age.

01:20:53.934 --> 01:20:56.903
I want to check it.

01:20:56.904 --> 01:20:59.173
(The year in the photo...)

01:20:59.174 --> 01:21:02.814
(is 1998.)

01:21:04.244 --> 01:21:10.854
(How much is their age gap?)

01:21:13.694 --> 01:21:16.094
(Can we talk, Mu Jin?)

01:21:16.724 --> 01:21:19.194
(Mu Jin is startled by the sudden call.)

01:21:20.264 --> 01:21:23.804
(Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon talk.)

01:21:24.434 --> 01:21:28.274
(I've always had a feeling for Bon Hee.)

01:21:29.104 --> 01:21:32.144
(I called you to ask to let me spend some time with her.)

01:21:33.914 --> 01:21:35.744
(Bon Hee, can we talk?)

01:21:36.284 --> 01:21:39.054
(Sang Hyeon calls her, and Bon Hee follows him.)

01:21:39.484 --> 01:21:44.254
(So Hyun quietly watches it happen.)

01:21:46.224 --> 01:21:47.353
(I can see things, you know.)

01:21:47.354 --> 01:21:49.364
(I can only approach you when I have conviction.)

01:21:50.424 --> 01:21:55.034
(Once again, he confesses his honest feelings.)

01:21:57.804 --> 01:22:00.233
(That night)

01:22:00.234 --> 01:22:02.674
(Peeking)

01:22:03.944 --> 01:22:06.674
(Someone comes for Sang Hyeon.)

01:22:07.974 --> 01:22:10.283
(So Hyun musters up her courage...)

01:22:10.284 --> 01:22:13.813
(and carefully approaches Sang Hyeon.)

01:22:13.814 --> 01:22:14.914
Really?
