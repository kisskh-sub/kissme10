This is what "made in Korea" means.

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:01.183 line:20%
With fake bills this good,

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:04.233 line:20%
we could do two or three runs.

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:17.277 line:20%
We know who you are.
They're real dollars.

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.420 line:20%
Load them.

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.105 line:20%


00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:55.437 line:20%


00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:58.738 line:20%

I hear the money rolling in.

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.235 line:20%
Auntie, what's wrong?
You don't seem so well today.

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:07.504 line:20%
Do you think so?

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.119 line:20%
I'm fine.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.206 line:20%

Two cards with one!

00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:13.859 line:20%


00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:17.729 line:20%
Your fake yuan bills.

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.743 line:20%
Word has spread even to the mainland.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.133 line:20%
Your bills call every fish to the pond.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.995 line:20%
I barely break even
since the materials are so expensive.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.642 line:20%
Let's do a 10% cut this time.

00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:35.718
Suhyun, you know...

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:38.030
I bet you didn't teach yourself.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.583
The counterfeiting, I mean.

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.393
Didn't Master Yang teach you?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.683
- That's right.
- Girl,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.098
your mascara is smudged.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:51.365
I'm not even wearing any makeup.

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.795
Girl.

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:00.304
I'm going to the restroom...

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.327
Stop right there!

00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:03.043
Damn it.

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:16.905
Han Suhyun!

00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:45.480
Move!

00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:13.507
Not here?

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:15.066
Let's go.

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:27.619
Let go. Who are you?

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:30.344
- There she is.
- A foreigner...

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.378
Hey, you! Foreigner!

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:33.489
Come back, you punk!

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:35.356
Stop!

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.557
You're crazy.
Where are you taking me?

00:04:58.624 --> 00:05:00.560
Circling around will get us caught.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.165
It's not what you think. Follow me.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:05.694
- But...
- Follow me.

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:10.974
Give me a room.

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:14.197
Goodness, your Korean is good.

00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:15.270
It's urgent! Quickly!

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:17.063
Okay, I got you.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.924
The best room for love...

00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:21.860
Hurry up!

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:24.714
Well, go on upstairs.

00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:45.574
The men who were chasing you
are in this motel now.

00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:47.106
Change into that.

00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:48.370
I mean...

00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:51.268
Where did you get these?

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.854
Are you really asking that now?

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.064
What the hell?

00:06:28.313 --> 00:06:29.613
Who are you?

00:06:30.762 --> 00:06:32.112
Me?

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:33.541
Your savior.

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:38.971
If you can't trust me,

00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:40.880
you're on your own.

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:43.800
I won't stop you.

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:49.103
Are you really detectives?

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.701
I had to deal with phonies lately.

00:06:52.768 --> 00:06:55.229
We're from the Seoul Major Crimes Unit.

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:56.455
Check this!

00:06:56.522 --> 00:06:58.098
Fine.

00:06:58.829 --> 00:06:59.902
"Lieutenant?"

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.137
What's the holdup here?

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.575
You can't break my door down!

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:05.319
- Good grief.
- Gosh.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:08.516
Where is the spare key

00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:10.437
for Room 302?

00:07:10.504 --> 00:07:11.805
Hurry up.

00:07:26.743 --> 00:07:29.527
Act normal.
Look at me like you love me.

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:41.446
They have a room.
People always do that out here.

00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:56.246
Jeez.

00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.070
It's hot.

00:08:02.762 --> 00:08:04.180
Anyway, who the hell are you?

00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:07.171
Shouldn't you thank me
before you ask me that?

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.827
I haven't run that fast in forever.
I'm starving.

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:14.145
Is there a good hangover soup place
around here?

00:08:14.212 --> 00:08:15.394
Are you joking?

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.828
After a feat like that,

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.038
you owe me a nice meal.

00:08:20.728 --> 00:08:21.666
Right?

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:29.534
You even drive a truck.

00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:33.974
Did I pick up a model

00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.829
or is it just the outfit?

00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:38.627
You still haven't told me
who you are.

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:41.179
Tell me why cops
were chasing you first.

00:08:44.913 --> 00:08:46.497
You must have your reasons.

00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:48.310
At times,

00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:50.832
unexpected things can happen in life.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.208
Luckily,

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:55.400
you and I got tangled up.

00:09:02.473 --> 00:09:04.133
Haven't we met somewhere?

00:09:09.337 --> 00:09:10.559
Are you hitting on me right now?

00:09:13.154 --> 00:09:15.993
As if you're too good for me.

00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:19.090
How far do we have to go
for a meal anyway?

00:09:43.243 --> 00:09:44.634
I'm so full.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.717
What? Are you done?

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.571
I must have run too much.
I don't feel like eating.

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:58.611
Regarding the favor I did for you today,

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.408
you owe me more than this hot soup.

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:07.361
Name, Han Suhyun.

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:11.243
Born 1887-8, Sui-dong, Seoul.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.651
Your mother left your sick father,
who she had been taking care of.

00:10:15.718 --> 00:10:19.546
You moved to a slum in Poi-dong, Seoul,
when you were eight.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.587
Your father died when you were
12 years old.

00:10:27.613 --> 00:10:29.300
I'll ask you again, who are you?

00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:32.441
I've heard about your fake yuan bill
with the perfect design.

00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:36.442
It's printed on top-quality paper with
intricate watermarks and a hologram.

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:39.892
I heard they're making the rounds
on the mainland and in Macau.

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.003
That's why

00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:43.600
I stole your details

00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:46.170
and came to Korea
to observe you for 15 days,

00:10:46.882 --> 00:10:50.522
to see if we would make a good team.

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:51.879
In other words,

00:10:51.946 --> 00:10:55.532
to see if you're the kind of talent

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:57.682
worth scouting.

00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:04.247
You came to the wrong person.

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:16.604
Yang Chuljin became your family when
you met him by chance at 18.

00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:20.818
He's a master counterfeiter
who has a daughter named Yeon.

00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:25.493
You look out for them
like they're your own family.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.038
You're even trying to pay off
Master Yang's debt

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:32.630
by jumping into counterfeiting bills.

00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:35.387
Thanks to him,

00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:39.154
I found a professional
who will bring money to me.

00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:41.325
What the hell do you want
from me?

00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:44.600
Whether big or small,
you're just a fish in the crime world.

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:48.453
For your family
who shares no blood,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.622
- Don't talk to me like you know.
- I'm sure you're serious.

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:54.997
Then, go big and wipe off your hands.

00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:59.197
You know,

00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:02.189
it doesn't matter how great the plan is.

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:05.901
If the technician says no,
you drop it.

00:12:05.968 --> 00:12:07.537
That's standard procedure,

00:12:08.212 --> 00:12:12.742
but it's rude not to at least
hear the proposal.

00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:16.004
Ready?

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:17.997
Give me

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:20.726
just a minute to speak.

00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:27.626
I want hundred-dollar bills.

00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:30.465
Print 300,000 bills.

00:12:31.244 --> 00:12:34.475
I'll take the $30 million in fake dollars

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:38.067
and swap them all to real dollars.

00:12:38.134 --> 00:12:39.696
It will be equal

00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:43.991
to 30 billion won.

00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:46.393
We'll each take half.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:51.915
It takes a certain type of person
to be a criminal.

00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:54.876
Take one big win and walk away.

00:12:56.087 --> 00:12:59.891
You would do anything for Master Yang.

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.457
Pay off all his debt,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.202
and live happily ever after.

00:13:04.707 --> 00:13:07.166
Eat and buy whatever you want.

00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:39.837
Dad! Suhyun! Let's eat!

00:13:41.548 --> 00:13:42.596
Where are they?

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.233
Dad, the noodles will get soft!

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.856
Why don't they ever answer?

00:13:57.887 --> 00:14:00.366
Thirty million dollars
in counterfeit money?

00:14:01.677 --> 00:14:05.473
I'm anxious enough,
seeing you sell the designs overseas.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.922
That's out of our league.

00:14:06.989 --> 00:14:09.417
The guy is a stranger.
How can you just accept his offer?

00:14:09.484 --> 00:14:11.384
It doesn't hurt
just to hear him out.

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:14.089
We should
walk away completely

00:14:14.617 --> 00:14:16.606
and start over fresh.

00:14:17.182 --> 00:14:18.420
Then what?

00:14:18.487 --> 00:14:20.829
What about your medication? Your surgery?

00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:24.203
If you don't have leg surgery,
you might become crippled.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.934
How can I sit back and watch knowing that?

00:14:27.403 --> 00:14:30.513
You have your whole life
ahead of you. I can't risk that.

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:33.445
What about your debt

00:14:33.512 --> 00:14:36.229
from borrowing every penny you could
for your fishing boat business?

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:38.066
Forget about the principal!

00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:41.067
You're racking up 100 million won a year
in interest alone.

00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:44.219
Seriously...

00:14:53.953 --> 00:14:55.262
Anyone want some ramen?

00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:57.289
I do!

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:58.196
- Suhyun?
- Sure.

00:14:58.263 --> 00:14:59.249
- Dad?
- Let's go.

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.342
- Sure.
- Hurry, let's go.

00:15:00.409 --> 00:15:02.450
- Okay.
- The noodles are getting soft.

00:15:02.517 --> 00:15:04.354
Ta-da!

00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:05.681
- Doesn't it look good?
- It looks good.

00:15:08.044 --> 00:15:09.284
Nice.

00:15:14.798 --> 00:15:15.970
Isn't it great?

00:15:16.037 --> 00:15:17.223
Yeah.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.651
Wait, did you cook
one pack per person again?

00:15:27.782 --> 00:15:31.167
- Yes.
- If you're going to cook it well,

00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:33.203
I told you to make extra noodles!

00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:38.508
Anyway, nothing beats late-night ramen!

00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:41.486
Let's see.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.000
I'm not even half finished.
You can't take all of them.

00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:48.456
I got a lot
with the chopsticks.

00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:49.951
There's only a bite left.

00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:51.364
Come on.

00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:52.324
Have some.

00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:53.621
- I will.
- Go ahead.

00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:54.885
Should I make more?

00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:56.051
Cook six packs.
Hurry and boil the water now.

00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:58.067
- Six?
- Yes, make more.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:10.473
Hey, Yang Yeon.

00:16:11.198 --> 00:16:14.345
I said I'll break your computer
if you keep doing that.

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.353
Mountaineer risk their lives to conquer the mountains.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.153
It's the same for hackers.
It's the feeling of accomplishment.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.442
It's not like I'm stealing data or money.

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:24.966
Jeez, seriously.

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:27.153
Just one more minute.
No, two more minutes.

00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:28.681
If I hack them,

00:16:28.748 --> 00:16:31.243
I'll be the youngest hacker
to get into the Pentagon.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.472
Yeon!

00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:37.029
Fine.

00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:41.521
One more time,
and I'll break your computer.

00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:43.364
Fine.

00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:01.406
It takes a certain type of person
to be a criminal.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.474
Take one big win and walk away.

00:17:39.882 --> 00:17:41.162
Look, Ms. Han.

00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:42.654
Hello?

00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.987
Excuse me!

00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.527
Hey.

00:17:48.594 --> 00:17:50.161
Excuse me!

00:17:50.228 --> 00:17:51.501
- What the hell?
- Hey!

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.037
Good grief.

00:17:56.104 --> 00:17:57.719
I told you to stop.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:01.310
Gosh, my heart.

00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:04.385
I was calling you,
but you had your earphones in...

00:18:04.452 --> 00:18:06.826
Cut the crap and get going.

00:18:06.893 --> 00:18:08.770
I'm going, but...

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:11.159
please take this.

00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:17.511
If you want to hear
the rest of the plan,

00:18:17.578 --> 00:18:19.959
come at 2 p.m. today. From J.

00:18:23.244 --> 00:18:26.124
It won't hurt
to just hear him out briefly.

00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:28.711
Even a dog could
talk me into something.

00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:30.482
That's why I get scammed all the time.

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:32.646
Why would you worry about that
if I'm by your side?

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.022
I'm not doing it.

00:18:34.873 --> 00:18:37.586
Gosh, it's crusty here.

00:18:37.653 --> 00:18:40.036
I didn't know these kinds of places
still existed.

00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:44.537
Sir, how are you?

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:55.522
- What's this?
- It's seed money.

00:18:55.589 --> 00:18:57.494
I haven't agreed to anything.
What's with the seed money?

00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:01.520
Materials will be pricey
to print 300,000 hundred-dollar bills.

00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:03.295
You'll also need a new massive printer.

00:19:04.904 --> 00:19:06.214
Here.

00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:11.257
It's packed with 50,000 won bills.

00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:39.978
It's here.

00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:19.455
This is the cashier's cage.

00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:21.689
They deal with thousands of dollars a day.

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:24.965
They won't notice
if we swap about $40,000 daily.

00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:27.405
This is a foreigner-only casino.

00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:30.617
I will be in disguise,
as will Suhyun.

00:20:31.238 --> 00:20:32.294
Me too?

00:20:56.165 --> 00:20:59.048
You're not just young
and driven.

00:20:59.115 --> 00:21:00.851
You're also thorough.

00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:05.006
Hey,

00:21:05.504 --> 00:21:06.784
what's your name?

00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.758
My boss's name
is a trade secret.

00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:11.379 line:20%


00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:15.546
People call me J.

00:21:15.613 --> 00:21:17.336
You can call me that.

00:21:17.336 --> 00:21:19.067 line:20%


00:21:22.088 --> 00:21:23.397
J...

00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:25.657
So...

00:21:26.395 --> 00:21:27.684
Shall we play?

00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:35.056 line:20%


00:21:38.192 --> 00:21:39.749 line:20%


00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:41.443
We got this!

00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:02.683
Wow.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.062
You're pretty good.

00:22:25.026 --> 00:22:26.227
All clear.

00:24:49.715 --> 00:24:50.827
Good work.

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:02.474
You had something to say.

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:07.522
Shall we...

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:09.799
eat hangover soup?

00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:21.874
We washed $30 million,

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.074
and you want to say something.

00:25:25.638 --> 00:25:27.955
What? Are you going to disappear?

00:25:28.022 --> 00:25:29.759
Come on. Disappear?

00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:33.412
Disappearing means we'll never meet again.

00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:37.036
One day,

00:25:37.575 --> 00:25:39.053
I'll show up in front of you.

00:25:42.402 --> 00:25:44.058
Next time you show up,

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.156
I'll be

00:25:46.902 --> 00:25:48.672
a mastermind like you.

00:25:52.211 --> 00:25:55.409
Master Yang's leg surgery went well,

00:25:55.476 --> 00:25:57.335
and you made enough money.

00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:02.190
Do you still want to stay in this world?

00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:06.912
It's the rush.

00:26:07.382 --> 00:26:09.618
I want more, now that I have more.

00:26:09.685 --> 00:26:11.367
It's pretty addictive.

00:26:17.447 --> 00:26:18.829
You can't be a mastermind.

00:26:19.754 --> 00:26:21.454
- Why?
- You're hotheaded.

00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:22.958
Hey, asshole.

00:26:23.025 --> 00:26:24.640
You can't control your own emotions.

00:26:24.707 --> 00:26:26.342
How can you control others?

00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:28.665
See?

00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:31.601
Look at your forehead.

00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:34.535
Jeez! I'll bite your hand.

00:26:41.812 --> 00:26:45.073
Three years went by fast,
like a dream.

00:26:46.448 --> 00:26:49.063
Being with me must have been dreamy.

00:26:59.058 --> 00:27:00.775
You're not addicted to work.

00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:03.181
You're addicted to me.

00:27:08.807 --> 00:27:11.042
When you offered me the job,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.267
I wanted to punch you.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:15.836
Why does this feel sad?

00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:50.824
When you understand how others feel,

00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:55.594
you can easily predict what they will do.

00:28:00.155 --> 00:28:01.342
You, especially,

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.101
are crystal clear.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.927
That's why

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.046
you should be a technician.

00:28:39.846 --> 00:28:41.969
Good grief.

00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:45.298
You might get scammed,
but never scam.

00:28:48.762 --> 00:28:50.826
I put a lot of effort
into picking that out.

00:28:50.893 --> 00:28:52.443
I hope you like it.

00:29:01.088 --> 00:29:02.472
Is this a goodbye gift?

00:29:05.216 --> 00:29:06.494
Shall we go together?

00:29:16.312 --> 00:29:17.802
I have Master Yang and Yeon.

00:29:19.303 --> 00:29:21.016
I'm happy living with them.

00:29:37.606 --> 00:29:39.031
Haven't we met somewhere?

00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:45.658
Why do you keep
asking me that?

00:29:46.653 --> 00:29:47.785
It's just...

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:50.623
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

00:29:55.958 --> 00:29:57.184
The life of a swindler is

00:29:58.461 --> 00:29:59.726
all fake.

00:30:03.138 --> 00:30:05.798
It's only real when you fool others.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.271
A swindler lives a fake life,
as if it were real.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.383
Don't trust me too much.

00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:17.975
Okay?

00:30:39.373 --> 00:30:40.635
Yes, Master Yang.

00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:45.001
As long as we
send the money,

00:30:45.092 --> 00:30:46.470
they'll let us slide.

00:30:46.537 --> 00:30:49.786
I mean,
what kind of cop says that?

00:30:49.853 --> 00:30:52.436
Master Yang, don't believe what he says.

00:30:52.503 --> 00:30:54.657
I'm almost there.

00:30:54.724 --> 00:30:57.827
Do not send the money! I'm coming!

00:31:08.163 --> 00:31:09.266
I said I'm sure!

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:11.673
They printed 300,000 fake bills

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.055
and laundered them through a casino!

00:31:14.534 --> 00:31:15.546
You dumbass!

00:31:15.613 --> 00:31:18.373
We could just go there
instead of running our mouths about it!

00:31:25.978 --> 00:31:28.169
We were assigned a special case
involving a sensitive matter.

00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:31.070
Damn it.

00:31:31.137 --> 00:31:33.633
We worked our butts off!
Why would we stop?

00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:05.403
I'm not giving up, you bastard!
Got it?

00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:40.254
Dad!

00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:43.021
- Yeon!
- Dad!

00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:44.254
Yeon!

00:32:44.321 --> 00:32:45.640
- Are you okay?
- Suhyun!

00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.203
- Are you hurt?
- Dad's inside!

00:32:49.255 --> 00:32:51.996
You, get out of here.
Yeon, stay out!

00:32:52.063 --> 00:32:54.832
Go as far as you can. Be careful.

00:33:10.564 --> 00:33:11.772
What?

00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:41.213
J?

00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:52.494
Master Yang.

00:34:36.451 --> 00:34:38.000
Master Yang...

00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:39.936
Master Yang.

00:34:40.003 --> 00:34:42.023
Master Yang, wake up.

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:45.156
Stop right there!

00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:50.059
Let go!

00:35:50.126 --> 00:35:52.744
Let me go!

00:37:13.504 --> 00:37:14.702
You're early.

00:37:14.769 --> 00:37:16.656
- You worked all night?
- I guess so.

00:37:19.793 --> 00:37:21.130
What is this?

00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:22.601
How are you, Chief?

00:37:23.237 --> 00:37:24.451
Did you all work all night?

00:37:24.518 --> 00:37:25.804
No, I just came in early.

00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:27.651
Good for you.

00:37:47.413 --> 00:37:48.767
Hello?

00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:51.002
It's Jang Junghyuk from Incheon, Junggu.

00:37:51.037 --> 00:37:54.538 line:20%


00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:56.009
How the hell did you find...

00:37:56.076 --> 00:37:57.223
How do you think?

00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:00.397
Your sworn brother, Charles, told me.

00:38:00.464 --> 00:38:02.619
- Damn it.
- "Damn it?"

00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:04.342
You bastard.

00:38:04.409 --> 00:38:05.393
Hey,

00:38:05.874 --> 00:38:09.133
book a place to have lunch at noon.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.598
You swore at me, so you're paying. Got it?

00:38:14.815 --> 00:38:16.775
You know I love a pyramid investigation.

00:38:17.423 --> 00:38:21.459
Charles gave us eight names.
You give me sixteen, okay?

00:38:21.526 --> 00:38:24.481
Then, I'll set you free,
no questions asked.

00:38:25.053 --> 00:38:26.505
I'm busy. I have to go.

00:38:35.456 --> 00:38:36.771
Gosh.

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:43.713
Gosh, that's nice.

00:38:50.045 --> 00:38:51.564
Good morning.

00:38:52.585 --> 00:38:54.567
Good work.

00:39:08.451 --> 00:39:11.754
The best banknote artist,
Master Yang.

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:15.891
And...

00:39:16.461 --> 00:39:18.732
Master Yang's only apprentice,

00:39:19.704 --> 00:39:21.203
Han Suhyun.

00:39:23.043 --> 00:39:24.224
You.

00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:34.869 line:20%


00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:40.963
It took one year to produce

00:39:40.987 --> 00:39:43.286
the 300,000 counterfeit
hundred-dollar bills.

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:45.641
It took two years working at the casino

00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:48.336
to wash them into real money.

00:39:48.403 --> 00:39:51.130
It was a complete success.

00:39:51.694 --> 00:39:53.249
Yet, after just one day,

00:39:54.188 --> 00:39:55.617
it was all stolen.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.115
Who got away with the $30 million?

00:40:00.182 --> 00:40:01.909
If it weren't for you,

00:40:03.397 --> 00:40:04.429
I would have

00:40:05.027 --> 00:40:07.207
slit that bastard's throat.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.863
The guy in the gas mask?

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.284
That's right.

00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:12.865
He didn't want to be traced,

00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:15.515
so he blew up the warehouse
and ran with the money.

00:40:15.582 --> 00:40:16.901
That bastard...

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:21.634
killed Master Yang.

00:40:34.227 --> 00:40:36.428
Tell us about this bastard
and what he's doing.

00:40:36.495 --> 00:40:38.095
We'll catch him for you.

00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:40.123
Apart from his childhood,

00:40:40.629 --> 00:40:42.751
he said he lived abroad.

00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:47.261
All I know

00:40:49.598 --> 00:40:51.779
is his nickname is J.

00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:53.200
"J?"

00:40:53.267 --> 00:40:54.647
Did you say "J?"

00:40:54.714 --> 00:40:56.089
The FBI, Interpol,

00:40:56.156 --> 00:40:58.495
and even the Chinese police have been
after him for the last five years.

00:40:58.562 --> 00:41:00.102
Is that the J you're talking about?

00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:05.193
I don't know if he's that famous.

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:08.283
He did say

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.256
he was a proclaimed mastermind.

00:41:15.449 --> 00:41:17.416
J was right under my nose.

00:41:46.472 --> 00:41:48.027
Move!

00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:49.975
Move!

00:41:50.042 --> 00:41:51.594
Hey!

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.333
That bastard.
