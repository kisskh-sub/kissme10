[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
[Wuyin Chong, Secret Envoy of Tiemo]

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.330
This must be Chen Valley.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.730
Yes.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.960
Do you know

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.010
Chen Valley has another name?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.690
Mingshanzi Gorge.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.540
It is what we, the Tiemo people, call it.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.380
That's right.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.890
This piece of land,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.300
170 li south of Mingshanzi,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.820
used to be ours.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.420
If Yan Fengshan is willing

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.780
to give us this piece of land,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.740
I'm willing to mobilize my troops

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.420
and help him wipe out the Baiwenhu Army.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.720
[Fang Genghui]
When the time comes,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.250
I hope you can grant me a small residence.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.090
My ancestors were from Chang'an.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.740
They lived in a small village just ahead.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.010
Later, they moved north to this place

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.060
and lived here for 70 years.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.640
The hill behind the village

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.770
is where my wife's grave lies.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.690
Do you just want a small residence?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.090
Nothing else?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.420
It's best

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.490
on a hill that faces the sun.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.420
Why?

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.460
A hill that faces the sun

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.340
is full of white camellias.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.160
It's also

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.260
my wife's favorite flower.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.390
Genghui, you are a man with many stories.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.020
If you hadn't accompanied me

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.580
on this trip,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.370
I'd have been bored.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.060
To accommodate your request,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.380
the person welcoming you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.860
has arranged a musician for you.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.690
Having music to accompany you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.930
is better than having me,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.210
a middle-aged man, with sad stories.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.250
Stop!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.090
Mr. Wuyin,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.770
why are we stopping here?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.620
25 years ago,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.210
a man wielding a knife

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.060
walked out of this granary.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.430
He was a prisoner of war of Tiemo

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.490
but he is now

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.340
ruling Chang'an.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.530
There are ups and downs in life.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.210
It's really unpredictable.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.860
It's almost

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.740
a historical site by this point.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.490
Since we're passing by,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.020
let's just take a look.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.300
Legend has it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.690
that General Fengshan can strike fear into both gods and ghosts.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.530
I want to meet

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.220
a man like him too.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.060
Greetings, Mr. Wuyin.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.490
Since you are here,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.330
I will bring the musician here as well.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.160
This way, please.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.660
[Gu]

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.140
Mr. Wuyin,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.820
your reception and trip to Chang'an

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.480
are all attended by my master,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.980
Yang Chuhao.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.640
He knows you like guqin music,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.280
so my master

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.540
went through 700 musicians

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.370
and finally sent her here.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.980
She is a female slave.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.890
I heard Yang Chuhao is rich.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.180
His wealth could rival half of Chang'an.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.450
Is someone like him

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.860
part of the Huben Army too?

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.220
Yes.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.300
The Huben Army is everywhere.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.570
That is

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.130
why we can gain control of Chang'an.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.550
Your guqin skills are the best among 700 people.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.310
Play a song for me, then.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.320
Yes.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.220
Why did you play this song?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.570
It's full of killing intent.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.100
There's blood on the walls.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.100
It's obvious that many people died here.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.370
If you want me to play a decadent song for you,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.300
I can't do it.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.320
Since you've met me today,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.100
you will no longer be a slave.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.660
Making a girl with such guqin skills

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.400
into a slave,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.600
Yang Chuhao does know how to appreciate talents.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.820
That's...

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.960
Come with me.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.220
When we arrive in Chang'an,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.490
I will help you teach him a lesson.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.920
Thank you, sir.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.820
[Episode 16]

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.180
Thank you.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.140
Thank you, Eunuch.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.210
You are the only one

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.210
who will send food to me.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.670
I only stole two buns.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.560
Next time,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.560
I'll bring you some Golden Milk Pastry.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.070
Yan Fengshan doesn't live in the palace

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.800
and the young emperor doesn't eat much.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.940
The cooks in the imperial kitchen

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.970
have nothing to do.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.850
They cook their own food

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.060
and have many delicacies.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.540
It's all right.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.450
Buns are filling.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.930
It'll be Chou hour soon.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.890
I have to collect the memorials

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.380
and send them to Emperor Yan.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.810
Yan Fengshan is really...

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.530
He's such a good general.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.290
When you deliver memorials to him every day,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.500
Chancellor, you still get to leave the palace.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.980
Unlike us, the eunuchs,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.500
we are trapped

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.530
in these palace walls

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.530
and grow old inside the palace.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.860
[I'm still alive.]

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.260
[I'm still alive.]

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.520
Tofu!

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.270
Tofu!

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.430
Tofu!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.220
Miss,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.420
buy a piece of tofu.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.460
Sha!

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.840
Get me a bowl of wontons

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.990
and another sugary pastry.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.380
You have a good appetite today, Boss.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.340
Good appetite? Nonsense.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.660
[Yang Chuhao]

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.810
I'm troubled.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.380
No matter what, I still have to eat

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.860
so that I have the energy to continue sulking.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.340
You...

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.880
White Hair.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.540
Mr. Yang.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.190
We've not seen each other for 15 years

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.290
yet you still recognize me.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.860
I will never forget

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.930
that gaze of yours.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.570
Sha.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.020
Did you kill him?

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.170
Even if I'm a white-haired ghost,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.410
I'm not here just to kill.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.530
People can see us.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.740
Let's talk inside.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.650
Boss,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.500
what's wrong?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.460
Sha,

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.930
go out.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.290
You won't be doing any business today.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.430
I'm still cooking...

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.260
Hurry.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.040
All right.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.380
It's your business anyway.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.330
I've completed what was mentioned

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.500
in your letter previously.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.700
That girl

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.940
has blended with the Tiemo envoys.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.810
I thought

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.770
I had already paid all my debts

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.980
to your family.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.700
I didn't expect

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.940
you to come here

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.420
and collect the debt in person.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.570
After my family was annihilated,

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.810
Yan Fengshan tried to wipe out the remnants of my family.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.180
At least 3,000 people

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.880
died in Chang'an.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.150
Countless families

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.970
were broken apart.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.040
Mr. Yang,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.740
you survived

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.430
and have done exceptionally well.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.460
You even became Yan Fengshan's moneybag.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.900
As an esteemed guest of General Fengshan,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.740
do you think you've cleared your debt

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.130
compared to those who died?

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.180
I still need to live

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.610
and I still need

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.250
to do business.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.050
Do you want me

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.020
to live my whole life

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.980
indebted to your family?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.660
It's not a debt.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.610
There are too many secrets

your money.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.700
The account is right.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.260
Boss,

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.180
you were trying to fool me.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.230
If I didn't do that,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.980
how would I know

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.530
if you were paying attention?

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.500
I'm devoted

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.700
to serving you.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.900
You are lying.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.330
I've been observing you for quite some time.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.400
Something in your eyes tells me there's a problem.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.810
Is it because of money?

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.720
No.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.660
You pay me well.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.130
Then, it must be because of a woman.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.770
Which woman is it?

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.570
She runs the clinic

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.130
on Xiaocaomen Street.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.770
Xiaocao...

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.910
All right.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.640
Bring me there to take a look.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.900
Let me see if she's a good match for you.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.980
Please don't do that.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.220
You'll be chased out.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.050
What?

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.770
She'll even chase me out?

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.980
Half of the shops

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.520
on Xiaocaomen Street belong to me.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.940
She doesn't care who you are.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.420
She will chase

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.570
anyone she dislikes out of her shop.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.420
A fiery lady.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.850
All right.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.810
Starting next month,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.660
I will increase your salary.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.770
Let's save up a larger amount

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.770
for the betrothal gift.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:44.770
What do you think?

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.330
We aren't that close yet.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.810
I can also tell that something

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.770
is troubling you, Boss.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.940
Is it related to money?

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.740
Do you think I have a problem if it's related to money?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.220
Then, it must be a woman.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.810
Not a woman,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.420
but a man.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.770
A man?

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.550
Boss.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.730
Don't do this.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.490
What were you thinking?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.660
He's the son of a former friend.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.130
He's here to collect a debt.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.770
That's not a problem.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.850
We have a lot of money in the treasury.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.090
He's here to collect a debt of life.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.530
Speaking of which,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.430
that man just now

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:20.820
looked honest.

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.730
We've not met for a few months

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.540
and you're acting like a matchmaker now?

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.380
If you have no feelings for him,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.610
why did you

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.610
keep testing him?

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.730
I don't know what you mean.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.820
With your wealth,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.370
you can even purchase half of the street's shops.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.730
Why did you borrow money from him?

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.420
I think

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.610
you are purposely

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:47.980
testing his patience.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.560
Don't expose me.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.750
How can I still show myself in the future?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.500
Huai'an,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.210
what are your plans

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.500
after coming back?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.730
Yan Fengshan is meeting the Tiemo people.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.900
This is the best opportunity to hit back.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.820
I saw this

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.420
at Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.900
It wasn't too long ago

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.250
when I entered Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.050
When one endures hardship,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.500
life

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.300
becomes muddled.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.610
Bai Wan wouldn't want to see you like this.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.900
Once you settle things in Chang'an,

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.980
go to a new place

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.530
and start all over again.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.780
Have you found the people

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:11.570
I asked you to find?

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.050
I did.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.780
Apparently, they moved south.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.320
However, there are many towns

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.340
south of Nanwei Trough.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.050
I've sent my men to look for them.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.940
We'll know immediately

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.130
if there's any news.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.570
All right.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.250
They lost a daughter.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.460
No matter what,

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.130
I must give them an explanation.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.860
Yang!

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.130
General, why are you here?

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.550
I bought two seabass at the market.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.420
They are fresh.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.940
Zhiying is busy today and can't cook

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.050
so I decided to come here

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.420
to make grilled fish.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.940
Seabass is fatty

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.530
in this season.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.170
Why don't we

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.980
steam them?

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.730
You have high standards.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:29.780
Let me

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.820
taste it for you.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.380
No wonder they say

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.940
you should steam seabass in spring.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.210
It's a delicacy indeed.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.190
Those who eat the back of the fish first

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.420
are poor people.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.610
Were you once poor when you were young?

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.980
To be honest,

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.500
I was born poor indeed.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.690
Well,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.700
how else could I claim

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.130
that I started from scratch?

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.460
Here. Have this.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.550
General, you take good care of me.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.280
Speaking of which,

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.090
do you still remember

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.530
White Hair?

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.650
Are you talking about the son of the Liu family?

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.840
I've never heard this name

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.380
in many years.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.530
Right now,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.620
besides Xiao Wuyang

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.880
and the person from Yulong Ridge,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.940
the only one who is worthy to become my opponent

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.340
is White Hair.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.860
General,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.050
you rate him so highly.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.610
Is he

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.380
causing you trouble?

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.380
When it comes to strategy, I might not be as good as he is.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.820
I heard you had former ties with the Liu family

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.250
so I didn't tell you

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.160
about some of his doings.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.170
However, I need to give you a reminder.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.840
We will be meeting the Tiemo people soon.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.500
It is crucial

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.900
and nothing can go wrong.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.210
I think White Hair might appear.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.570
I'm worried

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.610
that he might pay you a visit.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.650
This...

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:38.380
General,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.900
this isn't necessary.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.050
He is a vengeful person.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.530
I think

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.980
you won't be able to escape from him.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.300
Besides, you don't have many guards

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.610
in this residence.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.880
The only person I know

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.730
is the kid

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.090
who collects debts for you.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.530
I don't think he's any help.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.090
Take this.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.920
If he comes to you,

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.250
you can use it to defend yourself.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.380
I...

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.420
Thank you, General.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.570
Then,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.420
I'll keep it for now.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.090
However, I really don't think it's necessary.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.040
People our age

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.530
don't have many friends left.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.620
I hope

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.820
you can stay safe.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.380
After hearing what you say,

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.980
I'll make sure to survive.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.340
I still want

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.960
to eat fish and drink wine

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.980
with you

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.640
after 20 years.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.450
All right.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.250
Come on.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.050
Cheers.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:58.460
[All-Goods Shop]

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.420
Sir.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.020
What do you want? Browse on your own.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.250
Sure.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.610
Sir,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.570
there's a plant

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.250
used for chewing

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.820
called Bitter-After.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.900
I've searched many shops but I couldn't find it.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.170
I wonder if you have it here.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.420
Sir, you are lucky today.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.940
I have it.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.980
Sir, please take a look.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.020
This is it.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.980
There's no mistake about it.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.380
Not many people

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.650
were willing to buy it back then in Chang'an.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.780
It was too bitter.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.530
Many people have been buying it recently.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.020
You know your stuff.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.860
Buy all of them

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.610
and I'll only charge two liang of silver.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.090
I might not be a regular customer

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:59.300
but isn't this

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.300
too expensive, sir?

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.420
Besides,

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.500
this can be found everywhere in Tiemo.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.530
It should

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.570
be cheaper than the hay used to feed horses.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.090
Sir, it's like this.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.940
Bitter-After was dirt cheap at first,

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.500
but these are turbulent times now.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.610
There might be

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.300
a war with Tiemo tomorrow.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.730
There's an unstable supply

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.820
so it is scarce.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.040
Naturally,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.460
the price has increased as well.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:23.980
All right.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.280
Give me a bundle of it.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.690
Got it.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.050
Sir, are you giving it to your friends?

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.090
No.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.380
I'm giving it

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.460
to an old friend I've not met for many years.
