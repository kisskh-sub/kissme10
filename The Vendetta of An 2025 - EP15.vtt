[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.260
General.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.770
The man has been brought in.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.020
Do you have parents or brothers at home?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.740
Do you have any relatives or friends in your hometown?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.380
General.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.020
I am an orphan.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.370
Come.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.850
Come up.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.660
Forget your past and your name.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.170
Remember every word I say.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.380
Your surname is actually Xiao.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.170
A child of the Xiao imperial bloodline

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.540
who has been lost outside.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.340
The late emperor once secretly ordered me to bring you back.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.170
I searched for years.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.290
At last, you may return to the rightful lineage.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.890
The throne now stands empty.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.290
Chang'an cannot go a single day without an emperor.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.890
Among the Xiao clan,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.100
you are the only one left.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.500
From this moment on,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.130
you are the emperor of this land.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.610
Is that true?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.940
Of course it is not.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.730
But if I say it is true,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.320
then it is true.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.060
Zhiying.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.260
Take him down and put this dragon robe on him.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.850
See whether it fits or not.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.610
Yes.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.890
Come with me.

[Episode 15]

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.080
[Awakening and Returning to Purity]

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.940
Do you know,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220
you and I met when we were very young?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.730
It was about 19 years ago.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.540
Yan Fengshan

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.450
had not yet become a traitorous general.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.860
He was cold,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.940
cruel,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.980
and not like he is now,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.290
still able to put on

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.410
a guise of kindness.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.610
At that time,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.410
he adopted a child.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.290
That child had been brought from the northern border.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.940
He had no parents.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.690
Back then,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.450
I saw you.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.050
At that time, your eyes

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.290
would always look to the horizon.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.220
Unlike how they are now.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.050
What about me

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.370
now?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.220
The way you are now,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.140
your eyes only stare at what is right in front of you.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.810
A person like this

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.950
easily becomes obsessive.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.170
You asked what tricks I have.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.100
I have none.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.290
You people are the ones who control Chang'an.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.170
But I do have a story

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.050
that I want to tell you.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.560
It is about your origins

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.490
and Yan Fengshan's past.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.900
How many dumplings will you eat?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.020
Your origins

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.960
are exactly so.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.660
How you choose

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.220
is entirely up to you.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.720
How

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.340
can I choose?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.010
To avenge your blood kin

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.920
is only right.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.290
Let the past 20 years

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.170
be treated as no more than a dream.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.490
If you carry out this task,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.290
you may live for six more hours.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.850
If you refuse...

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.610
Commander Wang is right outside the door.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.170
He hides his skill deep within.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.800
His blade is the same.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.080
You will not get past that doorway

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.010
and will only die here.

[Awakening and Returning to Purity]

Xie Huai'an.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.610
To live your whole life this way,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.680
aren't you tired?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.930
What you should ask me

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.780
is whether it is right to live this way.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.220
I once believed I was right.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.980
You killed far too many who should not have died.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.780
I will never let you win.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.980
Whatever you intend to do,

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.130
I will never

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.290
let you succeed.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.250
Do you want to see

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.370
Yan Fengshan die with your own eyes?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.140
Nothing would please me more.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.370
Thank you.

Sir.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.290
What would you like?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.700
One and a half jin of hind leg meat,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.580
for making dumplings for two people.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.180
All right. One moment.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.780
Sir.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.900
Here you go.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.530
You are back, General.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.610
I have not cooked for you in a long time.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.770
I shall practice today,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.130
so I do not get rusty.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.240
The people you assigned to keep an eye on me

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.490
have already been eliminated.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.260
I know.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.460
But I did not bother with it.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.460
It is Xie Huai'an

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.520
who is setting a trap for me.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.490
That is fine.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.370
I wanted to meet him anyway.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.490
I figured as much.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.180
White Hair is a ruthless man.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.250
For you to return alive

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.980
is no small feat.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.730
But I feel

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.770
he has no tricks left.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.610
He only told me

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.300
a piece of the past,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.490
something about my origins.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.530
Then he let me go.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.670
He even asked me

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.100
whether I was willing

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.130
to make dumplings for you.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.930
The dumplings are cooked,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.730
General,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.250
but do not rush to eat them yet.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.250
In strategy,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.060
I am no match for Xie Huai'an.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.040
But I am not foolish enough

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.180
to let a piece of the past

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.710
erase the years I have spent

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.770
following you.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.420
I waited here for you,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.820
simply to ask for clarity.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.990
I never spoke of the past to you

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.530
not because I did not want you to know,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.700
but because I did not want to remember it myself.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.940
Now that things have come to this,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.820
I shall tell you.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.080
25 years ago,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.520
in the northern borderlands,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.850
there was a place

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.880
called Chen Valley.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.530
We called it Chen Valley,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.220
but the Tiemo people

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.890
called that place

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.580
Mingshanzi Gorge.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.720
A tiny patch of land,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.820
yet we and the Tiemo people

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.370
fought over it seven times.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.340
In the final battle,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.530
we lost.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.540
My soldiers and I

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.320
were captured

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.290
and locked inside the Tiemo army's granary,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.100
waiting quietly for death.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.940
The Tiemo people were toying with the prisoners.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.580
Each time they lowered the food,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.820
there was less than before.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.630
The last time,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.940
they dropped only one steamed bun

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.860
and one knife.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.040
It seemed only I understood

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.460
that no matter how much food

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.810
the Tiemo people gave us,

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.070
none of us would survive

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.530
until the day they opened the granary.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.610
Unless the Tiemo people

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.760
believed we were all dead.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.770
So I

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.250
killed every last one of them.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.300
After that,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.700
many more days passed.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.610
After I killed all the Tiemo people,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.350
I wandered across the wasteland for a long time.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.370
At that time I felt like a ghost,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.300
not knowing where I should go,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.130
not knowing whether I even deserved to live.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.580
I walked for a very long time.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.160
At last, I returned to my motherland.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.700
A farming couple took me in.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.580
They were not afraid of me.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.850
Instead they gave me a bowl of hot rice.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.550
Here, sir,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.970
do not be shy.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.730
Eat quickly.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.750
Treat this as your own home.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.820
Yes, sir,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.890
I still have some meat here.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.820
It will be ready soon.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.340
Go on eat. There is more in the pot.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.980
At that time,

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.250
or perhaps for many years after,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.940
I had not

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.410
truly stepped out of that granary.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.300
I believed

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.080
that only by killing everyone

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400
could I earn a single meal.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.980
That child was you.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.340
This story,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.250
is it the same

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.530
as the one White Hair told you?

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.100
If I had died in that granary,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.340
or if your parents

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.220
had not taken me in,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.220
you would never have become a member of the Huben Army.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.850
The village where you were born

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.240
stood on a sunny hillside.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.350
You could have been a farmer,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.560
and after a day of work,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.770
you could still go home to eat dumplings,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.280
with your parents

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.770
not yet old sitting beside you.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.130
What a wonderful life that would have been.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.060
But because of me,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.700
your entire life changed.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.700
So

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.250
today you were used by White Hair

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.980
and tried to poison me.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.580
To avenge my blood kin

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.300
is only just.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.460
Let the past 20 years

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.980
be treated as a dream.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.420
I do not blame you.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.660
When I was seven,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.380
I learned how to make dumplings.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.570
I even wrapped

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:14.860
a copper coin inside one.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.220
I hoped you would eat it,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.330
and I wished you long life,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.380
peace and safety.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.530
Xie Huai'an even tried to sway me,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.660
hoping I would come back and poison you.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.330
How could that ever happen?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.090
If not you,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.180
how would I be who I am today?

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.280
As for those parents,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.530
I never laid eyes on them,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.250
not even for a single day.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.290
Their deaths mean nothing to me.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.720
All these years,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.290
the one who raised me

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.140
was the General of the Huben Army,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.050
Yan Fengshan.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.860
He wants to watch you die with his own eyes.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.940
He has already entered the city with me.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.420
Stop.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.000
Come here.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.420
Do you have a travel pass?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.420
Yes.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.490
From Huai'an Commandery.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.660
My surname is Zeng.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.980
Go on.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.320
Thank you.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.220
Only three watchtowers nearby

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.570
have a view of this courtyard.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.000
A man wearing a fisherman's hat,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.080
with half his face covered,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.180
and a fish maw mask on his upper face,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.180
that is Xie Huai'an.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.290
Before you returned,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.250
I had already sent Zhiying

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.490
to hunt him down.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.870
This

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.380
is the final plan

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.700
I offer to you.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.250
The past

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.380
has nothing to do with me.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.730
In this life,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.660
I have no regrets.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.940
To die with a father not yet old

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.700
beside me,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.050
that is a fine life.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.220
May you live a thousand years.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.110
Peace,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.180
and safety.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.490
Wang Pu,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.810
you are truly foolish.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.150
A man like White Hair

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.680
would never believe

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.940
you would poison me.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.860
He merely wanted you

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.010
to return to my side,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.250
so that I could watch you

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.460
die with my own eyes.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.530
General.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.220
The man wearing the fish maw mask

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.220
was not Xie Huai'an at all.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.290
What do you mean what?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.660
We have known each other for quite some time.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.660
Yet I still failed to see your true nature.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.420
You would sell out the loyal and upright

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.760
and even abet villains

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.160
for money.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.830
No wonder this temple has so few devotees.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.420
It is not the location.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.180
It is your wicked heart.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.490
How shall we deal with him?

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.770
Mister, spare me.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:41.660
Sir, spare me.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.410
Sir, spare me.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.810
Please stand.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.660
I am but a wanted man.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.660
Your life

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.380
is not mine to spare.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.420
You knew my identity long ago.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.530
You waited and observed for a month,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.660
and only when you thought I had gone mad

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.700
did you report me.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.720
To have such careful judgment,

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.380
sir,

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.940
why waste it

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.050
on a gambling table?

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.490
I, Xie Huai'an,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.510
thank you

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.010
for taking me in during this time.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.310
Thank you, sir, for sparing my life.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.610
Thank you for sparing my life.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.000
- Thank you for sparing my life. - Go.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.330
Go.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.860
Commander Wang.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.770
Here.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.700
Return to the Capital first.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.980
Prepare to gather all available men in the Capital.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:47.940
Yes.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.380
The Tiemo secret envoy has already set off.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.110
This is our chance

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.900
to strike back.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.850
For this day,

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.700
I have waited a long time too.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.570
I await your command.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.770
Mr. Long.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.390
You did not visit before,

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.460
nor did you send a letter.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.250
There are many people

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.050
worried about you.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.290
I was watched too closely this time,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.250
so I dared not write rashly.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.250
Please forgive me, Mr. Long.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.420
Come.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.750
I will take you to see

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.420
the place your father left behind.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:16.640
Look here.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.390
I even added a bit more for you.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.760
Is it enough?

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.130
Enough.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.800
All right. That will be seven wen in total.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.280
All right.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.390
I will pack it for you.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.290
All right.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:47.700
All right then.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.300
Here you go.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:50.530
Count it.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.100
Thank you.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.090
You finally showed up.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.660
What?

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.700
Did you think I died?

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.250
No.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.700
No...

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:36.980
Sir.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.770
I have something to attend to...

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.420
Come.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.180
How?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.420
This place is nice, isn't it?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.250
You will never

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.730
see scenery like this in Chang'an.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.050
It is practically a paradise.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.660
But this paradise

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.900
has one flaw.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.220
There is no sunlight.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.180
Without sunlight, there are no crops.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.380
So

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.730
rice is more expensive than salt here.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.140
Right.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.460
This paradise

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.420
has another flaw.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.440
You cannot see the sun,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.580
so you cannot tell the time.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.570
Rising with the sun and resting at sunset

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.220
is impossible here.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.980
The salt shop where you work

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.250
has a salt hourglass

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:32.940
to keep time, doesn't it?

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.730
How do you know that?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.940
And the shops along the street

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.250
also have hourglasses for timing.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.490
You know that too?

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.860
Have you been here before?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.160
Using hourglasses to keep time

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.590
was an assignment from Mr. Wu Zhongheng

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.810
back when we were at the Grand Academy.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.720
If I remember correctly,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.180
you pretended to be sick

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.770
and never handed in your work.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.050
And you...

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.660
Still pretending?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.310
The hourglass in your shop

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.380
is the result of my assignment.

00:29:02.381 --> 00:29:08.565
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.680
My father originally

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.660
designed this Cangshui River

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.010
because there was no daylight here,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.980
which was why he moved everything inside.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.130
Since there is me,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.630
why must there be you?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.050
Zheng,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.220
look who is here.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.060
Who else could it be?

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.220
Isn't that Xie Huai'an?

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.250
Why are you so cold?

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.140
It has been a long time.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.180
I know.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.730
It is because he came to see me first,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.490
is that right?

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.770
Thank you for going to the trouble.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.920
We just met.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.600
And we discussed strategy.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.980
Do you want to hear the details of the strategy?

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.940
Come with me.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.180
I will tell you slowly.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.700
Little one.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.920
No. When did you ever talk about strategy?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.530
You're the little one.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.380
Little Mo.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.540
Get lost.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.400
Chang'an is now sealed tight.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.360
Yan Fengshan and the Huben Army

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.360
control everything.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.510
But the civil court is still running,

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.560
so

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:12.990
the people of Chang'an

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.640
have not been pushed to outrage.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.930
The troops of Xiao Wuyang outside the city

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.430
are surrounded by the four regional military commanders.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.650
But they have not cut off supplies.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:22.990
Otherwise

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.870
the Wuyang Army would likely fight with their backs to the river.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.950
Yan Fengshan is truly capable.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.640
He restrains the troops

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.910
without provoking war,

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.710
and controls the city

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.160
without stirring public anger.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:36.790
If you ask me,

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.510
he is so capable,

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.440
he might as well make himself emperor.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.440
He has held power for years,

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.510
and the people of Chang'an are used to it.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:48.920
Now,

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.590
he props up a fake emperor to keep things calm.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.830
If he suddenly declared himself emperor,

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.440
it would not benefit him at all.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.550
He can still

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.870
weigh the scales properly.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.760
Isn't there a large army in the north?

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.060
The main force of the Baiwenhu Army.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.790
The northern Baiwenhu Army.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.200
They will not march south unless summoned to defend the throne.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.160
This was once

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.760
the agreement between my late father and the Gu family.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.070
So when my brother attacked Chang'an back then,

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:18.870
Gu Yu

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.590
only brought one thousand personal guards.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.830
But look at the situation now.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.120
Xie Huai'an,

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.510
if you need an imperial summons

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.400
I can give it to you.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.480
With the situation as it is,

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.240
even if you wrote me an imperial edict to summon them,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.440
I would have no way to send it to the north.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.310
If we acted now,

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.480
your identity would be exposed

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.480
and everything would collapse.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.480
Yan Fengshan is colluding with the Tiemo people.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.240
The Tiemo have stationed

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.070
a massive army in the northern borderlands

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.550
to deal with the Baiwenhu Army.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.510
If the Baiwenhu Army marched south,

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.590
the entire heartland of the empire

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.200
would be opened to the Tiemo.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.000
Yan Fengshan

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.790
is deeply entangled with the Tiemo.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280
So next,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.750
how should we take him down?

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.020
The Tiemo people and Yan Fengshan

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.410
are not perfectly united.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.720
Now that the Tiemo envoy has come south,

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.420
he is heading to Chang'an

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.830
to negotiate with Yan Fengshan.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.000
This is our best chance.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.240
I guess

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.870
Yan Fengshan will first cede

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.960
a stretch of territory in the far north

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.000
and use it

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.510
to bribe the Tiemo people

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.680
in exchange for their attack on the Baiwenhu Army.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.270
Once the Baiwenhu Army is defeated,

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.960
there will be no army left

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.790
to stand against Yan Fengshan.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.680
Gu Yu.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.760
Is Gu Yu still alive?

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.170
If he is,

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.160
you must send him to the north at once,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.720
because only then

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.720
will the Tiemo people fail to defeat the Baiwenhu Army.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.960
As for Gu Yu's life or death,

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.070
I am not certain.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.760
And your brother?

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.960
Mr. Long says he can wake up,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.720
but no one knows when.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.950
How did you know

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.040
I was awake?

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.470
I could see it.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.600
I just could not guess

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.200
why you pretended to be unconscious.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.310
I was not pretending.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:14.830
Each day

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.270
I am only awake for a brief moment.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.120
It feels like being in a dream, doesn't it?

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.240
In the dream

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.120
it was the road you had never wanted to take.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.200
A brush with death,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.000
I have experienced that too.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.830
A long palace corridor.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.080
Gu Yu and the Baiwenhu Army

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.600
pushed me out the door

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.790
and got farther and farther away from me.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.430
The path by which I survived

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.720
was the path

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.430
I least wished to walk in my life.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.200
Wumei once told me

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.640
that back then you were one step

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.790
from death.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.310
I do not blame you.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.160
So

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.870
Xiao Wuyang

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.760
can die after all.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.560
White Hair.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.950
If one day

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.600
I truly die,

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.160
will you, like your forefathers,

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.310
support the imperial clan?

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.040
I know

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.640
that is not where your ambition lies.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.950
But you must care for the realm.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.470
Heaven has given you such wisdom.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.560
You must use it

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.990
to serve all the people.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.600
But my father

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.430
once did exactly that.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.270
And you must not die either.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.990
Heaven has given you

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.990
such skill,

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.830
and you too

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.680
should give back to all the people.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.470
I will not.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.200
Before Yan Fengshan dies,

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.310
I, Xiao Wuyang,

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.430
will not die.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.950
Do not tell anyone that I wake for brief moments

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.720
each day,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.560
including

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.290
your pageboy outside the door.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:34.580
Why did you stay in there

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.830
for so long before coming out?

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:37.780
Did my brother wake up?

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.200
I just figured out...

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.720
You'd figured out how to deal with them?

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.390
Once the Tiemo envoy

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.560
enters Chang'an,

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.500
I will make him disappear

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.040
for one night right under Huben's nose.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.750
During that night,

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.680
you will meet with him.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.540
I?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.350
If Yan Fengshan and the Tiemo can negotiate,

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:04.890
why can't you?

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:08.430
Do not forget.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:12.560
You are the Emperor.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.600
The detailed plan

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.160
will be given to you

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:34.600
after you enter Chang'an.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.910
What?

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.680
Are you scared?

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.350
When the nation is in peril,

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.600
even common folk have a duty.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.290
How could I not?

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.310
I am not afraid.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:53.270
You have improved.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:55.480
Huai'an,

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.600
we just met again.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.270
Do we really need to set off so quickly?

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.420
Can't you rest for one night?

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.390
Gu Yu's life is uncertain.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.830
I must go and find the truth.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.120
There are other arrangements in the city

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.950
that cannot be delayed.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.040
Take these.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.000
You need money

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.350
to buy medicine and salt.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.520
Stop stealing the shopkeeper's salt.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.160
That salt shopkeeper is a good man.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.640
His scale gives sixteen and a half liang to a jin.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.000
He says it is to help those in hardship.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.270
And now I am someone in hardship too.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.230
But once life gets better,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.520
I will repay him for sure.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.390
All right.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:54.910
I am leaving.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.040
Wait.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.040
Look at the time.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:05.910
It is already dark outside.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.390
Going back to Chang'an

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.680
is long and dark on the road.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.560
Take a lantern.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:13.370
Take care.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:19.490
Thanks.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.830
All of you live well.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.680
You are not going back?

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:41.680
No.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:42.830
I am going for a drink.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:44.650
Come on.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:45.930
What?

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.910
You know,

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.680
stealing salt

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.040
is a job that suits you.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:16.710
Wuyang,

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.780
please have mercy.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.270
Wake up quickly please.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:26.910
If you wake up,

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.750
I won't have to go

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.830
to that execution trap Xie Huai'an arranged.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.120
I am begging you. I am really scared.
