00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.930
They'll ask you one day to tell them the story of how the world was saved. They'll

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:09.480
want to know how we found our heroes, and together, fought back. But to tell that story, you

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:19.460
young to remember how green the world was, how light, how full of hope. And how we were too

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.400
blinded by the light of our own happiness to see the darkness buried right under our own feet.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.080
And when it finally came, it had only one purpose to destroy all that was good.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.160
It was men who fought first, because that's what men do. We fought. We bled. We lost.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:10.660
So our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our sisters, they picked up the sword. They put on the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.690
sword. And we beat you.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.500
This world has been broken many times. And the breakers are always different.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.260
Sometimes they come from space, sometimes from underground, sometimes they're human. Sometimes

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.880
animal. Other times, no form at all, a germ, a disease, and energy. But they bring death,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:26.760
always death. A death is always followed by rebirth, destruction by renewal. And that first

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.420
job in 15 years ago, this age old cycle started again. You see, the stitch was always there.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.040
Mother Earth had just buried it deep, deep down, to protect us, to protect our most cherished creations.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.000
And then we cut down the forest, melted the ice, opened up the stitch, and all the breakers out.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.200
A young lady, just who was telling the story here? Okay, we've told the story a million times,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.020
start. I want to code the x-dory. Well, you had one this morning. So, as I was saying,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.160
the destruction of the boreal forest. Codeiac. How we can do maths? Codeiac. How about algebra?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.880
How could some algebra? How about physics? Codeiac! Okay, silence, silence.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:36.520
Shh. Willow wins again. This is the story of how Codeiac took out 100 breakers with one swipe

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:44.900
of his mighty axe. It was just the year after the stitch had opened, and our brave forces were

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:51.400
gathered in Glasgow for their first assault. The nights were long and wet and windy. The only thing

00:07:51.400 --> 00:08:00.520
that kept them going were these stories. My dad is a born storyteller. He says our stories are

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:09.920
as important as our guns, our swords, especially now. Stories give those of us that are still left,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:18.340
hope. They inspire our warriors like my mum to keep fighting.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:34.530
He tells me these things not to scare me, but to remind me that one day they'll need me to tell

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:41.210
the story. The story of how we pulled ourselves away from all this darkness and death and destruction.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.330
And found the lights. They were ready to fight. Were there flowers in the island?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:59.270
Yeah, there are flowers. Thousands of reds and purples, yellows, colors like you and believe.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:15.470
The island is so bright. It was so beautiful. Like heaven, heaven. Don't worry,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:25.830
sounds closer than it really is. Whether animals on the island? Back then, so many.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:36.050
It'd be, maybe they're still there. Bunnies, bunnies, birds and badgers.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.360
All right, pretty girl. I'm gonna go grab some presents.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.440
You mum? Yeah, baby. We have to go wake up.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.620
Make a wish.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.720
Thank you.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.920
Mom, it's beautiful. That is warm. I'm a little bit cold there, I shouldn't eat it.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:11.720
There? Where are we going? Okay, my turn. All right, now I know you're not my way

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.080
But I am 15. Yeah, it's been seen that you've never had a real one. I thought maybe.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:33.360
No, you're so cute. I love him. What is it? That's a dog.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.660
You might have been Travis from the nine block makes them. Proceeds go to veterans.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.290
Maybe someday we'll find you a real one. What is name? Well, he's yours now, you name him.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:12:04.960
It's time now. We'll make five minutes. Yes sir. Well, fill it up. It sounds awesome. Just close,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:13.060
boots, thumbs, okay? Yeah, him too. How long will he be gone? Just fill it up, will I?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:28.590
But does. Is that true, Sally? Is that true, Sally? Is that true, Sally?

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:34.010
Yeah, wow, baby. No, it's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:46.390
Close that stitch, I don't understand. When close is another one, I don't think so. We can't hold the line anymore.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.210
We lost the earth, but tell you, and do hours to come here, come here, come here.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:56.810
Close. You know, we've got 15 veterans in this block alone. We can still fight.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:05.790
You too, you did fight. I can fight again. Listen to me. You get one bite, even a single scrum.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:12.150
You don't look who's talking. It's been 72 hours, so I'm clear. Yeah, I totally am here, and you know.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.570
I want to help that as you may be. It was an icing on the back.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:30.070
You. You know, I just did. Well, that's it, that.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.570
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:14:01.330
Hey, hey, quickslaw. Are there any hybrids? Who's this hybrids? If you don't get your last last, you're going to become one. Go on! Go on!

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.790
Go on! This one's calling to Mercy Bay, right? Yes, ma'am. Get in.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:11.350
I need to write in the front. Leave the convoy. What's you going to get there, okay?

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.370
Well, what? My mum, where are we going? Dad, where are we?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.630
Somebody save. Come on.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.390
Listen up. And it can hurt your wife. He's too much a sneeze. He's too much a cough.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.970
I've seen it happen if it happens to me. I won't pull the trigger myself.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.720
You know, I do his concern and not us.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.800
You don't have time for that shit?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.240
You know, you're not totally immune. You might have a bad job, so you think you are?

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.820
She's right. No one is. We can turn. Sure. Anybody can.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.920
The male brain is simple. Synapse is in straight lines. One language.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.680
The infection burns them out quick. Our synapses are like waves that stretch clear across our

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.060
brains. And cross each other multiple times. We're more complicated.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.800
My bread more complicated. Lady, you are a female teenager. You're a damn near and

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.440
destructible.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.300
Ready to fight. Just like Koleak.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:22.040
What about Koleak? He's not a woman. He's killed over 100 breakers. I'm sure he's got scratched. Koleak can

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:28.340
return. He's part breaker himself. 100 breakers. I heard it was 300. What is it matter

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.460
the number? Point is he did it? His pet bear killed at least 50. Pet bear. Koleak is a bear.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.940
Look at the bloody hair old. You're wrong. The bear is how he got the name. He raised it from

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.300
the cup. He found an anchorage. I died of foot with him. Oh, not it.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.560
By the pattern for every man who said they fought with Koleak. No, it's not a matter.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:56.600
Isn't a Scottish blitz? I heard nobody got out of that one and escaped. No one did.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.700
Koleak has a bear. You never told me that. Doesn't matter. The story is the zone.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.520
There are no bears to fight like one. Like we need to fight to the claw.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.580
The second little Koleak bear is a fight to Koleak.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.160
I come to the family bear. We'll be there soon, my love. Try and get some sleep.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.340
Stay in the trap!

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.670
Go, go!

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.940
Come on, you got you. You okay now?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.940
That was the last of them. Come on. What happened? They were honest.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:24.960
Before we could react, three of them. Get everyone off the road into the forest. It's safer.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.660
Let's go to get out of the road into the forest. Quickly!

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.340
Yeah, everyone off the road!

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:44.020
What? Oh, I got five ten minutes. Everyone's different. I'll stay with you till it's over.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.610
Oh, thank you. Your face!

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:09.360
It's okay. It's human, not break. It's not too far. It must be bears.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.260
It's worth to talk a moment. There's maybe five. We'll get there by dawn.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.740
Can you earn? Why? When I raise?

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.960
Take my guy. No, he's no point. That'll slow him down at best.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.280
Listen to me. Can you make it through this?

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.500
You can't stop. You can be afraid. But you can't let it stop you.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.960
Like what scares you move you forward. You understand?

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.620
I love you, Willon.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.760
I have to stand.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.400
Oh, I have to stand. I have to fight.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.400
You said we were going, you said we had to come. They need me.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.640
You said we? You said we?

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.420
I need me. I need you.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.160
I need you.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:19.320
Hold them back. You go!

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.640
What's with me?

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.580
I'm not that way. He's way. What? What? What? What's out of me to go with them? Move!

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.620
They would you call it?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.380
Keep moving. They're almost there.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:29.560
Have the stories I told you. Back in the day before you were born,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.680
my mom and I would go fishing.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.660
You mean when they were fish? That's what you made those up.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.200
Get that.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.000
That's small, but it's sea worthy.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.360
It's not that small. We could still take a couple of those people with us.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.800
This is our path, not theirs.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.560
But we could help.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.420
Well, this is our path. You and me. We cannot think about anyone else right now, okay?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.500
Come on.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.960
Isn't that how the world breaks?

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.300
Please, under the wall.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.520
Hey!

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.200
Yours? No. No, we're just checking it, looking for food.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.600
It's your book.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.800
Okay, okay. It's our boat and you're going to get me out of here.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.410
Those things are coming. Come on. Get it in the water.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.930
Okay, we're still going to go very far without petrol.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.790
You don't think I'd leave it here with a tank full of gas steel?

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.430
There's someone to steal? No. Motors dry.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.650
So where's the fucking gas?

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.210
It's in the boot of one of the cars around the corner.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.820
Okay, come on. Come on.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.960
Stay here. Stay here. Okay, let's go.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.920
Is it just you? Please, no.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.520
Everyone know what it means. What?

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.300
What it means is just to let's get his.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.220
Not our wives, not our mothers, not our daughters.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.380
When they have turned, it's now biology and attacks the white chromosome.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.960
It's either. That's what it means.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.040
The world went to revenge. I think you wrote a blame.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.080
Something you just can't wash off.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.780
Open it. Open it. Just get in my key.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.280
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.100
What about the man?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.140
He got scared. He ran off. Come on. Help me.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.120
What my come? One, two, three.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.520
What do you say, babe? Do you want to get some breakfast?

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.420
Hold on tight, babe.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.420
I promise that.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.560
Sorry, Mrs. Time. How long he take three?

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.140
You'll see. It's not so bad having just one.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.420
Nothing in the snares?

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.280
I'll come on. You're always happy when those traps are empty.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.140
Need to eat, Willa.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.400
Not just tin beans and scraps from the garden and you need protein.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.420
I'm so deusky, honey.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.160
Black.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.240
I told you that climb is too risky.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.400
It was easy to answer. Don't get cocky young lady. Anything happens to you.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.080
All right, take them aside.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.800
I'll leave them when I'm done.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.060
What's the wood on the fire? The dry stuff of wet stuff is too smoky.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.820
Why do you let me spit the wood sometimes?

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.840
Huh?

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.960
I mean, I can swing an axe like Code Jack taking off a break his head and like you.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.300
Oh yeah, you think so?

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.120
What are you trying me?

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.160
All right, show me.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.180
Come on.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.280
Show me how you swing that sword. You will not let you split the rest.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.080
Come on.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.110
You're not ready, Willa. You need more training.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:06.580
Oh good. Kindly.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.380
Did you see what happened when you first approached me head on like that?

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.720
I painted you past and I came in from behind and gave myself the advantage.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.300
Understand?

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.820
Come on. I'll call you another.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.700
Maybe some of this fire wouldn't, okay?

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.640
That show tonight only. Turn egg omelette.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.020
French green beans. Get it while you can.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.620
What are you doing?

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.820
I like the way that she did it.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.280
Can you help me?

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.180
Okay, okay.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.120
Did she teach you?

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.460
No. I had to learn. I'm watching how I do it.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.060
Just like you're not in watching me.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.790
The hunt to run, to climb, to fight, to survive.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.170
And when this war is over, you'll get to learn the rest.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.410
What's the rest?

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.070
To live.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.590
How shall she know where I look like now?

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.690
Oh, well. It's only been a year.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.490
Only. She could pass me on the street and she won't recognize me.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.070
I think you're over estimating.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.750
Do you think she's met Kodiak?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.330
Sure. Of course. Why not?

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.650
She was Kodiak, she's safe.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.150
Okay.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.810
How is it?

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.630
Looks just like how she did it.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.850
Can we eat?

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.580
Okay, just one. And then you eat.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.780
Okay, just one story and then we eat.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.400
This is the story of when Kodiak was way up north.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.420
He was collecting firewood for the long, cold winter ahead.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.980
Now remember, for Kodiak, gathering firewood is not like what we do picking up sticks and

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:57.020
drift with no one. He could take down an entire tree with his axe and entire forest.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.590
Now with every blow of that mighty axe,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.890
I know it would run most with a sky.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.530
You only made that axe himself.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.580
We carved the handle from an English oak that had been hit by lightning.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.390
Forged it from steel, from an old Welsh mining ground.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.580
Time and hard, indestructible.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.450
A day, he was heading back to his camp.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.600
He heard something, something no one had ever heard before.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.330
He was the first to see it, the stitch,

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.760
and crawl and out of it.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.400
Break yes.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.160
But he wasn't scared.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.700
No, obviously wasn't scared.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.800
He was ready to fight.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.720
Yes, he finally did.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.480
I need to gather 100 breakers with one swipe of his mighty axe.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.920
Well, it was one breaker, actually.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.540
But it was the first.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.680
Many more came after we know that.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:22.020
But this was the first and this is how we learned that to kill them.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.460
You have to take off his hands.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.140
Dika, are you ready to do it?

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.420
Not the only way.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.520
The fastest bullets work, but they're not as effective.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.760
Slows them down, but it doesn't kill them at the end.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.780
Time for dinner.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.200
These stories.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.640
Yeah?

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.140
About cardiac.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.500
You know them so well.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.620
Where every parent does.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.080
Are you sure?

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.040
What?

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.400
He's not you.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.360
We're not.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.980
Well, it sounds like you. Strong, powerful.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.820
This is an axe.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.820
Oh, please, go on.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.320
Go on.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.180
Where an eye ford.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.720
We would go into battle knowing there was a giant out there

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.360
where an axe made of lightning,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.900
slicing through breakers like a hot knife through butter.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.820
Cardiac gives us hope.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.840
If he could stand tall, if he could save this world from breaking.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.020
Maybe you could.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.240
Because he's totally you.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:32.960
Well,

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.380
these stories are important.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.940
We need to keep telling them how the stitch opened,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.460
how the first breakers came then the hybrids and how we stood tall.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.580
How we fought back, found our heroes.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.720
And one day,

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.420
when this world is bright and green and alive again,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.560
we will go back.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.240
Believe her?

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.600
Oh, yes, I do.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.460
Because when I look at you,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.440
and then mine did.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.240
Well,

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:18.720
hope.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.020
Now, I'll have your dinner.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.670
Pause here.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.950
Oh,

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:08.810
Stix is warmer.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.790
No, she doesn't have furlates.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.040
This is fighting, but where is he?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.000
Not so peaceful.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.460
They can't see us coming.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.860
No, they don't see like we do.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.780
I don't think they have eyes.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.140
I think I've other senses once we don't have.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.500
The hybrids are the breakers used them as their eyes and ears,

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.600
kind of like they're connected somehow.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.860
You know, brains are braiding.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.300
But they don't know where, here, right, on this island.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.240
If they did my love, they wouldn't be on this island.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.500
What about the landlines?

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.180
Just a precaution.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.760
Just don't be breakers.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.640
Just stop anyone.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.120
You know, it's up. You're going to need your energy.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.580
Why did they want to hear us? If we didn't do anything to them?

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.380
Remember our lessons about insects and

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.680
I'm going to kill the wasp. We're trying to invade there until.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:45.460
Yeah.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.280
Oh, maybe it's like that.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.080
They think we're like the wasp.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.700
Trying to invade their home.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.780
So they eliminate the threat.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:53.660
Us.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.920
It's our home, too.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.830
Not it is. That it is.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.650
We're going to be ready to fight for it.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.360
Are you ready to fight?

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.250
I got...

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.580
33 seconds.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.940
Can't you hear them? The breakers are coming.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.240
What are you doing here, my horn?

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.220
Get to the cottage.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.720
28 seconds.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.360
Which direction is the cottage from the white cliffs?

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:25.740
No.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:26.900
How far?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.120
We're both miles.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.100
Faster than I could come on.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.740
Don't shoot breakers.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.460
The hybrids are coming.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.560
They're coming for you little dog.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.200
Save me, will I? Save me.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:45.860
59.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.140
Thanks to directions to the bunkers.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.480
No, no.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.580
They're behind you.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.680
Come on.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.880
Come on. Almost there.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.260
In a tent.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.540
How do you kill a breaker?

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.860
How do you kill a breaker?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.380
Oh, decab. Show me.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.560
And a hybrin?

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:12.720
Decab.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.080
No, not enough.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.340
Brains.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.920
No, not 22.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.200
It's not bad.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.960
But you could do better.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.760
You'll act my good.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:31.880
What are you about?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:34.960
Okay.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.200
Oh, no.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.460
On your mark.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.460
Get set.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.100
Come on, nugget!

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.590
You're a ward.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.710
Dying?

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.910
For not quitting.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.510
Oh, bug is it?

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.890
Oh, I wish it were.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.490
More protein.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.150
What are they?

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:46.250
Strawberries.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:47.830
Trivan.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.050
I think I've always grown wild here.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.750
It's just assumed they died out with everything else.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.170
It's silent, it's special.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.030
Somehow, they're still holding on.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.110
Spit them.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.850
No.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.370
You have them all.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.770
I've tried them before.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.790
No, not there.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:06.790
Just the red bit.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:19.290
Yeah.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:22.530
Uh.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.130
I still have precious.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.070
It's to be a lot more of them back in the old days.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.650
Strawberries?

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.710
Places.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.310
Your mum.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.190
When we got married, just before you were born before the stitch.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:44.290
All she wanted for the wedding party was strawberry, shortcake.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.070
What is stupid, okay?

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:52.110
It's a yellow cake, sweet whipped cream, and dozens of the house.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.930
dozens?

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.090
Did she like them?

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.050
Like them?

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.410
She ate the whole damn cake.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:04.930
Didn't even come for anyone else.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:08.890
She was the...

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.840
She is the life of the party.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.960
Always has been.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.780
That she loves strawberries.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:21.920
Like you do, apparently.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.100
I can't believe it doesn't think I'm ready yet.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.040
Yeah, just don't worry about her.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.180
To fight.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.920
To fight like mum fights.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.360
You don't know.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.740
He just thinks that I can't do or he did to that man.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.060
But I could fight.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:13.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.300
He's okay, he just...

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.540
Okay, no, you're fine.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.120
You're okay, just don't move.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.920
I take his step back, okay? I just...

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.360
He's like my legs.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.380
Okay, you did you want?

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:29.560
Okay.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.520
I'm too...

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.760
Okay, okay, don't move.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.880
Let's get back from this.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.000
Okay, um...

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.240
Okay, you're okay.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.380
Do you want to tell me what happened?

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.240
Are you alone?

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.560
Is someone out there?

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.640
Is anybody over there?

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.700
No, it's fine, okay.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.180
Uh... no, okay, you know what, I'm gonna...

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.120
I'm gonna take you someplace more.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.960
Let's... let's go to this one.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.580
Okay, just a little further.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.030
Stay right here.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.990
Let's get you warmed up.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.300
Here you go.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.640
Drink something.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.000
He must be thirsty.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.760
Are you bleeding?

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.520
Just hit my head on the boat.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.700
What boat?

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.920
We were headed up the coast to my grandma's house.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.520
He said it'd be safe for there.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.320
Something came up from below.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.500
Just over.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.120
A dad, a brother.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.100
We all went in the water.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.200
We didn't know they could swim and I was big.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.140
Okay, okay, now.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.340
I'm willing.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.960
I was your name.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:42.660
Gross.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:48.870
Did everyone ask me about it?

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.210
It's the last time you ate Rosie.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:56.010
Okay.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.890
This is what I have left.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.810
I'm going to go and get you some real food, okay?

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:11.330
No.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.370
It's okay, you need to eat.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:14.350
You need protein.

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.890
You have to do as make sure the fight keeps going.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:17.830
I can't.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.990
We have to do as put a log on and make sure it doesn't die.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.260
Please don't leave.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:26.170
Okay.

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:29.750
I'll stay.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.180
You're free this longer.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.620
Where are you going?

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.100
You're game.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.180
You're game.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.650
You don't have much time. Let's go.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.730
They're waiting at the bus.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.810
Mom, we need to go now. There's no time.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.150
But what about Dad? We can't just leave.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.410
Dad, we need to get him.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.750
We need soldiers. We're warriors like you.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.590
You can't fight anymore. You can.

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.690
Mom, what's wrong? Aren't you ready?

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.690
I... I told you.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.790
I'm sorry.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.790
We're not... don't leave me, you know?

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.860
No matter how bad you ask, we may be.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.110
You've been gone all day.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:56.050
I got scoured the island. I blew the horn. Didn't you hear it?

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:58.030
It was... I fast deep in the pangrove.

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.310
Because of all the trailing. I'm sorry.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:02.170
Oh, my God.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.930
Sit down. Make you some food.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.900
You might have noticed it's not easy surviving out here.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.980
The tin fruit has gone. The garden has spent.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.620
We are living on fumes, well.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.660
We have to be careful. We have to be smart.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.540
That gun. It was that man's, wasn't it?

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:53.550
We left a wrong behind that night we came here.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:55.570
Did never choice, not that night.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.710
Mom did.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.530
What?

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:01.110
Had a choice?

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.450
Could you choose to leave us?

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.850
I'm had to leave. To save the world and I had to save you.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.390
Are you all bad?

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:15.950
What?

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:24.250
And then, are you all bad? Because you can turn and we got?

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:26.990
No, I'm not.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.450
Of course not.

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.550
Not all men are bad.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.370
And girls can turn, too, remember.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:39.490
It's just less likely.

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.930
Baby, kill breakers.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.170
Of course. I told you the stories.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.030
When it comes to it, if it comes to it, you will too.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:50.770
Hi, Brits.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:57.690
Yes, but it's not so easy. They will want us.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.810
Would you kill a person?

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.700
If they threatened you or mom, in any way?

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.300
Yes, I would.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:16.560
Right.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.880
You need to eat some soup.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:13.200
Okay, slow down. I don't have many of those. It's better to save me.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.060
Do you live here?

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.580
Oh, no. I just let me have some time to get away.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.560
It's like a girl cave.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.880
Are you alone? Like me?

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.160
Yeah.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:39.430
Where do you live? Really?

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:42.230
Come.

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:44.270
You want to see something?

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:45.850
Sure.

00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:55.810
This is what the world used to look like for the stitch opened.

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:13.810
Okay, one looks so happy.

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.870
Yeah.

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.930
It is.

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.170
I dad said he's a good fish.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.550
Fish?

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.200
What are these?

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.140
I don't know.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.760
He's sort of like breakers.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.420
The ones that they were flowers back then.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.780
Thousands of colors you've never seen.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.840
Everything is alive.

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.700
The world is bright and beautiful.

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.900
I miss my dad and my brother.

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.320
It's okay. It's okay.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.340
Hopefully out there right now, looking for you.

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:16.800
What's his name?

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.480
Bear.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.600
He's a dog.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:25.520
He's a dog, but I call him Bear because he fights a codiac.

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:27.960
A codiac is dead.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.280
What?

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.960
Well, if he were alive, he could do all the things they say.

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.820
We don't want by now.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:47.510
He can't do it on his own.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:49.810
He needs a help too.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.320
Do you like stories?

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:11.290
This is the story about codiac and the first battle breakers.

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:19.570
It was after the first stage opened and already codiac was a leader among men.

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:29.970
codiac and the men slayed every single breaker that came at them.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:37.720
We thought we were on the battle.

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.520
This is when they realized that breakers weren't only enemy.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.900
We were also fighting with ourselves.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.130
So, codiac killed the first hybrid.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.350
Yep. And he told us how to do it.

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:22.230
I've got to mush the brains.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:24.030
I think I'll stop them.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.250
That's right.

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.230
It's a good year, it's not dead.

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:34.750
He's out there fighting for us and with us.

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:37.190
And together we're going to close that stitch.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:39.410
And the world won't be broken anymore.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:41.450
You'll see.

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.570
And then I go, I'll be back soon with some more food.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:47.890
Will you be okay?

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.550
This is for you.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:53.890
I'll keep you warm.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.050
When can I leave?

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.430
Soon.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.420
Come on!

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.780
30-3 seconds, faster!

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.600
That's one yet!

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.540
Come on, now get hit it!

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.340
Stay on that log.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.320
Focus! Keep going!

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.000
Come on!

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.400
That's my girl!

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.340
Keep a bit of this! Come on, Willah!

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.040
It's under a minute!

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.500
Keep going!

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.760
It's your best time yet.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.840
What are you thinking about?

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.160
The break is a hybrid.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.340
Just kill them!

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.540
Good.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.500
You just take up four breakers.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.000
Now...

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:14.900
Now...

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.600
There's a hybrid coming.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.740
I take you. They take you. They take you.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.280
It's not mud.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.880
Come on!

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.400
Come on, then.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.960
Daddy, you okay?

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120
I'm not your daddy!

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.100
Do you need help?

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:52.800
Hi, Brit!

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.500
Hi, Brit! Don't!

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:02.640
I didn't want to save you, little pig!

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.980
Come out! Come out! Wherever you!

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.010
Dad!

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:40.490
Are you okay?

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:54.990
Give me my stack or you.

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.630
Okay.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.440
You might have some soup, okay?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:21.580
No.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.040
Dad.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.880
I'm fine.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.500
You're not eating.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.860
Of course I'm eating.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:30.680
No.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.680
You're not eating, so I can eat.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.800
Well, we have to keep rationing until she comes.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.220
You know what if she doesn't?

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.800
Don't say that.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.860
What if they lose the war?

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.100
Then you would have kept me here for what?

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:49.900
For nothing.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.760
Not nothing.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.120
I'm just supposed to stay here,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.400
carrying around rocks, swinging about a wooden sword,

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:59.040
training me for a war you won't even let me fight.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.760
I am not just training you to fight, will I?

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.000
I'm training you to live.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.120
How is this living?

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.660
This is like a prison.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.480
We stay here and do nothing.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.720
What's other mothers?

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:17.730
Five years.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:21.650
Five years, I fought.

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:25.970
And your mother is still out there fighting.

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.790
We lost everything, will I?

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:31.570
Everything.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.200
Don't ever say we did nothing.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:54.960
I'm sorry.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.300
She loved you very much.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.700
Then why isn't she here?

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:35.770
I promised your mom.

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.890
I wouldn't give this to you until you were ready.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:44.770
Yesterday, you proved that.

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:51.330
This was mine.

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:55.110
And now it's yours.

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:18.990
I will show you how to fight like she does.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.600
I'm going to go check the rabbit slers.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.280
Great.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.700
Rabbit's due for lunch, then.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.840
I'm back.

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:20.410
Happy like Sardine.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.220
Oh, I want to see.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:37.640
No.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.020
Rosie?

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.740
Rosie, why would you do this to bear?

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:01.500
Rosie?

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:07.830
But you're okay.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:13.580
Let go. Come on.

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.130
You look at you.

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:22.590
Did it hurt?

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:24.290
Are you scratched?

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:25.110
What did it hurt?

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.350
What did I do?

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.770
What did I do?

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:31.870
Listen to me.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:32.870
Listen to me.

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:34.250
None of that matters now.

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.530
It called out to them.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:37.630
It's signal to them.

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:38.610
You remember what I told you?

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:40.210
The breakers and the hybrids, they are connected.

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:42.670
They know we are here now, so we leave.

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:44.730
What were we going?

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:46.350
But go.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:50.880
Hey.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.360
This is what you're trying for, Willa.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.060
The breakers are coming and they will destroy everything here

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.140
and it looks like they are.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.200
We're going back.

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.800
We're going home.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:01.300
No.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.400
We've got someone.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.220
And it's just not here.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.640
Dad, I'm scared.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.300
You and that, what scares you?

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.120
Of you, for what?

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:14.840
Remember?

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:23.190
We're on the wrong side of the island.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:24.990
Along the hike up and over to the other side.

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:26.910
You never told me they could swim.

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:28.130
The predator's well.

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:30.390
When they say it's praying, nothing's going to stop.

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.450
And we're going to go.

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:41.190
I'd like to come ashore on the beach because it's less rocky.

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:43.190
The mind should sort them down a bit.

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:44.650
You have a time to get to the coast.

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.190
We're still moving.

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:48.390
You have those explosions and means we don't have a lot of time.

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:49.990
10, 15 minutes of most.

01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:51.590
But we get to the boat.

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.950
What are we going to go?

01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.430
South.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:55.330
Keep the main land to the left.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:56.870
And we keep going.

01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.610
South is our safest land.

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:07.900
No.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.240
My leg.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.020
Let's just rest here.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.580
Just for a bit.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.540
Why are you doing fine?

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.300
Once we're through the prime forest,

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.180
another five minutes down into the coast.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.380
Where's your head?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.440
I gave it to her.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.140
Now I was just trying to help.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:39.050
God.

01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:40.610
God is on my phone.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:41.850
Now.

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.770
This world.

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:44.930
What's happened?

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:45.990
None of it is your fault.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:46.450
You understand?

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:48.110
Yeah.

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:49.190
And what happened to that girl?

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:50.270
It wasn't her fault either.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:52.630
It just happened.

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:54.930
Yeah.

01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:57.390
Eat this.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.230
I'll keep you warm.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.330
Five minutes and we go.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.140
Do you want a story?

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.200
No.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:11.620
No.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.420
Who are you?

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.900
What if you don't with my daughter?

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.580
Not like the others.

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.520
Not a courteous story.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.620
I went from the floor.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.500
The floor?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.480
The story without?

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.480
That was how to tell.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.560
So why you need to tell them?

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.260
Already they were wrong.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.400
They were going to be wrong.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.440
These are the awful things happening up north.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.420
Entire towns ravaged.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.360
People slaughtered by an enemy we did not yet understand.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.900
But we didn't care about any of it.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.020
We were happy.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.760
I never met anyone with so much light.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.820
So much love.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:36.080
We knew that no matter what should come, we had each other, and we couldn't wait to bring

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:48.570
you into this world. And when you finally came, this little lamb, suffering of trust and

01:14:48.570 --> 01:15:04.260
under, he didn't pray, he didn't scream, he hadn't no fear, just for that small amount of moments.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:31.500
Don't break up. You told me it was going to be hard. What a nice of you told me hard.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.540
I know that you're out there. I know that you're coming back.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:43.920
Please, if you can make it to the run.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.880
Back to me.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.560
Help me.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.840
Save her.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:11.140
There. We go back.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.080
It's no fun. It's keep this way.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.180
We'll be there soon.

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.800
Here we go. Go, go. Through there.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:24.920
You did this?

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.240
What?

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.800
You didn't go to the only one who can chop down a tree with a single blow.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.660
The breakers aren't big enough to get across this. They'll have to go around, which should buy us a few minutes.

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.520
Unless we can't get over it.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.580
Come on, maggot. You first work the plank.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.660
You've done this a million times. Come on.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:44.800
Eyes on the tree.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.580
Are you ready? Focus on the front?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:49.600
Focus?

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.920
Okay.

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.040
Please, okay?

01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.740
No, stay there.

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:39.690
That's the brains. Remember?

01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:42.410
That was a brother.

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:45.530
Any bites? Scratches? Any blood?

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:48.110
Good. Go. Go.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.720
Can you make it? Can you get over it?

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.800
Hey. Who trained him?

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.000
Come on, get up.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:12.980
Get up.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.200
Get up.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:13.920
Get up.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:14.060
Get up.

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:42.440
I'm going to get up now.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.560
Get up.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.820
I can't.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.900
You could do this.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.840
This is what you're trained for.

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.060
You could do this.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:32.970
I can't help you.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.580
I can't help you.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.020
She's still there.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.580
I cannot help you, darling.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.000
You remember how to prime and start the motor like I showed you?

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.640
I guess?

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.100
You guess? You do what you don't.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.660
Yes, I do.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.080
You cut the moring rope.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.020
It's just one swipe, it's just slide down on it.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.340
It's only one even need to push it.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.940
Dad, you come on.

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.930
No.

01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.870
No.

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:41.550
You said to me.

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:46.750
I don't give you as much time as I can, so you can get to the boat and go.

01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:48.150
I will hold them off.

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:49.890
No, I can't stand. I'm going to fight.

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:51.410
I know you could fight.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:54.330
You've already proved that to me, not today.

01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:55.830
Not now.

01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:01.750
Let me do this for you.

01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:07.510
You are a warrior will.

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:09.610
So you fight.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.510
But don't forget to love.

01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:13.070
You can love it all.

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:14.630
Leave it to darkness.

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:17.770
This world is so broken.

01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:19.610
I can't do it.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:20.710
The world is a broken world.

01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:23.290
It has ruined it.

01:21:32.170 --> 01:21:32.770
Go.

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.170
Please, go.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:35.170
Go.

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:36.170
Will it go?

01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:42.210
One swipe of the shot!

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.560
No.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:50.780
No!

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:12.920
I'm sorry.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.220
I'm sorry.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:29.180
They asked you one day to tell them the story.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.060
Of how the world was saved.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.530
And you tell them.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.900
It was a girl named Willer, who was strong, full of hope and fear.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.460
Willer was scared of what was to come.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.540
But she was ready.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.140
Because like in all good stories,

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.480
Willer had a hero.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:06.240
And when they want to know if Kodiak is just a story, you'll tell them.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:09.300
Kodiak is real.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:13.740
The hero who gave Willer hope.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.680
The hero who gives all of us hope.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.660
Come on, man.

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:07.770
This will be the story of how the world didn't break.
