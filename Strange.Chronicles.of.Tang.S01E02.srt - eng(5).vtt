00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.990
Correct.

It was discovered

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.350

with an unclear provenance.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.640
It appears to have been written

by someone pleading for help
in a moment of crisis.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.280

leans heavily towards "You".

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240
"Xia" is a remote possibility,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.970
but exceedingly slim.

If the preceding character is "Xie",
the surname,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.329
then the two characters together

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.960
should be read as "Xie You."

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.560
If it's not a surname,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.430
then the phrase
would simply mean "Relief-from-Woes."

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.810
Better rent soon.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.360
More and more people are coming

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.390
into the district

prices are about to go up.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.720
Exactly.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.730
I'm not here to rent.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.850
May I ask you three ladies—

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.000
does the person

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.550
who lived here go by the name Xie You?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.240
Oh, not a tenant—

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.150
you're looking for Scholar Xie.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.080
He…

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.600
has already moved away.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.530
Do you recall when exactly he left?

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.020
About 3 or 4 months ago.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.730
Could you be more specific?

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.480
Young man,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.770
there's no need to be so fierce.

[Yongzhou Prefecture
Command Authority]

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
This is an official investigation!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.030
A blood letter pleading for help

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.150
was found in a robe sold

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.530
at a secondhand shop.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.480
It may have been written

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.890
by this Scholar Xie.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.600
Do you know

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600
where he moved to?

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.360
A plea for help…

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.440
in blood?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.150
Why—is something wrong?

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.960
Well…

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.600
we neighbors

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.120
find it hard to believe.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.390
How could anything
have happened to him?

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.320
He was such a kind person.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.070
Exactly.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.150
He's a scholar of such standing,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.510
yet not arrogant in the least.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.120
Right,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.670
he often helped us with chores

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.080
and even wrote poetry for me.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.210
We often made him delicious meals too.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.000
He was from Nanzhou Prefecture,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.320
and had a fondness for mushrooms.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.840
This year, for his birthday,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.360
we made a special trip to Leyouyuan

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.130
to gather some

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.860
and prepare a soup just for him.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.240
For his birthday?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.210
It sounds like you were all

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.330
on very good terms.

please have some tea.

I mentioned earlier?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.720
Of course—

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.720
how could I not know a candidate scholar

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.780
in my own district?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.150
What if he places high one day?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.000
Wouldn't it be too late

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.330
to get acquainted then?

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.690
That makes sense.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.000
What kind of person was he?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.090
A good man.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.200
[Li Changgeng. Head of Xiuzhen District]

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.860
Otherwise,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.130
why would they call him "Woe-Reliever"?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.780
What does "Woe-Reliever" mean?

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.840
Well,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.510
even though he was a tenant,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.150
he was

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.200
warm-hearted

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.090
and loved helping others.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.750
So the women

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.600
in the neighborhood

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.600
gave him that nickname.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.090
The women in the neighborhood?

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.030
I met some today.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.850
Scholar Xie

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.340
rented Manniang's house.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.870
And—coincidentally—

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.870
all the neighbors

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.120
around that house

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.250
were widowed women.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.600
Scholar Xie

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.200
often helped them write letters,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.190
compose poems,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.270
sometimes

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.920
even did heavy work for them.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.390
But when it came to the dirtier,
tougher tasks,

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.250
the neighbors wouldn't let him
overexert himself.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.880
So yes, you might say

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.820
he was a good man—to them.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.590
But as for me…

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.840
What?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.110
He wasn't respectful to you
as the district chief?

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.770
Oh, he was respectful enough—

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.120
but he made a fool of me

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.560
and left me in an awkward position.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.630
Could you explain in detail?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.720
Well,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.230
he once asked me

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.730
to help him find a diviner,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.150
to see if he might succeed

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.890
in the next year's exams.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.120
So I brought him

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.910
the best diviner

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.150
west

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200
of Zhuque Avenue.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.510
The diviner told him
he would pass with flying colors.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.840
He was so overjoyed

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.360
he practically danced on the spot

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.740
and arranged a feast

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.870
to thank me

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.320
and the diviner on his birthday.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.870
hen he vanished—

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.030
cleared out without a word.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.840
And that diviner

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.640
held me to the promise of a feast!

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720
I was out of pocket

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.270
for the whole affair.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.600
His birthday?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.320
He moved away before his birthday?

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.310
That's right.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.490
Xue Huan!

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.560
I heard it—

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.250
the timing doesn't match.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320
What's your move?

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:35.600
Take them in.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.000

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.320
Quick, get me out

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.090
of this cage—

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.600
let me walk around a bit.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.200
I was in the wrong yesterday,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.210
but it's not that I didn't want to try—

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.770
I was just too tired.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.310
Don't punish me anymore.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.730
Let me out of the cage

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.100
and let me rest in bed
for a couple of days.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.480
Once I've recovered my energy,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.240
I promise I'll…

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.040
Promise what?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.150
Promise to be good to her, is that it?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.210
Then what about me?

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.440

Perfect—

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.630
please, I beg you, let me go.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.240

you wrote the plea in blood,

[Xie You, Scholar Candidate]

how exactly did you manage

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.200
to get that blood letter out?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.000
Now that all three of us are here,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.850
speak up.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.670

deliver it?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.230
Tell us,

No, no—

I don't know anything
about a blood letter.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.870
When did I ever
write a blood letter?
