[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.910
[Episode 8]

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.640
You've drawn the eyes quite accurately.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.070
But Chen Shubao's eyebrows

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.130
aren't this short.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.880
Alright. I'll redraw them

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.660
and let you review them again.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.070
Master!

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.510
Something terrible has happened!

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.240
It's Mr. Fei.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.680
Mr. Fei is in trouble!

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.039
This is how it happened.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.640
Two ghosts

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.480
took Mr. Fei away

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.610
right in front of us.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.650
Official Lu,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
please save him quickly!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.070
Yeah,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.920
Official Lu, please hurry and save him!

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.070
A woman in red clothes
wearing a white face veil

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590
and a man in black with his face covered.
Is that right?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.320
-Yes, that's right.
-Yes, yes.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.110
They must be the same killers
from that day

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.039
in Ascension Forest
in the Xiuzhen District

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.200
who ambushed Wuming and Yingtao.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.039
What they witnessed

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.640
matches Yingtao's account.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:37.350
Xijun,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289
stay here to draw the portrait.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.140
Xue Huan, Jia, Luo, Liu,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.280
take all available men

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
from Yongzhou Prefecture

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.759
with us

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.789
to search the entire city
for Mr. Fei's whereabouts.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.450
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.570
Lu Lingfeng,

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.289
will Master Fei be alright?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.870
I really wonder

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.070
what these Ghost Birds do at night

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.640
and what they eat to survive.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.040
Also,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.790
about those 2 assassins,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.960
I believe that day,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.950
they weren't

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.680
following me here.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.910
Rather, we encountered them here.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.750
You mean...

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.360
They're still in the forest even now.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.840
Ascension Forest.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.240
Old drunkard,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.260
do you still recognize us?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.870
He won't remember.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.360
We were too young back then.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.310
With you two making me
hang upside down like this,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.270
I really can't recognize you.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.960
Since we're old acquaintances,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.710
why not let me down first?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.520
If there's any misunderstanding,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.750
you can let me explain.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.280
If it's money you want,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.800
I can give you everything I have.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.210
And you still want to live?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.140
This is Ascension Forest.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.420
Your feet point to the heavens

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.930
and your head to the earth.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.960
You haven't forgotten

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170
this way of punishing traitors, have you?

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.190
A-Ascension Forest?

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.940
Traitors?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.130
Fei Yingjun,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.590
you helped the officials set a trap

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.650
to harm our mentor.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.120
Tonight

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.710
is your death day.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.120
I remember now.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.430
You are

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.870
the disciples of Silent Ember,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.320
Wu Zhu and Chi Zhen.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.470
[Chi Zhen, Disciple of Silent Ember]

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.360
Thanks to you,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.310
[Wu Zhu, Disciple of Silent Ember]

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.710
we can no longer contact
our assassin group.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.370
Therefore,

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.430
our code names are useless now.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.840
So,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.240
you two were the ones who tried
to assassinate Su Wuming that day,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.030
weren't you?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.150
We wanted to kill him

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.670
to avenge our mentor.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.490
But unexpectedly,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.079
the woman by his side
was truly formidable.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.240
We weren't about to fight her
to the death.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.640
Today, after killing you

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.280
to avenge our master,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
my wife and I

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.480
will leave Chang'an.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.120
Then the assassins Wu Zhu and Chi Zhen

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
will no longer exist in the martial world.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.470
There will only be

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.560
carefree Zeigong and Zeipo living happily.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.600
When your blood

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.580
is about to drain completely,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920
Ghost Birds will send you to heaven.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.030
By tomorrow morning,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.310
not even your bones will remain.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.630
For the sake of me

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.430
treating your wounds back then,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.540
please let me down!

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.830
Spare my life!

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.440
I still have plenty of living to do!

3 days have passed,

arrives as scheduled.

Though worldly affairs are complex,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.630
they follow certain rules.

Life is full of suffering,

but there is always a way
to relieve one's woes.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.560
Today, the deity descends again,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360
dwelling within Master's body,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.409
to remove all woes for you

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.390
and deliver salvation to all beings.

as usual,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.950
will select from among the confessors

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.920
the most miserable one.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.480
The chosen one,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.700
according to tradition,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.870
will slay this month's Demon of Woes.

who are you brazen villains?

State your names and face execution!

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.960
We have no name,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.790
and we're punishing a traitor.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.150
This doesn't concern outsiders.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.430
Please do us the favor of leaving.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.750
You're taking a life,

yet you speak so righteously.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.080
How absurd!

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.630
I know your martial skills are superior.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.720
We didn't want to fight to the death,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.400
but unfortunately,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.770
the punishment ritual has already begun

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.040

turn over the wooden tablet
in front of you.

for giving me this chance
to relieve my woes.

On that Lantern Festival,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.840
I secretly cut a piece
from a gold-threaded skirt

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.100
to make him a headband.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.520
With his cane in hand,

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.440
my father chased me
all the way to the Qu River.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.030
I said

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.600
if I wasn't beaten to death,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.550
I would become his wife.

In the early days after my marriage,

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.390
when I set up

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.550
my sesame flatbread stall
in the East Market,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.120
the sun had just reached the corner tower
of the Yongchong District.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.910
I saved every copper coin.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.000
He said

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.280
he would make me a plain silver hairpin.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.360
I thought it was too expensive.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.840
For 10 years,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.030
whether it was heavy snow

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.080
or pouring rain,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.790
the charcoal fire at my flatbread stall

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.360
never went out.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.550
We

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.870
finally had our own shop.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.390
But he

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.080
got drunk every night
in the Pingkang District

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.670
and refused to come home.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.960
I thought my husband worked hard outside.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.390
If the pleasure houses
could relieve his woes,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.550
then so be it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.200
So I let him be.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120
Three years ago,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.640
he said silk prices in Luoyang were good

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.580
and wanted to take all our savings

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.390
to trade in silk.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.360
He also said
that after he made this big deal,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.840
I would never again have to

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.750
sell flatbread at a stall.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.350
Fearing he didn't have enough capital,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.620
I pawned our shop and old house

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.030
to the pawnshop.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.240
I even gave him

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.790
the sheep fat jade pendant

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.760
that my mother had given me
on her deathbed.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.630
Now,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.200
900 days have passed.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.870
Every day at Chunming Gate,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.200
I gazed eastward,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.770
waiting for his return.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.320
Waiting and waiting.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.750
But all I received

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:01.910
was a unilateral repudiation letter
sent from Luoyang.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.200
How tragic.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:21.750
Tragic.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.080
After both my parents passed away,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.390
my child was kidnapped.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.550
I blamed my wife
for not watching carefully,

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.960
but she blamed me for not having money
to hire a housekeeper.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960
I was so angry

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.480
that I slapped her.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.730
Then she ran off with a butcher
from the back street.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.360
Later, I found out

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.320
that they'd been having an affair
for a long time.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.840
I became

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.170
a lonely, desolate man.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.430
But I knew I couldn't sink into despair.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.630
So I sold my ancestral home,

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.080
and together with a friend,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.150
rented a shop

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.020
and started a spice business.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.850
At first, we really made money.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.670
But soon,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080
the court decided to increase taxes.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.010
My friend didn't want to pay taxes,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.980
so he tampered with the accounts.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.540
As a result, we were caught

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.380
and fined 3 times the tax amount!

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.630
In this case,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.120
all our assets

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.840
were gone in fines!

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.320
And I was left with a mountain of debt.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.610
My friend refused to bear the debt,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.960
so he took all the spices

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.550
from the shop and ran away.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.870
I wanted to run too,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.750
but I was caught and beaten badly.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.960
Now, I have nothing left,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.370
and my body has also been crippled.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.270
Fortunate to have this chance to speak

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.350
and find relief from my woes.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.440
Thank you, all-powerful Master.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.790
How tragic.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.670
Tragic.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.790
The one with the wooden tablet numbered 3

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.750
may come up and speak.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.819
