[♪ theme music playing]

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.665
FOUR DAYS PASSED AFTER BEING DISCHARGED

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:32.933
[doorbell chiming]

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:38.405
IN FRONT OF JIMIN'S HOUSE

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.474
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.009
Can you tell me the passcode?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.343
LIFELINE CALL

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.679
HE CAN'T HELP BUT DANCE
TO THE DOORBELL SOUND

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.582
What if his mom doesn't know
the password either?

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.418
-[man 1] She knows it.
-[woman 1] She comes and goes often.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.421
Wow, Jimin's going to be really surprised.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:58.258
-You can put this mic on Jimin.
-[Jung Kook] Right away?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.160
I'm heading in now.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.063
-If he tells me to come in...
-Yes.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.264
JUNG KOOK WALKS IN

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.332
[Jung Kook] Jimin.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.734
Jimin.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.770
THE YOUNGER ONE IS LOOKING FOR HIM

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.205
Jimin, why aren't you getting up?
Where are you?

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:17.110
FOOTAGE FROM SEASON 1 IS BEING SHOWN
SINCE THERE'S NO CAMERA SET UP HERE

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.880
Jimin, time for Are You Sure?!.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.448
[laughing]

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.850
-Is that Jung Kook?
-Yes.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.287
-Is that you, Jung Kook?
-Yup, it's me.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.522
[laughing]

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:31.058
-Is that a mic?
-Yeah.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.192
MIC BEING CLIPPED ON

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.262
-Is there a camera outside?
-They're coming in now.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.064
[Jimin] I'm literally naked right now.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.166
[Jung Kook] So? You've always been.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.336
-[Jimin] That's true.
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.973
PRODUCTION STAFF ENTERS WITH PERMISSION

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.975
We're filming like this?

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:52.079
FINALLY MEETING THE OFF-DUTY JIMIN
IN HIS NATURAL HABITAT

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.880
Okay, take the mic first.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.083
[laughing]

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.320
Are you really just filming me like this?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:08.562
HE NEEDS SOME ALONE TIME

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.531
WAKING UP

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.237
I'll come out after I get dressed.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.041
-I'll wait outside.
-Can I come out after I get dressed?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.977
Oh man, this is hilarious.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.580
Wow, so this is how it works.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.248
Right, this is what it was.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:32.786
You would've come to my place like this,
if you hadn't heard from me today, right?

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.594
-I thought you were a monster.
-Me? Why?

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.862
Like, a burglar?

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:43.096
NODS

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.432
You walked in wearing a mask.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.500
WEIRD MONSTER

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.901
Wait, but what monster?

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.437
-Did you have a dream?
-I don't remember.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.573
Jung Kook looked exactly like this
15 minutes ago.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.345
I got in the car right after waking up.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.081
-When?
-I was napping at the clinic.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.051
I opened the door,
and bam, there was a camera.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.587
A SUDDEN MESSAGE FROM PRODUCTION CREW
TWO HOURS AGO

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.822
JUNG KOOK AT THE CLINIC

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.090
WILL BE THERE BY 4:30 P.M

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.224
JUNG KOOK'S ALL PACKED

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.093
JIMIN'S OFF THE GRID, ONE SEC

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.194
GASP, HE'S AT HOME

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.429
WE'RE KIDNAPPING JIMIN

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.097
ON OUR WAY TO PARKING LOT

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.667
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, 5:00 P.M.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:26.139
TARGET LOCKED

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.476
ON OUR WAY TO MEET HIM NOW

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.281
What is this?

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.917
PUPILS STARTING TO DART AROUND FASTER

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.620
-What about Jimin?
-[producer] You need to go pick him up.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.456
[chuckles]

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.826
[Jung Kook] I'm seriously
not lying about this.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.261
There was really no heads-up at all today.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.866
I was so surprised.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.268
So this is what a surprise is.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.238
Not a bad start.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.539
DOPAMINE CHARGED

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:03.143
By the way, where are we going?
You can tell me now, right?

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.544
[producer] That's a no-go.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:06.747
So I can't even see the tickets?

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.181
Guess not.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.517
-Is it far?
-[producer] Maybe.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.319
-Is it hot there?
-[producer] Maybe.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.788
-I hope it's cold there.
-[producer] Maybe.

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:15.922
Ah...

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.424
Man, I can't believe this.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.559
Wait, I believe it. No, I don't.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.027
CLUELESS AND LOST

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.764
Welcome, everyone, to Are You Sure?!.

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.701
[producer]
Actually, this was your idea, Jung Kook.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.736
-Do you remember?
-Yes.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.538
-[producer] The surprise visit?
-Yes.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:35.742
Actually, I wasn't expecting it,
but we really did it as I suggested.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.277
It was a fun experience.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:41.014
Honestly, I haven't had
many surprises like this before.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.216
It was really fun.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.986
I didn't think you'd come
while I was sleeping.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.721
Maybe when I was doing some...

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.825
But then, I guess the real issue is
that I slept in way too late.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.529
Yeah, I didn't expect everyone
to just barge into my house.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.398
Right.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.667
-[producer] Okay, so...
-[Jung Kook] Yes.

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:04.337
[producer] We've prepared
a surprise ambush that you all loved.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.539
SATISFIED

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.576
[producer] We'll move to the next spot
and see what we need for a trip.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.345
We'll figure that out
through a fun little game.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.748
WHAT'S CHANGED ON ARE YOU SURE?! SEASON 2

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.818
Like, way more random games
sprinkled throughout.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.653
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D LIKE

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:23.156
SO WE PREPARED A BIT OF EVERYTHING

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.525
BUT THERE'S A CATCH

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:28.228
ALLOWANCE

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.897
SLEEPING TIME AND SO ON

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.099
WILL BE GIVEN ACCORDING TO GAME RESULTS

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.569
HOW THEY APPROACH GAMES

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.371
1. A LITTLE SCHEMING

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.006
-Jung Kook. What...
-[man 1] Wrong!

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:42.676
2. CUTE PERSUASION

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.644
Okay, this is... [laughing]

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.745
Isn't it...?

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:48.582
3. SUDDEN PERFORMANCE ART

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:52.352
4. A BIT OF BICKERING

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.421
-You're seriously petty.
-All of them.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.423
Do you think I'm a fool?

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.391
THEY END UP FACING OFF WITH THE CREW

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.593
[Jung Kook] Why can't I?

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.361
I'm gonna use every dirty trick.

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.196
Call me Yut God, please.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.265
[in English] You got the best of me.

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:07.133
[in Korean] Back-do!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.702
JOY

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.471
DESPAIR

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.206
ENCOURAGEMENT?

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.543
PURE CHAOTIC FUN

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.678
How are you going to catch this?

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.113
LEGENDARY GAMES ARE ON THE WAY

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.481
[Jimin] That was legendary.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.682
STAY TUNED

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.584
What if there's no rental car?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.053
Then we'll use public transport.

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:34.227
[producer] Since we came to Jimin's house,

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.163
-we'll give you 10 minutes to pack.
-[snorts, laughs]

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.466
-This is ridiculous.
-[producer] On top of that,

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.935
-at 6:00 p.m.,
-6:00 p.m. sharp.

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:44.571
we'll be heading out.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.106
[Jimin] Where are we going?

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.341
-Better hurry up.
-Where are we going?

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.543
[producer] You need to pack first.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.847
[Jung Kook] I asked on the way here
where we were going.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:54.981
But they wouldn't say.

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.616
Okay, now.

00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:59.419
[Jimin] My eyes are all puffy.

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.255
I have pillow marks.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.057
[producer] You got pillow marks?

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.661
I'm so curious though.

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.463
[Jimin] My house is a mess right now.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.932
JIMIN'S OFF TO PACK

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:16.636
JUNG KOOK MAKES EYE CONTACT
WITH THE CAMERA

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:20.740
THAT SOUND YOU HEAR IS JIMIN PACKING

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.242
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.111
SINCE HE CAN'T GO HOME,
HE FINISHES PACKING VIA VIDEO CALL

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.546
Yup, that's right.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.315
-[man] Got it.
-Okay.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.356
Just in case.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.859
-Done packing?
-[Jimin] Just threw stuff in.

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:42.696
I gotta wash these, too.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.197
I mean...

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.368
I was really going to clean today.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.772
[Jung Kook] You didn't
see this trip coming?

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.409
I thought we were leaving yesterday.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.479
But then I was like, "Oh, we're not?",
and relaxed.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.816
SUITCASE SEALED

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.784
You packed? Already? Everything?

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.755
-Just enough to survive.
-Just enough to survive?

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.625
I packed 10 pairs of underwear,
10 pairs of socks.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.664
Contacts, toothbrush, face wash,
and skincare.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:22.669
Sheet masks too?

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.871
If you want to, go ahead.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.076
[Jimin] My place is so messy.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.345
Isn't this clean enough?

00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.214
Your standards got stricter.

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:36.516
You're not packing clothes?

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.551
-Clothes...
-Going to buy them there?

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.187
I asked the styling team.

I was on my phone, and bam, you.

PHOTO BY JIMIN

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:50.102
Man, the cameras have killer quality.

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.571
We saw the cake.

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.573
-You did?
-Yes.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:54.774
We're not supposed to?

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.909
No, go ahead. Enjoy it.

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:57.977
How do you close...

00:17:58.044 --> 00:18:00.246
Maybe we weren't supposed
to see that cake.

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:01.380
-Or not?
-Really?

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:06.886
-Didn't they say there'd be a game later?
-Right.

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:10.222
Maybe we were supposed to open it
and celebrate then?

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:14.694
I don't know. I think they forgot about it
and told us there were drinks in there.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.329
Yeah, I think so, too.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.764
A SURPRISE THAT WASN'T A SURPRISE

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.232
Want to try this one?

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.902
I'd really appreciate it
if you could give me one.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.238
Thank you.

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:31.777
SHARING RICE BALLS LIKE GOOD FRIENDS

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.381
FORGETTING THE CUTLET
ROUND TWO BEGINS

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.449
This is so good.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:37.984
[Jung Kook] Mmm!

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.186
-Feels like grilled spicy pork.
-Yeah.

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.088
Very impressive.

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:45.591
This is so good.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.462
Mmm!

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:51.430
It's delicious.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:52.498
So good.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.669
-Wow, cutlet and spicy pork.
-That's love. True love.

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.739
-My trip is over.
-Huh?

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.742
I'm done already.
I just ate all my favorite dishes.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.977
[chuckles]

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.679
I've experienced it all.

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:08.614
Spicy pork is my number one.

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.517
You mean between the two?
Oh, from today's meal?

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.319
-No, in general.
-In general?

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.154
That's hard for me to choose then.

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:18.424
I've got a few
that are always top contenders.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:22.028
Pork cutlet, spicy pork, kimchi stew,
and grilled pork belly.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:25.264
Soju always goes with it, pork belly.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.433
-With soju...
-Too much of a cheat combo?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.901
Totally.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:32.338
-[Jimin] True. You done eating?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:33.906
Please clean the table.

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:35.074
ROLES ASSIGNED

00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:36.676
Is this hand sanitizer?

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.778
It must be dish soap.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.913
It's dish soap.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.451
Like a cooking team.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.486
[Jung Kook laughs]

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.522
You cook, I do the dishes.

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:53.959
-You really like doing the dishes.
-Me?

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.395
You even said
you wanted to do them when we left.

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:57.463
[chuckles]

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.799
I couldn't clean yesterday
due to a hangover.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.634
JIMIN'S DISHWASHING ROUTINE

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.570
1. SCRUB LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:07.206
2. RINSE THOROUGHLY

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:09.642
3. WIPE DOWN THE SINK

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.446
4. HANG UP THE SPONGE NEATLY

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:16.115
5. PERFECT FINISH

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:20.019
THE END OF JIMIN'S DISHWASHING SESSION

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:22.388
[Jung Kook] What now?

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.423
[producer] All right, you two.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.292
You're curious where you're going.

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.127
-Yes.
-We're dying to know.

00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:30.763
[producer] So we've prepared a game.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.467
-Depending on how many you get right,
-Okay.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.702
you'll get chances to ask a question.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:38.003
Huh?

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.406
We're not really good
at asking good questions.

00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:42.274
Better get as many as possible right.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.776
Just questions.

00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:45.544
Yeah, just questions. All right.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.048
GAME BOX ENTERS THE SCENE

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:50.549
[in English] "Jack in the Box".

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:51.884
j-hope.

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:53.853
[producer] First up.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.421
The first game is...

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.693
A flag quiz.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.761
Flags?

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.364
WHAT IS FLAG QUIZ?

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:06.966
One, two, three.

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:11.103
GUESS THE CORRECT COUNTRY
BASED ON THE FLAG SHOWN

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.206
NUMBER OF CORRECT ANSWERS
= NUMBER OF QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.374
GUESS BY QUESTIONS

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.209
-Here we go.
-Okay, bring it on.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.578
-I'm counting on you.
-I'm counting on you.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:21.647
One, two, three.

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:22.815
One, two, three.

00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:24.049
-Jimin
-UK.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.718
-UK.
-Correct.

00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:27.953
We have to raise our hands?

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.422
I mean, we're doing it as a team.

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.892
-Win. I win...
-No, no.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:34.693
Is it right?

00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:36.428
SECOND QUESTION

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.030
-One, two, three.
-I'm confused.

00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:40.032
-I'm not sure.
-Is it printed poorly?

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:44.103
Was the red supposed to be on top?
Darn it, this is confusing.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.471
-No, the blue...
-Now, one.

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:47.406
Isn't it too bright? Or maybe not?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.377
-France? No, right?
-It's kind of...

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:53.445
SHARING NEURONS

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.681
One, two, three. I have no idea!

00:21:56.582 --> 00:21:59.585
ANSWER: LUXEMBOURG

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.354
-Okay, here we go.
-I really know nothing about flags.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.491
One, two, three.

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:07.159
S...

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:09.428
-Switzerland? Sweden? Switzerland?
-Switzerland?

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:10.496
SO CLOSE

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:12.031
Say it clearly. One, two, three.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:13.332
-Switzerland.
-Correct.

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:14.633
-Good.
-Nice.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.835
TWO QUESTIONS EARNED

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:16.936
[producer] Here we go.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.170
FOURTH QUESTION

00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:19.605
Okay, one.

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.273
-Two.
-Argentina.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.341
Correct.

00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:23.576
THREE QUESTIONS EARNED

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:25.644
I'm starting to sweat. I'm nervous.

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.813
-What's your answer?
-What was it?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.849
One, two, three.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.151
-England?
-[producer] Nope.

00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:33.586
-Mexico?
-Correct.

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:34.753
Really?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.056
Are we not allowed to take back?

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:39.058
ONLY ONE SHOT PER FLAG

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:42.361
-Got two right so far. Right.
-Wait, three, including Argentina.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:44.230
-Three including Argentina.
-Yay.

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:46.265
-We can't just blurt things out.
-Next.

00:22:46.332 --> 00:22:47.333
SIXTH QUESTION

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:49.368
-Hey.
-[producer] One, two, three.

00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:50.703
I BELIEVE IN YOU

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:52.438
-Three.
-Norway?

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:53.873
-Nope.
-What is it?

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.274
-Sweden.
-Oh, Sweden.

00:22:55.341 --> 00:22:56.876
That's why I nudged you.

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:59.645
-You could've said it.
-What if it was wrong?

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.213
WANTED HIM TO GET IT RIGHT

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:04.183
STILL AT THREE QUESTIONS

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.251
SEVENTH QUESTION

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.352
-Okay.
-What is this?

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:09.054
One, two... Open your eyes.

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:10.656
I can't really see it.

00:23:11.257 --> 00:23:13.192
[producer] Okay. One, two, three.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.495
-I think I saw this on TikTok.
-You've been to this one.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.665
Don't say that. It makes it even harder.

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:22.768
-We...
-We've been to so many places.

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:27.539
OVER 23 COUNTRIES

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:28.974
-Oh!
-[producer]One.

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:30.476
-Oh!
-Oh!

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.810
I can't remember.

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.213
-Thailand?
-What?

00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:36.548
Tango?

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.450
Thailand? Vietnam?

00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:40.786
It's kind of humid.

00:23:40.853 --> 00:23:43.055
-Yeah, feels like Southeast Asia.
-Humid.

00:23:43.122 --> 00:23:44.390
Mongolia? Thailand?

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.991
-Nope.
-Vietnam?

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:47.259
WINK BARGAINING
RESPONDING?

00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:49.328
-Vietnam.
-[producer] Nope!

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:51.597
-You seriously lied with your eyes.
-Then where?

00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:52.665
Philippines.

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:54.633
You were wrong.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.001
EMBARRASSED

00:23:56.068 --> 00:23:57.102
What did you think?

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.170
That place.

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.506
-Where?
-I can't even remember the name.

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:02.308
-[producer] Still at three.
-I knew it.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.375
Here we go.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.444
Russia. No.

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.849
Okay. One, two, three.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:12.618
-France.
-Correct.

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:15.454
What's wrong with me? You take over now.

00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:17.189
I think I've used up everything.

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:19.425
FOUR QUESTIONS EARNED

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.826
Got to start guessing now.

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:22.027
NINTH QUESTION

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:25.497
All these flags are just different colors.

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:26.632
This is hard.

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:28.867
You've been here before.

00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:31.337
During Bon Voyage Season 1.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.138

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:35.607
-I know.
-Yes?

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:36.675
-Finland.
-Correct.

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:39.278

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.346
10TH QUESTION

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.847
All right. One, two, three!

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.183
Germany does have those colors, too.

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:46.218
-I'm totally lost.
-[producer] No idea?

00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:48.153
-No idea.
-Timor-Leste.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.488
-Pardon?
-Timor-Leste.

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.223
-Where is that?
-Don't even know.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.825
A QUICK LESSON ON TIMOR-LESTE

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.194
TIMOR-LESTE IS LOCATED EAST OF INDONESIA

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.829
1ST NEW SOVEREIGN STATE OF 21C

00:24:56.895 --> 00:25:00.632
-Please remember this stuff.
-Why would we play this game?

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:02.401
Oh!

00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:04.870
Remember Timor-Leste.
I'll look it up later.

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:06.438
-One of them.
-Are we going there?

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.706
[producer] Here we go.

00:25:07.773 --> 00:25:09.174
11TH QUESTION

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:11.076
SYNCHRONIZED EXPRESSIONS

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:12.511
-Should I guess?
-Three.

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:13.979
Is it Antarctica?

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:15.147
WITH CONFIDENCE!

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:17.750
IT IS NEPAL

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.251
-Here we go.
-I have no clue.

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:20.319
12TH QUESTION

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:22.554
-Oh, I know this.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:23.622
-Me.
-[producer] Yes.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.391
Türkiye?

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.859
-Correct.
-Correct, yes.

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:30.295
-Okay, we'll do three more now.
-Okay.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.964
13TH QUESTION

00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:33.632
-Italy.
-Correct.

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:35.701
-Hey, I'm pretty good.
-Impressive.

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:38.237
[producer] One, two, three.

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:40.005
-Oh, this...
-You know this one.

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:41.807
-Right? That one?
-Yeah.

00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.442
Just the first syllable.

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:45.144
-Por...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.545
-Is it Portugal?
-Correct.

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:48.580
Is this the last one?

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:49.748
-Yes, last one.
-Okay.

00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:51.417
FINAL QUESTION

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:53.185
-Brazil.
-Correct.

00:25:53.252 --> 00:25:55.954
You've earned a total of nine chances.

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:57.956
Hold on. We should...

00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:00.759
-We need to think carefully.
-Nine?

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:02.227
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:03.796
-I have a question.
-Yes?

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.297
Is it a new place for us?

00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:07.232
-You've been there.
-What?

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.134
But they don't seem to know.

00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:11.036
Everyone in the back's like, "Huh?"

00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:13.038
Oh, you haven't been there.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:14.573
Ah!

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.675
BEEN TO ABOUT 25 OUT OF 195
ONE OF 171

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:20.012
I'm going to look up Timor-Leste.

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:22.381
A place we've never been to.

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:23.449
Hmm!

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:28.687
"It's a newly independent country
below Indonesia."

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:32.558
-When did it become independent?
-In 2002.

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:36.161
Should I ask what colors are on the flag?

00:26:36.228 --> 00:26:37.696
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:40.232
-Second question.
-[producer] Yes.

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:43.068
Does this country's flag have four colors?

00:26:43.135 --> 00:26:44.803
-You shouldn't ask like that.
-No?

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.939
You already asked it.

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:51.210
-You should've asked what the colors are.
-It does not have four colors.

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.811
-Oh, then that's not it.
-Yeah.

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:54.113
So it's not Timor-Leste.

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.615
Should we ask about the bearing?

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:59.651
TWO ARTILLERY VETERANS HERE

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:02.488
We're artillery guys. We need coordinates.

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:06.492
Ask if it's Northern Europe?

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:09.561
-Nah, it's...
-Feels like it's in Europe.

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.296
If we're right, it's a win.

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.699
But if we're not, we lose big.
That's how it is.

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.601
Should we ask if it's in Europe?

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.269
-If it's in Europe?
-Yeah.

00:27:17.336 --> 00:27:19.371
-Is it in Europe?
-Around Europe?

00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:21.106
Well, yes.

00:27:21.173 --> 00:27:22.174
-Oh.
-Europe.

00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:23.876
-Three.
-[producer] In that area.

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:27.946
-"That area"? So is it in Europe or not?
-We got to ask carefully.

00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:31.850
So I asked if it's in Europe,
but you asked if it was around Europe.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.051
Is it in Europe?

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.953
-Is this your fourth?
-[Jimin] No, no.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.356
I definitely asked, "Is it in Europe?"

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:39.658
-It's that area.
-"That area," you say.

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:43.228
It sounds like it's not Europe.
Is that right?

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:44.296
THAT'S A QUESTION?

00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:46.098
No, that wasn't a question.

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:48.066
Then what is it?

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.869
[producer] All right, you've used
three questions now.

00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:53.138
-Should I ask?
-I'm really curious.

00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:54.673
I can't deduce anything.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.808
I'm curious about the temperature.

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:03.081
Should I tell you today's temperature
or tomorrow's?

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.918
-Or the day after tomorrow?
-All of them.

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:07.986
-You're seriously petty.
-All of them.

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:10.222
What's the average?

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:12.457
-Oh, average temperature?
-The recent one.

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.994
The recent average is roughly
between 15 degrees Celsius

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.197
-Not bad.
-and 26 degrees Celsius.

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:19.264
That's kind of warm.

00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:20.499
So it swings a bit.

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:23.835
Is it one of the flags we saw
during the game?

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:25.504
-Among the flags in the game?
-Yes.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:27.973
-Good question.
-[producer] Sharp one, that.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.041
Yes, it is.

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.142
[both exclaim]

00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:31.810
Is it one of those I got right?

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.581
-Yes, it is.
-That's it. Got it. Almost there.

00:28:36.415 --> 00:28:37.416
I remember them.

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:43.155
UK, South Korea, Brazil,
Argentina, Switzerland.

00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:46.825
Maybe Switzerland?
I think it's Switzerland.

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.494
-I've got a feeling.
-You feel it?

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.798
-Wait, did we get Switzerland right?
-Yeah.

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:56.335
-Or was it Sweden?
-No, we didn't get that one right.

00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:58.370
STAFF STUNNED

00:28:58.437 --> 00:28:59.871
I think it's Switzerland.

00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:01.673
Is it Switzerland?

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:03.642
Is that a question?

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:04.810
Yes.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.511
-You both agree?
-Yes.

00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:08.380
Correct.

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:10.849
You're amazing.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.684
TEAM SPIRIT INTENSIFIES

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.286
-We got it.
-Yes.

00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:17.856
-Switzerland.
-I've heard Switzerland is stunning.

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.324
-We haven't been there?
-No.

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:20.959
-Never been.
-Oh, right.

00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:23.629
I heard it's insane in the winter.

00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:26.265
Like walking into a fairytale.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:28.166
I think we're going to ride this one.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.802
-[producer] What is it?
-Trying to guess here.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.070
-What is it?
-Show us.

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:33.138
No.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.942
IRONCLAD DEFENSE

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:38.210
Let's not show them.

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.746
Let's just show it to the camera.

00:29:41.313 --> 00:29:42.581
Let's go like this.

00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:45.617
-[producer] All right, so now...
-Switzerland.

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:47.619
Yes, you're going to Switzerland.

00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:51.023
-Awesome.
-Great.

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:52.257
Feels like a real trip.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:57.296
MAJESTIC LANDSCAPES YOU'LL NEVER FORGET

00:29:58.063 --> 00:30:02.200
THE SCENERY IS SO BEAUTIFUL
THAT IT FEELS LIKE A FAIRYTALE

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:06.104
ARE YOU SURE?! SEASON 2
IN SWITZERLAND

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:11.076
[producer] So this year's travel trend
is minimalism.

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:12.911
-Right.
-Really?

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:17.616
[producer] Since you all stay on top
of trends, we'll keep things trendy...

00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:20.252
I'm actually far from trendy.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:21.787
And the budget will also be...

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.423
I got my wallet ready.

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:27.426
Wait. I should grab mine, too.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:31.663
[producer]
So you'll be packing as light as possible,

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:35.801
which is why we've prepared these for you.

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:38.704
-The trendy suitcases we prepared,
-We can't pack much?

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.138
please bring them.

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.707
I bet it's a tiny one.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:45.143
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.211
Here.

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:48.847
[Jimin] You're saying
we can't bring anything.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.616
It'll fit just a few pieces of clothing...
God...

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:52.818
This is insane.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:56.421
You know those suitcases
you packed earlier?

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:58.890
-Yes.
-You brought quite a few, huh?

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:00.759
The suitcases...

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.594
Don't show them.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.629
THE SIZE DIFFERENCE

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.198
[producer] Those suitcases are...

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:07.399
FOUR FOR TWO WEEKS

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:08.633
You packed quite a bit.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.805
-So just pack the essentials for now.
-Underwear.

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:17.442
TIME TO PACK LIGHT!

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:23.648
I mean, why did you make us
pack in the first place, then?

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.652
[producer] Well, you needed to
pack your luggage anyway.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.421
Wow, you came prepared.

00:31:29.488 --> 00:31:30.489
A power strip.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.157
My goodness.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.660
Instrument?

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.262
BELONGED TO JUNG KOOK

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:39.998
But you packed it really nicely.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.834
I'm kind of embarrassed to open mine.

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.403
This is pointless.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.172
Even one pair of shoes
takes up this much space.

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.209
Gosh, this is too much.

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.513
I'm kind of having a meltdown.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.781
[Jimin] I think...

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:57.048
I'm going to lose it.

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:01.319
AN UNEXPECTED ORDEAL HAS COME
WITHOUT WARNING

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.754
TRYING TO GATHER HIMSELF

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:05.791
But if I pack this,
there won't be any space for clothes.

00:32:08.527 --> 00:32:10.762
-[producer] Just put them in for now.
-Should we?

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:13.031
PACKING AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:16.268
[Jimin] I don't have much anyway.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.072
-[Jung Kook] Gosh, this is...
-Let's see what they packed for me.

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:23.308
JIMIN'S MINIMALIST PACKING CHALLENGE

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.411
ALL SUITCASES OPENED

00:32:26.478 --> 00:32:28.580
This is just cruel.

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:31.983
I don't think I'll need these.
Let's take these out.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.920
I have this thing.

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:38.457
HE BEGINS PACKING

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:43.829
This is essential.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:45.897
Toothpaste.

00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:51.236
Honestly, I don't have much.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.940
SHEET MASK HE BROUGHT
WITH JUNG KOOK'S PERMISSION

00:32:55.407 --> 00:32:56.408
Done.

00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:58.477
HE'S PACKED HALF OF THE CARRY-ON

00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:03.648
[producer] Since you guys
seem to be struggling...

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:06.084
-Not at all.
-Seems like it.

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.453
-Want to use that one?
-What?

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.388
[Jimin] There's half left over there.

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.390
I mean, I do have some room.

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.393
[producer] Jung Kook seems to be
having a really hard time.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.297
So, we've prepared an extra bag.

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:21.566
Not bad.

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:28.707
-Yeah, not bad.
-Jimin gets a brand-new bag, too.

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:32.077
-[Jimin] Pretty nice.
-It's a new release from the brand.

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:34.679
Oh, it's from that brand

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.715
-Seriously.
-Oh, this one?

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:40.085
[producer] For your trip, this brand
has kindly provided support.

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.386
Thank you.

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:45.156
-[Jimin] As much as I can.
-Why so many holes?

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:46.825
Throw in all the small stuff.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.362
All of it?

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:52.063
Whatever, just toss it all in.

00:33:52.831 --> 00:33:54.599
This bag is actually really nice.

00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:55.867
FILLING THE BAG UP

00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:59.104
-I like the bag.
-[Jimin] It doesn't open like this?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.539
The bag's full.

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.274
I have some space left here too.

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.076
HE PUTS HIS CLOTHES IN THE LEFTOVER SPACE

00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:21.393
[grunts]

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.996
JIMIN COMPLETES HIS MINIMALIST PACKING

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:33.471
MEANWHILE, JUNG KOOK'S STRUGGLE CONTINUES

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.273
[Jimin] But since it's Switzerland...

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.641
I'm losing my mind.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.546
COMPRESSING THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:34:41.613 --> 00:34:43.014
You have to go.

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.282
[producer] He took it out.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:47.752
[Jimin] Darn it.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.954
First, pants.

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:53.058
I think I can survive 10 days
with just two pairs.

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.893
I don't care anymore.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.861
Whatever.

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.630
THE WHATEVER MINDSET

00:34:58.697 --> 00:35:00.799
-[Jimin] Just in case.
-There's space here too.

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:06.104
FILLING EVERY BIT OF SPACE

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.541
I'll pack all my shorts.

00:35:09.608 --> 00:35:11.743
-[producer] All right, in two minutes,
-What?

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.378
please finish packing up.

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:22.721
FILLING THE REST OF THE SPACE
WITH THREE BLACK T-SHIRTS

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:23.788
Whatever.

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:29.728
JUNG KOOK ALSO COMPLETES
HIS MINIMALIST PACKING

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.596
[producer] We've prepared an extra bag.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.132
A SUITCASE FOR THE TWO TO SHARE

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:35.200
[Jung Kook] Thank you.

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.935
-[Jimin] Two pairs of shoes.
-Right.

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.003
[Jimin] And slippers.

00:35:39.371 --> 00:35:41.206
Current temperature.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.075
I'll put in two.

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:48.079
SHARING THE SPACE IN PEACE,
THEY FINISH PACKING FOR REAL

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.581
Aren't you packing this?

00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.516
-What?
-The bag you carry around.

00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:55.120
Aren't we supposed to
carry this from now on?

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.955
Will we carry it after we arrive?

00:35:57.022 --> 00:35:59.424
-No, you need to carry it from here.
-Exactly.

00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:02.427
-[woman] Jung Kook's done.
-Mine's full.

00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:03.962
[crew laughs]

00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:05.897
Am I supposed to pack this too?

00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:06.965
JUNG KOOK'S IS FULL

00:36:07.032 --> 00:36:10.568
If there's space left here,
put some in here. It'll feel so heavy.

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:14.673
-[Jimin] It'll feel heavy.
-No, it's fine. It's so light.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.641
Super light. It's perfect.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.643
What did you pack in there?

00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:22.914
COMPARING HOW MUCH THEY PUT IN THEIR BAGS

00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.984
Mine feels secure.
I can rest my arm on it, too.

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:27.752
-Same here.
-Perfect fit.

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:30.722
MY PRECIOUS BABY BAG

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:31.790
Is that your baby?

00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:35.360
This will be
the most precious bag of my trip.

00:36:35.894 --> 00:36:37.962
I'll treasure it. I promise I will.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.597
LET'S MAKE GREAT MEMORIES

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:43.168
2025 TRAVEL TREND, MINIMALISM, ACHIEVED

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.869
-Oh?
-[producer] Travel kit.

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:47.238
To use during the trip.

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:48.540
Our names are on them.

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.910
So we didn't need to pack toothbrushes.

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.078
Earplugs?

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:55.046
ONLY THE ESSENTIALS INSIDE

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:57.482
-If you look here...
-Even sunscreen's in here.

00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:58.650
There's a booklet.

00:36:58.717 --> 00:36:59.784
[chuckles]

00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:01.886
If you open it up...

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.655
+ SWITZERLAND TRAVEL GUIDEBOOK

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:05.156
[Jung Kook] Ah!

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.394
There's even a map.

00:37:10.495 --> 00:37:12.764
German, French, Italian, Romansh.

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:16.534
It's a blend of cultures.
But there's nothing we can speak.

00:37:19.838 --> 00:37:21.773
The food here looks amazing, too.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.777
-Lamb. We love lamb, don't we?
-Yeah, we do.

00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:26.945
It's beautiful.

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:28.279
Yeah, this looks fun.

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:31.583
Half boat, half bathtub? What is that?

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.650
What?

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:35.153
There's a place
that's part boat, part bathtub?

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.621
That's awesome.

00:37:37.522 --> 00:37:40.158
There's a bathtub floating in the lake.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:44.295
Can't we bring this on the plane?

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.564
[producer] Yes, you can carry it onboard.

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:48.600
But there's no space in here for this.

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.003
-Want me to put it in mine?
-Wait, this...

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.338
Oh, perfect fit.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.141
It fits just right. The booklet.

00:37:58.143 --> 00:38:01.813
[Jung Kook] Is it too much? Should I take
some out? Is this really minimalism?

00:38:02.547 --> 00:38:04.449
Hey, we're supposed to be minimalists.

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:06.184
It's minimalism, but...

00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:09.287
-That is "many-malism."
-"Many-malism."

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:14.692
-What's "many-malism"?
-It means "too many."

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.262
PACKING IS OFFICIALLY DONE

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.397
BUT IT'S TOO SOON TO FALL ASLEEP

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:20.965
[Jimin] Let me tell you a story.

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.768
There's a training called KCTC
in the army.

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:25.336
It's the biggest drill.

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:27.739
You can't even wash up for two weeks.

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.440
-No sleep.
-No bathrooms.

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:32.544
-No toilets.
-Just stuck in some mountains.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:33.978
In the middle of a field.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.782
You get rained on,
and there's nothing around.

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:39.651
We didn't get to wash for five days.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.386
I was...

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:43.121
"YOUR BODY FEELS SO DIRTY"

00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:46.825
in that kind of state.
Then I was washing up with the others.

00:38:47.592 --> 00:38:49.127
While I was washing,

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:53.398
I felt this sting,
like a jolt or something.

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:54.766
So I looked up like this.

00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.569
Jung Kook was eating military rations

00:38:58.736 --> 00:38:59.737
and looking over.

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:01.472
MEETING JUNG KOOK'S EYES

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.107
I was washing like...

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.943
THE HIGHLIGHT IS JIMIN'S ACTION

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.879
Seriously, he was like...

00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:09.948
SO PASSIONATELY

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:13.818
I was scrubbing like this.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.555
I looked over,
and everyone else was invisible.

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:20.291
The background faded,
just the two of us remained.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:23.728
EYE CONTACT

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:25.697
I was watching for a while, you know?

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.632
I was watching, and the others too...

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.601
-They were like...
-No, no.

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.269
He was scrubbing the hardest.

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:34.272
JIMIN WAS STANDING OUT THE MOST

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.976
The others were all shy and hesitant.

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:42.981
They were just glancing around like this.
But you were right in the middle.

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:46.651
RIGHT IN THE CENTER

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:51.389
SCRUBBING OFF FIVE DAYS
MORE PASSIONATELY THAN ANYONE

00:39:51.456 --> 00:39:54.259
I felt kind of bad.
It was pitiful, really.

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.727
Didn't expect to see that.

00:39:57.595 --> 00:40:00.598
[Jimin] I looked over,
and everyone else was invisible.

00:40:00.665 --> 00:40:03.234
The background faded,
just the two of us remained.

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:06.905
-[producer] Time and space paused a sec.
-[Jimin] Yeah, exactly.

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.707
Should we learn popping again?

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:12.243
I told you yesterday or the day before

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.811
-that I wanted to.
-When?

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.413
Please listen to me.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.981
Yesterday? The day before?

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:20.251
No. The day I was discharged.
I told you that day.

00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:23.655
I want to start from the basics
and fix my lines again.

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.659
Since you've learned it,
I'll follow your lead.

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:29.761
We need to close the gap with j-hope.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:33.231
j-hope literally won competitions though.

00:40:33.298 --> 00:40:35.900
Can we even close that gap?

00:40:36.334 --> 00:40:38.436
Should we call j-hope?
You think he's asleep?

00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:41.406
So I'm planning

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:45.944
to take lessons even while I'm
in the States. When I'm not recording.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.045
SPECIAL GUEST: J-HOPE

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.213
-Hey.
-[j-hope] Yeah.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.515
Just checking in.

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:52.183
What the...

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.485
-j-hope.
-Hey, hey.

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:56.254
Good job on the show.

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.556
-Is that Jung Kook?
-Yes.

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.692
-Are you filming that show?
-Yes.

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:03.127
-Are You Sure?! Right?
-Yeah.

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:04.629
We were talking about you.

00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:05.830
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:07.065
That you're sick.

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.767
Nah, you guys are the sick ones.

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.336
He says that every time.

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:13.604
-Hey.
-Yeah.

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:17.442
You always say that, so I actually
believed it, but it turns out it's not.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.747
I lived in that delusion for a while,
back in the day.

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:26.084
-What delusion?
-Totally wrong.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.185
What are you doing?

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.721
We're eating sashimi.

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:32.623
-Where?
-Near Incheon International Airport.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.225
-[j-hope] Airport?
-Yeah.

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:38.730
-Are you going somewhere? Tomorrow?
-We're leaving tomorrow morning.

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:41.799
-Really? Where to this time?
-We're headed to Switzerland.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:44.869
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Don't go telling people.

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:45.937
What?

00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:48.606
Don't tell anyone where we're going.

00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:52.210
-Can I post it on Instagram?
-No way.

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.512
"Jung Kook and Jimin
are off to Switzerland."

00:41:54.579 --> 00:41:56.981
DETERMINED TO MESS AROUND
EVERY CHANCE HE GETS

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:58.750
j-hope, I'm going to learn popping.

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:02.754
Out of nowhere? You commit to something
for what, like a week?

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.090
J-HOPE KNOWS JUNG KOOK
LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND

00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:09.994
He's trying to convince me
to learn it for like two days.

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:11.062
Wants me to join.

00:42:11.796 --> 00:42:14.298
Know how that ends?
He quits, and I keep learning.

00:42:16.334 --> 00:42:20.338
By the way, you guys seem super upbeat.
Is it because you're out of the army?

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:21.806
-Probably.
-Yup.

00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:23.274
Life's way better now, right?

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:25.109
-For sure.
-Hey.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:26.210
Right. Yes?

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.979
I'm happy.

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:29.514
-You happy?
-Yeah.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.983
-Enjoy it.
-I don't see any unhappiness right now.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.453
[j-hope laughing]

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.523
Don't get too comfortable, Jimin. Okay?

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:41.159
-Got it.
-[j-hope] Have fun.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.860
Okay.

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:43.928
Later.

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:45.897
-Bye now.
-[j-hope] Yeah.

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.298
END OF A FUN CALL WITH J-HOPE

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.336
THE NEXT MORNING

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.139
[Jimin] I'm hungry. I'm starving.

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:59.777
-Let's go.
-Hold up.

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:01.479
I'm seriously hungry right now.

00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:03.481
I feel hungry too, but I'm so thirsty.

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:08.352
ALL FACIAL MUSCLES ACTIVATED

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.420
Mmm!

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.890
Whoa!

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.158
This is actually good.

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.194
"Oat Ofmom."

00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:18.296
Not bad at all.

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.765
FULLY FOCUSED

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.835
TRYING TO WAKE UP WITH A BANANA OAT DRINK

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:24.902
Tasty.

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.504
[exclaims]

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.973
-Having another one?
-Yes.

00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:32.243
[slurping]

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.311
Done.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.113
Okay. Yeah, this is good.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.550
You've already finished three.
Don't drink that one.

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.486
[Jung Kook] It's so good.

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:43.855
They say it can replace a meal.

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:44.922
A meal...

00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:47.658
I'm still hungry.

00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:53.531
-You should try this.
-Let's go catch a flight.

00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:55.199
-It's good.
-Let's go.

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:57.335
HE CAN'T SEEM TO LEAVE

00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.104
STOMACH'S OPEN FOR BUSINESS
BRIGHT AND EARLY

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:03.741
He's still eating on the way.

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:04.809
Let's go.

00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:05.943
FUELING UP

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.078
Good morning.

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.249
As you can see,

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:15.319
the weather's like...

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.921
A FOGGY MORNING

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:18.122
It's foggy.

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:22.527
And there's dew everywhere.

00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:26.330
I love this kind of weather.

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:28.499
I really enjoy traveling.

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:30.401
You know what I mean?

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:35.072
These leaves... They're all dewy, right?

00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:38.809
Look. Totally soaked in dew.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:42.680
Just like me.

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:45.583
DEWY WEATHER, CHECKED

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.717
So dewy.

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.487
We're headed to the airport now.

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:51.422
Jimin.

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.525
Make it a good one.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.897
Do people usually say that
and shake hands on a trip?

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.632
No, right?

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:02.700
Why not?

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.769
Well, because it's just a trip.

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:05.836
No, it's business.

00:45:07.205 --> 00:45:08.272
Stay sharp.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.642
I'm fully alert now.

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.978
-It's business.
-Wow, this is business.

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:16.347
-We're doing this for a reason.
-[in English] Okay.

00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:18.950
-[in Korean] I'll do my best on this trip.
-Good.

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:24.622
DRIVING THROUGH THE RAIN

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:28.092
INCHEON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:32.063
EXCITEMENT TAKING OFF, TOO

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:35.933
AROUND 10 HOURS INTO THE FLIGHT

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.703
[groans]

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.872
VIBRATION MODE ON

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:44.342
Jung Kook's still asleep?

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.077
He's still asleep?

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.845
He hasn't woken up once.

00:45:52.183 --> 00:45:56.887
DEEP SLEEP KING

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:59.490
He only had trouble sleeping in the army.

00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:01.892
HE ESCAPED INSOMNIA
THE MOMENT HE GOT DISCHARGED

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:10.268
FINALLY AWAKE

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.836
-You up?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.537
You didn't wake up once.

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.573
-No, I did.
-You did?

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.209
I did but went right back to sleep.

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:22.813
Waking up 10 minutes
before landing is the best.

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:25.583
It keeps following me.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.351
JIMIN'S STICKER-CAM

00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:28.619
High-tech stuff.

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.856
Oh, it's only following me.

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:38.896
GLOWING SKIN STARTS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:41.565
LATHER IT ON

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.407
Smells like perfume.

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:51.042
Yeah, perfume.

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:52.109
Smells nice.

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:55.212
-I think it smells so good.
-Yeah.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.381
Kind of like...

00:46:57.448 --> 00:46:59.350
"I WANT TO KEEP SMELLING IT"

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:00.418
forest scent?

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.088
This scent is great.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.491
And it's not slippery.

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.593
That's why I like it.

00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:12.430
I like it.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:18.569
SMELLS AMAZING

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:19.904
Oh, Jung Kook.

00:47:21.272 --> 00:47:22.373
Brace yourself.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.741
WINK

00:47:23.808 --> 00:47:28.746
LANDING MUSIC ON

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:30.381
We're here.

00:47:30.448 --> 00:47:31.449
We've arrived.

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:35.619
[in English] Bye-bye.

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:37.755
Sorry, sorry.

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:40.825
Wow, Switzerland.

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:46.197
[in Korean] They say it's really beautiful
once you step outside.

00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:49.900
RM used to brag

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.437
about it a lot.

00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:55.806
He recommended
that I should visit this place.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.342
He told me so much about it.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.979
NATURE PAINTED IN EMERALD TONES

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:04.181
EVEN JUST LOOKING AT IT

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:05.983
HEALS EVERYTHING

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.818
A PLACE THAT

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:09.854
DEFINES THE WORD "BEAUTY"

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.456
ARE YOU SURE?! SEASON 2 IN SWITZERLAND
STARTS NOW

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:13.891
Shall we go?

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.993
First trip after discharge.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.828
-Right.
-Switzerland.

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.864
Switzerland.

00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:21.999
Let's go!

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.170
-[Jung Kook] It's different.
-[Jimin] Perfect weather.

00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:29.340
EVEN THE WEATHER IS PERFECT
FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.541
This feels surreal.

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.010
It really feels surreal.

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:35.446
What feels surreal?

00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:36.981
Me driving.

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.417
Me driving in a foreign country.

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:43.721
-We were in the army just a few days ago.
-Exactly.

00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:46.290
-Not even a week ago.
-No.

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:47.925
For real.

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:51.262
SOFT AND SENTIMENTAL

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:52.329
Why?

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.231
It was a long journey.

00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:59.937
DRIVING DOWN A ROAD AS LONG AS THE WAIT

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:03.140
SOAKING IN THE FREEDOM NATURE GIVES

00:49:03.207 --> 00:49:04.708
Wow.

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.277
CAN'T HELP BUT GASP IN AWE

00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:08.879
This is so beautiful.

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.617
It just feels so peaceful here.

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:18.456
A CALMING PLACE
WHERE EVEN TIME SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN

00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:24.962
A RELAXED AND PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE
WHERE EVEN URGENCY TAKES A BREAK

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:27.631
I once looked up a lot about Switzerland.

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.500
-Yeah? In the past?
-Yeah.

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:33.370
They say there's hardly any jealousy here.

00:49:34.405 --> 00:49:37.842
-Even the driving feels like that.
-Like what?

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:41.512
How should I put it?
It's not aggressive at all.

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:44.415
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Everyone drives so calmly.

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:45.649
Yeah, I feel that, too.

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:47.918
You know what?

00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:50.788
After I joined the army,

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:53.257
when I drove during leave,

00:49:54.425 --> 00:49:56.794
everything felt so joyful.

00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:59.029
-I let everyone cut in.
-[chuckles softly]

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.998
MOTHER TERESA ON WHEELS

00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:02.299
-That makes sense.
-Okay.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.568
Like, "Go ahead, please."

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:08.138
And if they used their blinker?
Even better.

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.206
Oh yes.

00:50:10.341 --> 00:50:12.743
Driving to the office alone,

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.945
I'd be like, "They're so nice."

00:50:16.347 --> 00:50:19.517
You need peace of mind, you know?

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.654
THE SCENERY FLOWS AS GENTLY AS YOUR HEART

00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:26.223
I heard Switzerland's pretty pricey.

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:30.828
Was it like 1-something for 1,600 won?

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:31.896
-Franc.
-One franc?

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:35.032
-Yeah, about 1,650 won per franc.
-Exactly.

00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:38.402
Franc just sounds so cute.

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:40.170
But things sure are expensive here.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:44.308
French toast is 33,000 won.
That's a bit steep, isn't it?

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:47.244
Not exactly a light price.

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.883
It's Jin's song.

00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:02.259
HUMMING CUTELY

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:04.428
Jin's voice is kind of light too, right?

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:08.732
Probably, yeah?

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.669
Three of us have soft voices.

00:51:12.136 --> 00:51:13.370
-Us three?
-Except V.

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:20.077
EARS IN HEAVEN ON THIS DRIVE

00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.012
Three Audis.

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:23.814
Definitely rented.

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:26.584
Four Audis? Yeah, rentals.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.319
One more, and I'll fully buy it.

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:29.853
-Nope, that's it.
-That's all.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.089
DETECTIVE MODE OFF

00:51:33.357 --> 00:51:35.059
But why are they rentals?

00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:39.563
If they bought them together,
that's kind of cute.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.131
Let's do that.

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:44.568
ROAD TRIP IN OUR MATCHING CARS

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:49.974
Next time we do Are You Sure?! in Korea,
let's use our own cars.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.409
-How's that sound?
-Oh, ours? I like it.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.845
Sounds fun. I think it would be great.

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:56.647
Yeah.

00:51:56.714 --> 00:51:58.916
We'll be in our own cars, on the phone.

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:00.250
But where would we go?

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:01.852
Your place?

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.788
Going around Seoul to your place?

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:07.725
Then going around again to my place.

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.194
And we film for 10 days.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.528
TOURING SEOUL FOR 10 DAYS

00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:13.664
The members' places.

00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:16.400
TOURING BTS MEMBERS' HOMES FOR 10 DAYS

00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:22.272
[Jung Kook] We're here.

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.041
[Jimin] I think it's that grey one.

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:26.777
[in English] Check-in.

00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:29.647
Please head inside.

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:33.083
The chill in the air feels nice.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.120
-If it were hot, it would've been rough.
-[in Korean] Yeah.

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:39.490
-Hot in the day, chilly at night.
-There's a trampoline.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.693
-[Jung Kook] That's a trampoline, right?
-I think so.

00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:45.162
Want to see?

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.164
You want to see my flip?

00:52:47.231 --> 00:52:48.899
-Here?
-[Jung Kook] Is it here?

00:52:48.966 --> 00:52:50.100
[Jimin] Oh, over there?

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.703
Here? Where? Right here?

00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:55.973
-Here?
-Is it here?

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.876
-Yeah, here.
-Did you gain weight? Is it obesity?

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:01.011
Can't take this lightly.

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:04.581
-The results are in.
-It's just weight gain.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:05.949
-[Jimin] Wow.
-Wow, the vibe.

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.952
-[Jimin] The vibe inside feels classy.
-Oh, wow.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.020
LINED WITH BOTTLES

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:11.455
-Wine.
-I want to drink some...

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:12.990
-No, better not.
-Where?

00:53:13.057 --> 00:53:16.126
IT'S BASICALLY A WINE CELLAR

00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:18.562
-Did you see the meat?
-No, I missed it.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:22.299
Look, they're resting the meat.

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:23.400
MEAT RESTING

00:53:23.467 --> 00:53:25.569
[Jimin] That's no joke.

00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:28.472
[Jung Kook] That's really hard, you know?
Grilling it right.

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:31.408
SEATED IN A FLASH

00:53:31.475 --> 00:53:32.876
Ready? Are you ready to eat?

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.111
Yes, I'm ready.

00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:36.714
-[server in English] Hi, guys.
-[both in English] Hi.

00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:38.882
Thank you.

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:41.351
-[in Korean] We each get one menu.
-[in Korean] What?

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:45.522
THE CHALLENGE BEGINS
THE MOMENT THE MENU ARRIVES

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:48.459
LOST FINGERS IN A SEA OF GERMAN

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:52.529
UNINTENTIONAL DEEP DIVE INTO THE MENU

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:54.965
SCRATCHES HEAD

00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:56.734
At times like this,

00:53:57.267 --> 00:54:00.938
just take a picture and let it translate.

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.206
Like this.

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:03.841
CALLING IN THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:07.377
-This looks like the main dish section.
-I think it's here.

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:11.148
This seems like lamb.
And this one looks like beef.

00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:13.317
But I can't tell what's what.

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.519
Let's just go with these.

00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:17.154
FOUR-CHEESE PLATTER
CURED MEAT

00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:18.622
LAMB STEAK
FILLET STEAK

00:54:18.689 --> 00:54:19.923
-Ready?
-[in English] Hello.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.325
-[in English] Yeah.
-Ready.

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.392
Yes? Okay.

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.460
[in Korean] First...

00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:24.862
-The lamb?
-Yeah.

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:26.130
-One.
-[in English] Lamb...

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.799
-Large size. Yeah. One.
-Big, yes?

00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:30.200
And for sides?

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.002
-Sides?
-You can choose the...

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:33.837
bramata, it's like a corn.

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.507
Uh, roast potatoes or mashed potatoes?

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:37.975
-[Jimin] Ah!
-Hmm!

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.511
-Mashed potato. Yeah.
-Mashed potato? Yeah?

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:42.112
-[in Korean] Good, right?
-Yeah.

00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:43.347
[in English] And...

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:45.482
-Fillet, large size.
-Yes.

00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:47.417
What kind of side dish?

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.786
Oh. Side dish?

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:51.455
SECOND WAVE OF SIDE DISH ATTACK

00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:53.757
-Mashed?
-[in Korean] No, we should...

00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:55.659
-Medium rare. Yeah.
-Medium rare?

00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:58.595
-[Jimin in Korean] But we're clueless.
-Go with the flow.

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.798
Should we go with red or white wine?

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:03.066
-I'm leaning toward red, for sure.
-Totally red?

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.936
-Oh, that looks classy, right?
-I like it.

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:08.305
[Jung Kook] Let's pick reddest red
among the reds?

00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:10.174
-[Jimin] Super red.
-[chuckles]

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.577
-Deep, deep red.
-Just snap a pic and ask for it.

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:15.846
-[camera clicks]
-Take the photo of it and...

00:55:15.913 --> 00:55:18.549
Just show this
and say, "One bottle, please." Right?

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.150
-Let's do that.
-Let's go.

00:55:20.217 --> 00:55:21.218
-Hey.
-Yeah?

00:55:21.952 --> 00:55:22.953
Let's go.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.657
[Jung Kook chuckles]
It says "GAJA."

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:27.724
[Jimin] Let's go.

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:29.726
LOOKING UP THE WINE

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:32.329
-I think it's a famous one. Good pick.
-Really?

00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:34.464
-You felt it, right?
-Apparently,

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:37.067
wine lovers are obsessed with it.

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:41.004
-We have a good eye.
-I think we picked a good wine.

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:43.173
-Cheers.
-Let's look sad.

00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:47.277
CHEERS WITH SLIGHTLY TEARY EYES

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:50.881
FIRST WINE IN SWITZERLAND

00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:51.949
This is nice.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.450
-It's good?
-[in English] Yeah.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.320
[in Korean] So good, really.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.355
EYES WIDE OPEN

00:55:58.422 --> 00:55:59.489
[in English] Thank you.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.258
Good... [in English] Thank you.

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:02.326
RIGHT UP THEIR ALLEY

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:06.530
[in Korean] I looked it up.
Sunset starts at 8:50 p.m.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:10.434
-And sunrise is at 5:50 a.m.
-[Jung Kook in Korean] It's fascinating.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.635
EVEN IN THE EVENING...

00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:13.804
IT'S STILL BRIGHT OUTSIDE

00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:17.875
We usually love the dark and nighttime.

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.111
And we came to a place
where night comes so late.

00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:22.846
I just saw Bam recently.

00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.818
JOKE BLOCKED

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:30.687
FINALLY, THE MAIN DISH ARRIVES

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:34.157
-The Angus fillet.
-Wow.

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.859
-[Jimin] What's this?
-That's beef.

00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:37.661
FILLET STEAK

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.997
-Wow, this is...
-Why is it so tender?

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.431
NEXT-LEVEL TENDERNESS

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:43.600
[Jimin] I've never had steak
like this before.

00:56:45.035 --> 00:56:46.103
Looks like rare.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.073
SAVORING IT SERIOUSLY

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.942
I'm glad I ordered this. It's good.

00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:53.243
Is it? Let me try it.

00:56:57.681 --> 00:56:59.149
-Mmm!
-[in English] Delicious.

00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:00.384
[in Korean] It's so good.

00:57:01.285 --> 00:57:02.486
So good.

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.288
My appetite's awake now.

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:06.423
[in English] Come on.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:07.591
[in Korean] Thank you.

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:11.495
RECEIVING THE LAMB WITH REVERENCE

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.030
LAMB STEAK

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.765
This one looks super tender, too.

00:57:15.399 --> 00:57:18.669
COME TO MY MOUTH

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:19.970
Mmm!

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.105
[Jung Kook] How's the taste?

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.307
GOOD FOOD IS FOR SHARING

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.344
Ah!

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:28.845
-It's good.
-Yeah.

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:32.049
SNEAKY GLANCE

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:34.151
HIS HAND WANTS SOMETHING

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:37.120
-I want to grab it.
-Me too.

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.156
JUST GO FOR IT

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:41.224
AND GNAW IT OFF

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.826
-This feels right.
-Yeah.

00:57:42.893 --> 00:57:43.994
HOLDING AND TEARING

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:51.768
PICKING UP THE EATING PACE

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.804
MEANWHILE, NEXT TO HIM...

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.939
ONE GUY IS FULLY DEVOTED TO MEAT

00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.277
HIS FACE SAYS IT ALL

00:58:00.344 --> 00:58:02.980
AND SO DOES HIS BODY

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.615
-What?
-It's better with salt and pepper.

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.117
The beef, too.

00:58:07.184 --> 00:58:08.452
This is amazing.

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.620
STILL ON THE PERFECT COMBO QUEST

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:15.459
FAVE COMBO = LAMB AND BASIL

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:17.928
JUST LIKE HIM, HE ADDS BASIL TOO

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:21.565
Mmm! Mmm!

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:23.333
SO GOOD

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.735
I'm about to explode.

00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:26.570
Jung Kook, cheers.

00:58:27.738 --> 00:58:30.607
WRAPPING IT UP WITH WINE

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.676
[Jimin] That was a great meal.

00:58:32.743 --> 00:58:34.411
That was good.

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:35.579
[Jung Kook] I liked it.

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:39.316
There's no plastic bag in the car,
so we'll have to carry it.

00:58:39.383 --> 00:58:40.751
[Jimin grunts]

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:42.319
Also the suitcases.

00:58:42.386 --> 00:58:44.021
Right. Yeah.

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:48.525
MINIMALIST: ONE PERSON, ONE SUITCASE

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.695
-This...
-How do we carry this?

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:54.331
Rock, paper, scissors?
[laughs]

00:58:54.398 --> 00:58:55.766
How do we carry all this?

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.100
We bought too much water.

00:58:57.167 --> 00:58:59.936
[Jung Kook] Let's not take all.
We won't use them at once.

00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:02.239
Get some bottled water.

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.742
BUYING DRINKING WATER FOR THE STAY

00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:06.910
Will six be enough?

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.813
[Jimin] Should we get smaller ones, too?

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.881
Water...

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:13.016
Want to live on water?

00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.551
BIG SPENDER JUNG KOOK

00:59:14.618 --> 00:59:17.020
-[Jung Kook] Can drink it outside too.
-Die hydrated.

00:59:17.087 --> 00:59:19.923
PLASTIC BAGS? THAT'S A LUXURY

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.225
-[Jimin] Die hydrated?
-Let's just drown in water.

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:24.461
[Jung Kook] Got to stay hydrated.

00:59:24.528 --> 00:59:26.129
BOTTLES TOSSED IN THE BACK

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.932
THEY BROUGHT IT UPON THEMSELVES

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:33.236
IT'S TIME TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.871
-That's a good idea.
-Right?

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:35.939
SORTING MISSION

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:37.140
[Jung Kook] It's cold.

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.410
-It's cold.
-You're not drinking beer, right?

00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:43.647
Me? Just in case, let's take it.

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:44.781
[Jimin] Just in case?

00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:47.284
You got to be prepared.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.719
Huh! Grab one more big one.

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.791
[Jung Kook] Feels kind of nice.

00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:56.593
Yeah.

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:57.727
I'M HAPPY TOO

00:59:57.794 --> 01:00:01.198
Feels weird walking in with shoes on.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:04.067
Yeah. Should we take them off? Or not?

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.203
-No, no need to take them off.
-Wait.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:08.538
Let's put this in the fridge first.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:12.642
QUICK UNPACKING SESSION

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:15.812
-Jung Kook, shall we take a look around?
-Rooms?

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.415
There's a washbasin, a shower...

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.083
Even pajamas.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.018
Oh, they prepared these for us.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.253
Let me try lying down.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.222
[Jung Kook] Time to wash up.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.290
-Yes, we should.
-Yes.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.759
[Jung Kook] Should we meet up after?

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.330
I'm stuffed. Like, really full.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.066
WARMING UP WITH A QUICK GAME

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.702
[producer] An allowance is on the line
in this game.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:42.572
-Each one has 50 francs in it.
-That's a lot.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:46.143
50 francs is roughly 90,000 won
in today's exchange rate.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.478
What time is it now?

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:49.546
Right now?

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.414
I think it's 00:13.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.450
[producer] If you guess the time right...

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.051
Down to the minute?

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:57.354
[producer] Give or take five minutes.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.256
I think it's already past midnight.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.624
It should be.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.627
You finished washing around 11:20 p.m.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.428
And I shower pretty quickly.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.665
Add five minutes for delay,
plus another five just in case.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:11.101
I'm guessing around 11:52.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.537
Let's go with plus or minus three minutes.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:16.173
-Oh, I think I'm close.
-You are?

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.707
SENSES ON HIGH ALERT

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.010
The way you're playing dirty like this...

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.512
Still, 11:52 feels right, I think.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.047
-52?
-Yeah.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:26.016
-51? 52.
-52?

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.517
I'll go with 52.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:28.818
[producer] One, two, three.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.820
-It's 11:52.
-11:52.

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.858
-It's 11:50.
-See? I told you to trust me.

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:36.693
-You're amazing.
-Thank you for this.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.994
[Jung Kook] Wow, thank you.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:40.096
I'm pretty punctual, you know.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.464
-Clearly.
-Of course.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.868
Wait, so if I got it wrong,
I wouldn't have gotten any allowance?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.572
-[producer] No allowance.
-I looked up the prices.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:51.808
It's about 33,000 won per meal.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.377
On average, meals cost around 30,000 won.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.347
-Right.
-If you include groceries, that's tight.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.416
-First game, success.
-Yeah.

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.451
-Great start, Jimin. I knew it.
-Yeah.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:05.188
You can count on me.
I've been at this for 12, 13 years.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.524
Why is all your stuff green?

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:09.993
-It really is all green.
-[producer] Even slippers.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.929
We didn't mean to,
it just turned out that way.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:16.566
Looking at my hair, they're trying
to make me look like a little kid.

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:18.235
Well, that's fine.

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.238
I'm fully aware of how I look right now.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.207
[producer] All right, the first game is...

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.910
GUESS THE SONG FROM THE MV

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:28.878
FIVE QUESTIONS PER ROUND

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:31.448
-Jin, "Tuna." No?
-Wrong!

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:34.084
WAKE-UP CALL'S 7:00 A.M.
GET ALL RIGHT, EARN 30 MINUTES

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.952
Wait, not 30 minutes per question?

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:37.153
TRYING TO FINESSE

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.556
-Each is worth 30 minutes?
-That's what I thought.

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.591
[producer] Let's do
five minutes per image.

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:42.859
THAT SOUNDS FAIR

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:43.960
WAIT, THAT'S NOT...

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.463
That doesn't add up to 30 minutes.

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.465
Do you think I'm a fool?

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:52.002
All right then, seven minutes per image.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.670
Man, that's stingy.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.705
-Still, it's five minutes.
-Eight minutes?

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.474
SNEAKY NEGOTIATIONS

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.875
-Go with seven.
-Let's do six.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.076
-Six?
-Yeah, six.

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.478
That's even less.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.281
You should've agreed when it was seven.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.850
You were supposed to get
all five right, originally.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:07.984
For 30 minutes.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:10.220
But now, if you get two right,
it's still 12.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.355
-Right. So it's better for us.
-Yes.

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.257
Let's go with six.

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:15.692
CONVINCED

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.360
Here we go.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:18.628
Let's see.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:20.063
[producer] One, two, three.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.698
-Jung Kook. What...
-[man 1] Wrong!

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:23.066
[producer] One, two, three.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.768
-Jung Kook. What...
-[man 1] Wrong!

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:27.137
JUNG KOOK IS FLUSTERED

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:29.806
[producer] I told you to say
the answer right away.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:31.107
DIPPED HIS TOE INTO VARIETY

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:34.110
-Say something.
-This is just too...

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:37.047
He didn't even finish his name.

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.581
That's kind of, you know...

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.216
That's harsh.

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:44.187
-Give us one more chance.
-Okay, I got the feel.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:45.255
-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:46.323
[producer] Here we go.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:47.424
MV QUIZ BEGINS

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.859
-One, two, three.
-BTS.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.027
-"Fire."
-"Fire."

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:52.629
-Nice.
-[producer] Correct.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:54.597
I'll say the artist, you say the song.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.999
If you don't say a thing...

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:59.235
-[producer] You earned six minutes.
-I'll give you some time to think.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:01.504
-One, two...
-BTS, "Blood Sweat &amp; Tears."

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.239
-Correct.
-How'd you know?

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.307
I don't know.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.777
They're all BTS songs.
Could be solo songs, too.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.212
-Exactly.
-[producer] Next one.

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:10.780
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.615
j-hope... j-hope, "MONA LISA."

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.150
Correct.

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:17.253
I must really love the members.
How do I know?

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:18.855
[producer] Let's go.

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:20.957
-Jin, "Tuna."
-Wrong!

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.892
-Jin, "Tuna."
-Wrong!

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.561
-It's not?
-"Super Tuna."

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:29.466
Jin always says, "Tuna!"

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.601
So it's "Super Tuna."

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:33.436
CURRENT WAKE-UP TIME: 7:18 A.M.

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:34.704
[producer] Let's go.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.772
ROUND TWO BEGINS

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.141
One, two, three.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.310
-BTS, "N.O."
-Correct.

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.712
BTS.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.848
Namjoon.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.184
-One, two...
-Jung Kook, "Euphoria."

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:49.886
[producer] Correct.

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:52.122
Nice one. I didn't know what it was.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:53.890
-Okay.
-How dare you.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:54.991
I'm sorry.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.961
[producer] One, two, three.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.129
-Wrong!
-Jimin...

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.730
One, two, three.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:01.831
-Wrong!
-Jimin...

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:05.101
That's your song. Isn't it "Set Me Free"?

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:06.770
Hey, you should've said it.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:07.837
You were like...

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.305
HIS BODY MOVED FIRST

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.607
I'll stay still.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:12.675
[producer] Here we go.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.678
-One, two...
-BTS, "No More Dream."

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:16.980
-Correct.
-Nice one.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.047
Here we go.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.583
-One... Correct.
-BTS, "DNA."

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.952
-One... Correct.
-BTS, "DNA."

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.320
Okay, plus 24 minutes.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:28.925
[producer] So you've earned
a total of 42 minutes.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:31.795
The staff in the back
are starting to smile now.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:35.498
For the sake of all of you,
Jung Kook will try hard.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.168
What? "Jung Kook will try hard"?

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:40.036
And you will not?

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:43.339
[producer] This time, it's a person quiz.

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.275
-It's different.
-I'm really bad at this.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:46.876
So am I. This is bad.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.412
I once committed
a huge quiz crime, remember?

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:54.284
[producer] So this one...
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.385
Then it's a success.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.420
-You go first.
-[producer] Who first, Jimin?

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.656
-Okay, I'll go.
-All right, here we go.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.125
One, two, three.

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:03.193
-Kim...
-Wrong!

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.260
One, two, three.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:05.328
-Kim...
-Wrong!

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.897
-Kim Yuna.
-I only said "Kim," and he said "Wrong."

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.933
That's kind of unfair.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.869
I'm not sorry about this at all.

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:15.138
If you say "Wrong" when I start to say...

01:06:15.205 --> 01:06:17.140
-That's the speed.
-Got it.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:18.708
ROUND TWO
REALLY BEGINS

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:23.046
-One, two, three.
-Kim Donghyun.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:24.681
Oh, please.

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.149
-One, two...
-Kim Yuna.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.453
One, two, three.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.789
-This guy... I really...
-[producer] Wrong!

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:35.191
-This guy... I really...
-[producer] Wrong!

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.026
I met him with Cho Saeho.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.463
I met him.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:46.402
-As you know, games like this...
-I really suck at this. I'm doomed.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:47.670
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:49.005
Jung Kook, you go first.

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:50.507
-Please.
-It's better that way.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.642
I'm really bad at this though.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:53.710
[producer] Here we go.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.747
-One, two...
-Park Jisung.

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:00.316
-[producer] One, two, three.
-Cha Eunwoo.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.285
Dongmin.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.554
-Dongmin.
-[producer] One, two, three.

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.557
One, two, three.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.559
LAUGHING

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.794
[Jimin] See? You become like that.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.830
-This is not easy.
-I know her, but...

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:15.899
I'm truly rooting for you.

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.635
-The visual queen of Running Man.
-Right.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:19.736
-How could you?
-Yeah.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:21.938
-This is driving me nuts.
-Here we go.

01:07:22.005 --> 01:07:23.973
-You want to go first?
-I'll try.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.843
-[producer] One, two, three.
-Jimin?

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.378
CORRECT

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.880
EXCITED TO SEE HIMSELF POP UP

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:33.116
[producer] Here we go. One, two...

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:35.051
-I can't see it.
-One, two, three.

01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:36.886
-Wrong.
-Lee Hyun? Hyun?

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:39.255
Let's be honest.
This photo came out too good.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.594
Lee Hyun might feel a bit upset.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:49.232
This photo came out too good.
I actually saw him at home recently.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.068
This was when he was way skinnier though.

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:55.772
-Now, he's way bulkier.
-It doesn't look like him.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:56.839
[producer] Here we go.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.474
One, two...

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.109
One, two, three.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.412
-Wrong!
-Wonwoo, Wonwoo.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.546
Uh...

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:04.614
I'm sorry.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.549
[Jimin and Jung Kook laughing]

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.285
I've always felt this about this game.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:12.455
-It's hard.
-It only brings pain to each other.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.991
-It only hurts people's feelings.
-I'm sorry.

01:08:15.058 --> 01:08:19.562
[producer] Let's say it's 7:42 a.m.
in the staff chat for now.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:21.197
Let's try to push it to 8:00 a.m.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:22.265
Who's going first?

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:23.800
-You go first.
-Okay.

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:24.934
No, I'll go first.

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:28.371
-You're a bit better.
-I'm better? Nah.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.441
-[producer] One, two, three.
-Okay, this is...

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.477
-One, two, three.
-Okay, this is...

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.746
Isn't it Park Bogum?

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:38.648
It is.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:41.050
FREEZE IN SHOCK

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.419
-It's Park Bogum.
-I mean, this one's easy.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.989
-Yeah.
-I mean, I was so...

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.891
So this is what it means to be mesmerized.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:50.226
Just now...

01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:52.562
Wow, you're seriously handsome, Bogum.

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:55.765
Let's go with 10 minutes per image.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.568
-10 minutes each? Let's focus.
-I'll focus.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.705
[producer] Since it's 10 minutes
per image, you'll do this together.

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.841
-Got it.
-[producer] Here we go.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.175
FOCUSED MODE ON

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.310
One, two...

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.978
One, two, three.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:11.080
-Jusong... Wow!
-Joo Woojae.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.148
Two, three...

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:14.384
-Jusong... Wow!
-Joo Woojae.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.720
Did he say Stephen Chow?

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.590
Joo Woojae.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.358
-I know.
-Yeah, of course.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.861
He models and does variety shows.

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:27.864
-He even performed a song recently.
-I know.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:30.199
-Let's get up early.
-Yeah.

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.502
Sleeping all the time isn't good.

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.103
[producer] Here we go.

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.041
HWANG HEECHAN

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.342
-That guy.
-That guy.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:41.944
-Soccer.
-Soccer, soccer.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:44.514
Bull, bull.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.416
-Hwang Heechan.
-Hwang Heechan.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.418
-I even saw him in person.
-Right.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.486
-Even said hi.
-Exactly. We were like...

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.422
"One, two, three." "That guy."

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.492
He's probably younger than me.

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:58.528
I sincerely apologize.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:09:59.962
[producer] Here we go.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.598
One, two, three.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:03.700
-Taemin.
-Taemin.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.401
FINALLY EARNED 10 MINUTES

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:07.270
Here we go.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.439
One, two, three.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.907
Al Pacino Dispen.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.508
Two, three.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:13.810
Al Pacino Dispen.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.247
-Oh, it's Mingyu. He's so handsome.
-Mingyu.

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.817
What's with "Al Pacino"?

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:23.653
I'm sorry.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.625
[producer] This one's worth 20 minutes.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.594
-I think it'll be easy.
-Getting longer.

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:32.895
It could be easier.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.798
Relax. I feel like RM might come up.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.266
-Here we go.
-RM or j-hope.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.669
-Clear your mind.
-j-hope.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:40.737
[producer] Here we go.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.639
-One, two, three.
-Park Joonsoo.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.408
-One, two, three.
-Park Joonsoo.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:48.144
WHO IS PD PARK JOON-SOO?

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:50.246
DIRECTOR OF RUN BTS, BON VOYAGE, ETC.

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:51.447
WITH THEM FOR 10 YEARS

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:54.150
-Don't censor it, please.
-Our producer.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:59.088
-Anyway.
-So how many minutes did you earn?

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.325
-72 minutes?
-Then the wake-up time is 8:12 a.m.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:03.826
-It's not bad.
-It's not bad.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:05.795
QUITE SATISFYING RESULT

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:08.564
-Yeah, not bad.
-[producer] Anything you want to do?

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.367
Just an apology, maybe? I feel so bad.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.237
How many people
do we need to apologize to?

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:19.208
Kim Yuna, congratulations on your wedding.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.443
Nam Changhee.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.112
Song Jihyo.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:25.782
-Hwang Heechan.
-Hwang Heechan, yes...

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.050
-To Mingyu, too.
-Mingyu. And Wonwoo.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.219
-Joo Woojae.
-And Joo Woojae.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.687
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.256
This game makes us apologetic.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:34.924
-I'm sorry.
-All right, then.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.528
Let's all wake up at 8:12 a.m. tomorrow.

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.163
What are we doing after?

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.764
Let's just lie down a bit.

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:44.267
-We just have to open our eyes, no?
-You're right.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:48.171
If you're all in bed,
we'll greet the camera and stay in bed.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:50.840
-We talk a lot after waking up.
-True.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:52.241
Wait, do we?

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.112
[producer] Let's just have breakfast.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.613
-Breakfast?
-[producer] Okay.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.515
[producer] You all did great today.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.417
-See you tomorrow morning.
-Gosh.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.286
-Yes.
-We arrived here today, right?

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.621
-Right?
-Shall we clap?

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.258
-Great job.
-Great job.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.327
-Let's have fun in Switzerland.
-Sure.

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:12.595
One, two, three.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:15.765
AFTER THE GAME

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.234
[Jimin] Hold on.
There's no air conditioner?

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.004
JUNG KOOK ORGANIZING HIS STUFF

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.640
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah? Yes.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.910
-[in English] Why?
-I brought this.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.847
[Jimin] Where do we plug it in?

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:33.883
-[in Korean] What? A fan or something?
-Isn't it kind of hot?

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.285
Too bad we don't have a power strip.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.521
See? I packed it for a reason.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.123
Maybe plug it in outside? It's long.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.126
Not long enough?

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.063
A MYSTERIOUS ITEM FROM THE STAFF

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:50.199
-[Jimin] Isn't that a speaker?
-It works as a speaker, too?

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.168
It's Bluetooth.

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:55.304
-So it's a speaker.
-Hey, it's so hot.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.874
Can we just plug this in real quick?

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.108
[Jung Kook] It's on.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:00.409
FAN ON

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.845
-[Jimin] Like this...
-Oh, it's cool.

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.313
Not bad.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.115
It'll be cooler if we put it back...

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:09.285
THE CABLE'S TOO SHORT

01:13:09.352 --> 01:13:10.953
We should sleep close to it.

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:15.625
Wait, then how are we
going to charge our phones?

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:18.527
-Let's do it tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:21.397
Or there's another way.

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:24.367
Charge them outside
and sleep without our phones.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.968
THE RELIEF PITCHER ENTERS

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.104
But the thing is... Because of this...

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.474
-That one on the floor.
-Can I just take it out?

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.409
UNPLUGGED THE WRONG THING

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:34.810
CULTURE SHOCK

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.079
We both thought it was a speaker.

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:38.748
It does everything.

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:41.050
That was very Jung Kook...
No, not Jung Kook.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:42.518
Totally Jeon Jung Kook.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.588
FAN SPINNING NICE AND COOL

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.058
-[Jimin] Feel cooler now?
-Yeah.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.793
[Jimin] Good, good.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.696
READY FOR BED

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:54.797
This pillow...

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.901
It's really low.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:00.569
THE PILLOW IS TOO LOW

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.271
What the...

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.273
It's barely even a pillow.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.608
WHY IS IT SO UNCOMFORTABLE?

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:07.810
Fold it in half.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:11.614
FIRST BATTLE WITH THE PILLOW

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.485
[muttering]

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.553
[Jimin] What?

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.691
I should fold it in thirds.

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.260
SECOND BATTLE WITH THE PILLOW

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:29.799
Good.

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.133
FULLY SATISFIED

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.136
RESTING IN TOTAL COMFORT

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.605
Should we open the window?

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.908
You think bugs won't get in?

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.576
There might be a screen...

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.211
Nope, no screen.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:44.814
BLOCKING BUGS WITH THE CURTAIN

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.948
Close it and...

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.386
Okay.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:55.358
[Jimin sighing]

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.026
This feels so nice.

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:00.696
[Jung Kook] Omok?

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:02.264
[Jimin] Bring it on.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.666
LATE-NIGHT OMOK MATCH BEGINS

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:06.602
You can't win unless I go easy on you.

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:08.738
A three-word room name?

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.006
Are You Sure?!

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.475
-[Jung Kook] Are You Sure?!
-Yes.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.310
[Jung Kook in English] Okay.

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.379
[in Korean] So you put it here?

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.448
I don't hesitate at all.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.450
I'm not stopping.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.219
So annoying.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:26.055
What now? How are you going to block that?

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:29.658
WHILE THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY UNFOLDS...

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:34.430
MORNING SLOWLY BREAKS OVER SWITZERLAND

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:39.301
A WARM SUN WELCOMES
THE SECOND DAY IN SWITZERLAND

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:42.271
WHAT KIND OF JOURNEY AWAITS TODAY?

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:45.674
CURRENT TIME

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:48.310
STILL SLEEPING

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:52.448
WAKE-UP BUGLE ON

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:03.292
WAKE-UP MISSION TIME

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.330
[Jimin] Sergeants at end of his service
ignore it. They never wake up to it.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:12.334
Sergeants at the end of his service
can sleep even with that sound.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.402
[Jung Kook] Really?

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:14.737
What time is it...

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.305
right now?

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:18.474
GAVE TWO EXTRA MINUTES
CURRENTLY 8:14 A.M.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:22.711
Okay, time to wake up now.
You should go to have breakfast.

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:26.048
Okay. I'm going to eat. I need some food.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.018
What do you think? Are you with me?

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.152
REFUSING THE MISSION

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:31.654
[producer] Sergeant Park Jimin.

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:34.924
-Who is it?
-Sergeant Park Jimin.

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:38.260
Who even are you?
Do you have a death wish?

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:43.299
-[producer] Get ready and come out now.
-[Jung Kook] Okay.

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:46.335
[Jung Kook in English] Let's go.
[in Korean] I'm heading out.

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:47.436
What's wrong?

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:48.671
HEADING OUT FOR BREAKFAST

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:50.005
What's wrong?

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.441
TRYING TO GO BUT CAN'T

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:53.576
What's wrong?

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.010
WANDERING HAND GESTURES

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.412
[Jung Kook] Oh, it's working.

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.914
I tried it earlier, but it didn't work.

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:01.851
Quiet. It's too early for all this.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:05.221
What... Was I being too loud?

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.089
Was I too loud?

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:10.192
FINALLY MOVING TO THE DINING HALL

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.695
[humming]

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:13.762
Hold on.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.298
There you go.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.535
If it loses the subject,
you double-click it.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:22.404
Then it locks right onto
whoever's in the center.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.106
-Double-click it?
-Yeah.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.910
GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE CAMERA

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.246
[Jung Kook] But it's looking good.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.514
HUNGRY FEET HURRYING ALONG

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.517
-Hold on. Why is it so cold?
-It's so nice.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.452
The breakfast area is...

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:37.987
Hey, Jung Kook.

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.822
You're going the wrong way.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:41.290
This way.

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:42.691
That way?

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:43.759
YEAH

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:50.366
Jung Kook, this way. Follow me.
Just follow me. Right here.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:51.901
FROM THE CAMERAMAN'S POV

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:54.270
These staff members walk fast.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.705
-When did they get over there?
-Want me

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.309
-to show you how fast they walk?
-Yes.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.946
CUTIE-SEXY-LOVELY FAST-WALKING SKILL

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.981
[both laughing]

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:08.450
FINDING HIM HILARIOUS

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.221
Is this the place?

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:13.756
ENTERING THE HALL

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.558
[in English] Blueberry, blueberry.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.293
[in Korean] Start with plain yogurt.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.461
Can I pour coffee in this?

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.534
[Jimin] A man enjoying coffee
in the sunlight.

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:31.941
A REFINED MAN SIPPING COFFEE UNDER THE SUN

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.080
A classy man
who knows how to savor coffee?

01:18:39.682 --> 01:18:40.816
READY TO ENJOY BREAKFAST

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.219
-That was hard.
-Welcome.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.654
Why don't you eat breakfast?

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:47.990
It's usually my sleeping time.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.091
[Jung Kook] Hmm.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.859
The sun's really strong.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.329
I'll check the temperature for you.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:55.497
Back in Korea...

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.733
-It gets hottest around 1:00 p.m.
-Yeah.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.704
-But here, the peak is around 5:00 p.m.
-Okay.

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.707
Then it slowly starts to cool off
at 6:00 p.m.

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:05.808
I see.

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:08.611
What are you going to eat with 50 francs?

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.679
Should we look it up?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.147
Highest-rated.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:16.218
There's a place nearby
that sells burgers and sandwiches.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:19.421
-Burgers are popular.
-I'm down for burgers.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.191
They say the staff here is friendly
and the food is great.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:25.694
FOODIE ALWAYS THINKS ABOUT
WHAT TO EAT NEXT WHILE EATING

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.363
-[Jimin humming]

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.430
This is good.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:32.234
DEVOURING IT

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:34.336
The croissant is so good.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.572
Why is the blueberry jam good?

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.475
AN UNEXPECTED LIVE EATING SHOW

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.510
[Jung Kook] Nice. This is a great start.

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:42.578
Let's go.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:44.113
-[Jimin] Let's go.
-Thanks.

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.347
FINISHED BREAKFAST NICELY

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.150
The weather's really nice.

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:51.420
It's chilly but warm at the same time.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:56.592
[humming]

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.260
Hold on.

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:00.329
Where was it again?

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.132
What's wrong with me?

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:08.871
LOST AND WANDERING

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:11.173
[Jimin exclaims]

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.109
WILL JIMIN BE ABLE TO
FIND HIS WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL?

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.177
Help.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:20.049
EXCITING DAY TWO IN SWITZERLAND

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:22.885
ECHOING ACROSS THE EMERALD LAKE...

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:26.155
A PLAYFUL BACK-AND-FORTH?

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.756
ZOOM ZOOM

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:28.991
SPEECHLESS

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:30.626
Goodbye, then!

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.595
[Jung Kook] Is this a declaration of war?

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:36.198
AND SO BEGINS THE CHASE BETWEEN THE TWO

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:38.033
WHO WILL WIN THIS CHASE?

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:39.368
ARE YOU SURE?!

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.836
