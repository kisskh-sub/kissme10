I said I'd take care of it.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.051
Didn't I tell you not to get
your hands wet?

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.086
Go inside and get some rest.

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.121
I just got here,
and I can shower right away?

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.923
Sure. I'll clean everything up.

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:39.427
Seo Dae Kang, I really, really love you.

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:40.395
You're so cute.

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:44.065
I'm cute, but I'm sexy too.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.967
Are you going with "cute and sexy?"

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.235
- Yeah.
- Come here.

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:48.403
Where are we going?

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:51.640
Hey, wait. I haven't showered yet.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.375
It's fine, just come.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.543
Right here?

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.678
You're so dirty. Go wash up already.

00:00:56.678 --> 00:00:57.712
What is this?

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:00.215
Hey, clean this up. What is all this?

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.551
Just look at this place.

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.319
Shouldn't you be the one cleaning that up?

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:06.321
You're the one who ate that.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:07.722
But I was on duty.

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.090
So what?

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:13.595
Damn it.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:19.701
This is driving me crazy.

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:22.404
I'm not doing it.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:24.906
Hey, where are you?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.808
Why aren't you coming?

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.314

Seo Dae Kang!

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:43.291
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.861
I was hungry. I'm sorry.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:01.142
Yes, sir?

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:02.544
Yes.

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:06.248
Okay, I'll head there right away. Yes.

- She hung up.

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.241
I'll wrap things up cleanly
with Seo Dae Kang by the end of this year,

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:07.742
and start fresh next year.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:10.846
Give it another thought.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.181
Jenny is only five years old.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.285
Dae Kang can be frustrating sometimes,
but he has a kind heart.

00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:20.222
What's left to think about?
It's already over.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.757
A kind heart? No way.

00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:24.092
I can't even.

00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:28.463
You're an animal communicator or whatever,

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:31.199
and you appear on "Duck Heaven."
You're doing fine.

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:35.337

I wanted to keep working at the zoo too.

Mom.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:45.981
Jenny, why are you awake?

00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:48.517
Was it noisy? Sorry.

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:51.786
When is Dad coming?

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:53.121
I miss him.

Jenny, let's go back inside.
I'll tuck you in.

00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:00.695

Why do you keep calling me?

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:24.452
Honey.

00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:28.824

Hey, honey.

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:12.567
I told you to fix that habit
of never closing the door properly.

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.504
You never do anything right.

00:05:15.504 --> 00:05:16.505
So what now?

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.707
Just help me this once.

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.810
How long do you expect me
to keep cleaning up after you?

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:25.413
If I get fired over this,
how am I supposed to pay child support?

00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:29.217
Are you even human?

00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:30.652
You're using child support to threaten me?

00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:33.355
I'm not threatening you
with child support.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.825
We should send Jenny
to take ballet classes, don't we?

00:05:37.192 --> 00:05:38.293
Shut up.

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:42.531
You take care of everything.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:44.132
Hey.

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.169
You should've reported it.
Why did you call me?

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:48.837
Damn it.

00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:51.973
If I report it,
they might shoot Sun Jeong.

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:01.483
We still raised her together.

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:06.888
She followed you the most
like you were her mom.

00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:08.623
She did.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.829
Sun Jeong.

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:15.564
Here.

00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:17.432
Sun Jeong, this way.

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:18.366
Sun Jeong.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.204

- Come here.
- Sun Jeong.

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.214
No, come to...

00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:33.782
You're here.

00:06:33.782 --> 00:06:35.016

00:06:38.153 --> 00:06:38.887
Hey.

I feed you and clean up your poop
every single day,

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.494
but you only react when Dal Rae calls you.

00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:46.995
Do you like her more than me?

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.532
Sun Jeong likes me more. Isn't it obvious?

00:06:51.967 --> 00:06:52.934
Unbelievable.

00:06:55.437 --> 00:06:58.206
I do everything by myself,
and I still don't matter at all.

00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:01.776
And I like you more.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.649

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:08.884
Really?

00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:20.328
Are you really going to let
Sun Jeong die and...

00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:21.596
Damn it.

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:24.399
Hey.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:26.034
What is wrong with you?

00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:28.370
How long do I have to clean up your shit?

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.005
I'm so sick of this.

00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:31.439
- It hurts.
- Hey.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:33.842
Why do I always have to suffer?

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:36.611
I had it hard too.

00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:38.613
What was hard for you?

00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:40.715
This whole mess is because of you.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.818
Fine.

00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:44.586
Kill me.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.589
- Kill me too, go ahead.
- Okay, then.

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:49.457
Go on, die.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:50.725
Yeah, kill me too.

00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.060
- You really want to die?
- Do it.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.028
You little...

00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:58.567
Is that Sun Jeong?

00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:01.336
Yeah.

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:02.304
Let's go.

00:08:07.242 --> 00:08:10.579
You're unbelievably good
at sniffing out poop.

00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:13.281
Why did she poop so much?

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:15.684
Is she constipated?

00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:17.619
She probably ate a lot.

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:20.989
No.

00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:23.024
That warmth.

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:25.026
That smell.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.761
That look.

00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:29.698
She definitely pooped not long ago.

00:08:31.132 --> 00:08:32.601
She's still nearby.

00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:34.202
Look at you.

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:42.410
You've never fired a tranquilizer gun
before. What are you going to do?

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.613
Hey, I served in the military.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.780
Besides,

00:08:46.748 --> 00:08:48.283
we probably won't even need to use it.

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:51.019
Even if I don't know much,
you're here with me.

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:52.521
Wake up.

00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:54.322
Sun Jeong is a full-grown wolf.

00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:56.458
A hungry wolf that just pooped.

00:08:58.827 --> 00:08:59.761
Wait.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.667
If she pooped that much,
she must be hungry now, right?

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.105
What was Sun Jeong's favorite food?

00:09:11.673 --> 00:09:12.607
Chicken.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.877
Sun Jeong.

00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:18.413
Sun Jeong.

00:09:19.514 --> 00:09:21.416
Sun Jeong, it's me.

00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:24.352
- Hey.
- What?

00:09:24.352 --> 00:09:26.655
Do you even know what my favorite food is?

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:30.225
How could I not?

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.427
You love spicy fish roe stew.

00:09:32.427 --> 00:09:34.796
You go crazy for the cod milt in it.

00:09:36.798 --> 00:09:37.766
So you do know.

00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:41.169
Excuse me.

00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:43.405
Then do you? Do you know what I like?

00:09:44.506 --> 00:09:45.707
Of course I do.

00:09:45.707 --> 00:09:47.309
Black bean noodles,
pork cutlet, and spicy pork.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:49.077
Every guy's top three, right?

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:50.178
Unbelievable.

00:09:51.046 --> 00:09:53.448
I like spicy fish roe stew too.

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.916
I love cod milt too.

00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:57.419
You don't even eat milt.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.954
You said pollock roe was your favorite.

00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:07.896
Do you really like milt?

00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:20.041
I like spicy fish roe stew and cod...

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.546
Is someone there?

00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:26.748
- How do I turn this off?
- What is it?

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:28.216
What?

00:10:29.284 --> 00:10:30.986
My eyes are getting blurry.

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:33.155
Did I see that wrong?

00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:41.163
Goodness.

00:10:45.934 --> 00:10:48.770
If they find out she escaped,
I'm finished.

00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:54.075
What was that earlier?

00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:56.511
Do you really like milt?

00:10:58.346 --> 00:10:59.281
Yeah.

00:11:00.382 --> 00:11:01.983
Because you liked it so much,

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:04.186
I said I didn't like it
and gave it all to you.

00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:05.153
So what?

00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:08.423
Really?

00:11:10.592 --> 00:11:11.526
Yeah.

00:11:15.664 --> 00:11:16.832
Are you stupid?

00:11:17.132 --> 00:11:18.600
How was I supposed to know
if you never said anything?

00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:20.769
We could've just ordered extra milt.

00:11:21.503 --> 00:11:22.871
What's the point of that?

00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:25.373
I was going to give you all of it anyway.

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:27.843
Back then.

00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:31.079
What are you saying?

00:11:33.748 --> 00:11:36.351
I just want a hot bowl
of spicy fish roe soup...

00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:38.286
loaded with cod milt and pollock roe.

00:11:40.555 --> 00:11:42.390
We can go eat it together later.

00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:53.702
Goodness.

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:58.173
I thought I heard something.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.375
Maybe I imagined it.

00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:10.785
Sorry.

00:12:15.357 --> 00:12:18.660
But have you lost weight?
You seem thinner.

00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.966
Are you still taking meds?

00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.404
Do you even know
what kind of medication that was?

00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:33.074
Hey, I...

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:35.310
No.

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.412
Goodness.

00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:40.815
Mom. What's wrong?

00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:43.485
Mother?

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:46.555
Jenny woke up crying all of a sudden,

00:12:47.422 --> 00:12:49.157
and she's burning up with a fever.

00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:50.425
What should we do?

00:12:51.593 --> 00:12:54.429
Mom, there's a fever reducer
in the kitchen cabinet.

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:55.463
I'll be there right away.

00:12:56.698 --> 00:12:57.799
Wait.

00:12:57.799 --> 00:12:58.834
Jenny's sick.

00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:01.570
If you leave now, you'll get caught.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.138
I said Jenny's sick.

00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:05.407
Wait. If you go now, he'll notice.
Just a second.

00:13:08.176 --> 00:13:11.146
Hey, you always put yourself first,
don't you?

00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:12.314
What?

00:13:12.514 --> 00:13:14.549
You didn't eat milt because I liked it?

00:13:14.883 --> 00:13:16.451
If you really liked it,

00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:18.220
you would've eaten it all yourself.

00:13:20.989 --> 00:13:23.859
What did I do so wrong this time?

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.761
Jenny is sick.

00:13:27.362 --> 00:13:29.297
But you stopped me
because you're scared you'll get caught...

00:13:29.297 --> 00:13:30.832
and it'll blow back on you.

00:13:30.832 --> 00:13:33.668
Right now, you matter more to you
than your sick daughter.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.438
Hey.

00:13:36.771 --> 00:13:39.708
Is asking you to wait a minute
really such an unforgivable thing?

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:40.675
Hey.

00:13:41.109 --> 00:13:43.879
If you hadn't messed up
and dragged me out here,

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:45.647
I'd be with Jenny right now.

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:48.383
Honestly,

00:13:50.318 --> 00:13:51.887
I'm the idiot...

00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:54.289
for marrying someone like you
and having a kid.

00:13:58.493 --> 00:13:59.227
Hey.

00:14:00.328 --> 00:14:01.363
Hey.

00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:02.464
Don't call me "hey."

00:14:02.464 --> 00:14:04.699
We're not together anymore,
and I'm older than you.

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:06.301
Are you done talking?

00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:13.508
Seriously.

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:17.779
Have you ever acknowledged me even once?

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:18.580
Have you?

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:21.416
I did my best too.

00:14:22.384 --> 00:14:23.885
I tried my best.

00:14:26.688 --> 00:14:28.924
What did you try your best at?

00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:31.593
You kept your job.

00:14:32.027 --> 00:14:33.728
But my entire career got cut off.

00:14:34.663 --> 00:14:36.298
Do you know how much I...

00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:37.766
How much...

00:14:41.603 --> 00:14:44.105
Forget it.

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:46.107
What's the point
of talking about this now?

00:14:46.842 --> 00:14:49.878
Whether you find Sun Jeong or not,
do whatever you want.

00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:01.389
(Staff Only,
Authorized Personnel Only)

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:04.192
Go check on Jenny
and let me know what's...

00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:05.160
Chief Seo.

00:15:07.863 --> 00:15:08.930
Yes, sir.

00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:10.465
What are you doing here?

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:14.436
Who is this?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.575
Her.

00:15:20.575 --> 00:15:21.376
That person.

00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:24.012
She's my...

00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:25.714
wife.

00:15:26.414 --> 00:15:27.449
Hello.

00:15:29.251 --> 00:15:30.252
I see.

00:15:30.952 --> 00:15:32.787
But what brings you here at this hour?

00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:35.323
Well,

00:15:35.323 --> 00:15:36.324
so,

00:15:36.324 --> 00:15:39.194
I'm on duty tonight,

00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:41.429
and Sun...

00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:43.498
Sun...

00:15:43.498 --> 00:15:45.534
I brought some soondae.

00:15:46.535 --> 00:15:47.502
Soondae?

00:15:47.502 --> 00:15:48.303
Yes.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.740
He kept saying he was starving.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.809
Look at this belly.
It's all late-night snacking.

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:56.378
Right?

00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:58.914
- Then we'll get going.
- Yes.

00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:02.083
Wait a moment.

00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:07.856
By any chance...

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.791
Yes?

00:16:15.564 --> 00:16:17.465
"Animal Heaven."

00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:19.467
You were on that show, right?

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:21.703
The one who found that cat.

00:16:22.637 --> 00:16:23.405
Yes.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:28.944
I cried so much watching that episode.

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:30.178
But...

00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:32.180
can you actually communicate
with animals telepathically?

00:16:33.982 --> 00:16:37.152
Well, it's not exactly telepathy.

00:16:37.486 --> 00:16:39.788
It's more about empathy,
understanding how the animal feels.

00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:44.326
Why would someone who understands that
do something like this?

00:16:46.828 --> 00:16:49.064
Anyway, it's an honor to meet you.

00:16:49.064 --> 00:16:50.031
Thank you.

00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:53.134
- Chief Seo.
- Yes, sir.

00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:55.170
Let's have a drink with some soondae
in the on-call room later.

00:16:56.338 --> 00:16:57.639
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:00.609
Good luck to you too.

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:01.843
Yes, thanks.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:04.880
I'll head out.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.215
Enjoy some time alone together.

00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:14.456
A drink in the on-call room?

00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:17.492
What now, what is it?

00:17:19.728 --> 00:17:20.929
You never change.

00:17:21.263 --> 00:17:24.099
You like drinking your butt off
more than your wife and kid.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:25.667
Drinking my butt off?

00:17:26.067 --> 00:17:28.203
Are you going to keep talking like that?

00:17:28.703 --> 00:17:30.605
Are you going to keep turning me
into trash?

00:17:30.605 --> 00:17:32.407
You are trash.

00:17:32.407 --> 00:17:35.110
I was up every night until dawn
feeding the baby,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.778
while you were out drinking,

00:17:36.778 --> 00:17:38.914
pulling all-nighters
and crawling home at sunrise.

00:17:38.914 --> 00:17:41.349
Why do you think I ended up like that?

00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:44.586
Did you ever even treat me
like a human being when you were pregnant?

00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:45.921
I can't even.

00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:49.858
By someone you once loved,

00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:52.160
being stared at every day
like you're something to be killed.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.628
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

00:17:53.628 --> 00:17:55.597
Forget it.

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:57.532
Even talking about this
is a waste of time.

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:00.435
Whether you drink your butt off
or look for Sun Jeong,

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:01.937
clean up your own mess.

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:05.407
Fine. Go.

00:18:05.407 --> 00:18:07.142
Go.

00:18:07.142 --> 00:18:08.743
I hope you run into Sun Jeong on the way.

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:10.645
- You little...
- Stop.

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:14.749
How's Jenny?

00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:17.452
Her fever went down a bit
after the medicine.

00:18:17.452 --> 00:18:18.787
That's a relief.

00:18:18.787 --> 00:18:20.121
Yeah, I'm heading over now.

00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:21.289
About 30 minutes.

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:31.466
Hello?

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:32.400
Dal Rae.

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:35.637
Where did she go?

00:18:36.238 --> 00:18:37.606
Since I don't hear any cries,

00:18:37.606 --> 00:18:39.274
it doesn't seem like anyone's noticed yet.

00:18:42.978 --> 00:18:45.847
The more I think about Yoo Dal Rae,
the angrier I get.

00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:49.084
What, try seeing it from her side?

00:18:49.584 --> 00:18:52.521
She should try it first.

00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:18.613
Why are you just getting home now?

00:19:21.449 --> 00:19:23.118
You scared me.

00:19:25.287 --> 00:19:26.655
Did you drink again?

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:30.592
No, I didn't. I was working late.

00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:31.660
Yeah?

00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.162
If that's what you say.

00:19:36.364 --> 00:19:37.399
Hey, Yoo Dal...

00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:52.514
Should I have mentioned
I knew back then?

00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:54.816
Whatever.

00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:56.384
Whatever.

00:20:11.199 --> 00:20:12.133
Sun Jeong.

00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:15.203
It's me, Dal Rae.

00:20:18.006 --> 00:20:19.174
Don't you remember me?

00:20:37.826 --> 00:20:38.760
Yeah.

00:20:41.963 --> 00:20:43.965
We used to be really happy together.

00:20:47.335 --> 00:20:48.403
Yeah.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.545
Good girl.

00:21:23.805 --> 00:21:25.440
Let's go back.

00:21:26.074 --> 00:21:26.875
Okay?

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:30.178
You can't wander around like this.

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:40.622
Why did she poop so much?
Is she constipated?

00:21:45.093 --> 00:21:46.094
Sun Jeong.

00:21:48.163 --> 00:21:49.297
Are you...

00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:18.527
Sun Jeong.

00:22:28.703 --> 00:22:29.938
Sun Jeong, no!

00:22:36.044 --> 00:22:38.246
Dal Rae, are you okay?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.448
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:22:40.448 --> 00:22:41.416
Let me see.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.287
You asshole. I almost died because of you.

00:22:45.287 --> 00:22:47.355
Yeah, I'm the asshole.

00:22:47.355 --> 00:22:48.657
I'm sorry.

00:22:48.657 --> 00:22:50.192
You're okay though, right?

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.234
Sun Jeong.

00:23:00.735 --> 00:23:03.038
I didn't think she'd go after you too.

00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:11.046
This won't do. We need to report it.

00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:22.057
(Chief Seo)

00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:25.894
Why isn't this guy answering his phone?

00:23:29.397 --> 00:23:30.265
Wait.

00:23:32.334 --> 00:23:33.869
I think Sun Jeong might be pregnant.

00:23:34.736 --> 00:23:35.604
What?

00:23:36.404 --> 00:23:37.239
Hold on.

00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:47.148
She may have escaped to make a nest.

00:23:59.127 --> 00:24:00.662
Damn it.

00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:04.099
Why does everything I do
turn out like this?

00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:09.704
With you and Sun Jeong,
there's nothing I ever get right.

00:24:09.704 --> 00:24:10.739
It's okay.

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.908
It might not have shown.

00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:18.380
If I had checked more carefully,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.316
And actually,

00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:25.253
I knew you were taking medication.

00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:27.389
What?

00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:32.227
No, I didn't. I was working late.

00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:34.262
Hey, Yoo Dal...

00:24:50.378 --> 00:24:51.680
(Psychotropic medication)

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.548
(Treatment for depression, anxiety,
and obsessive-compulsive disorder)

00:24:53.882 --> 00:24:55.016
Panic disorder...

00:24:57.986 --> 00:25:01.389
I think I just didn't want to know
any more than that.

00:25:02.057 --> 00:25:02.858
I was afraid...

00:25:03.758 --> 00:25:05.494
that if I showed I knew,

00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:09.831
it would confirm
that what I knew was right.

00:25:12.067 --> 00:25:14.202
So I pretended not to know. I'm sorry.

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:28.416
You...

00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:39.594
Did you ever treat me
like a human being when you were pregnant?

00:25:40.095 --> 00:25:43.565
By someone you once loved, being stared at
like you're something to be killed.

00:25:43.565 --> 00:25:45.033
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

00:25:50.238 --> 00:25:51.406
Seo Dae Kang, get up.

00:25:53.742 --> 00:25:54.676
Get up.

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:02.017
Today,

00:26:03.018 --> 00:26:05.954
when I saw Sun Jeong
get agitated and lunge,

00:26:07.322 --> 00:26:09.524
what you said back then
suddenly came to mind.

00:26:10.892 --> 00:26:12.427
Back then,

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:15.263
I thought I was the only victim.

00:26:17.032 --> 00:26:18.900
I understood animals' feelings,

00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:21.636
but I didn't understand yours.

00:26:23.805 --> 00:26:24.806
I'm sorry too.

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:35.150
No.

00:26:38.086 --> 00:26:39.988
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:26:41.156 --> 00:26:42.624
It was all my fault.

00:26:44.826 --> 00:26:45.961
You're overreacting.

00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:51.132
I was a coward.

00:26:52.334 --> 00:26:53.802
I was wrong.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.605
I'm the one to blame.

00:26:57.572 --> 00:26:58.607
Dal Rae.

00:26:59.474 --> 00:27:01.376
I should've held you.

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:02.377
What's gotten into you?

00:27:02.978 --> 00:27:04.179
Give me a hug.

00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:07.449
Why are you being like this?
What do you mean, give you a hug?

00:27:08.316 --> 00:27:11.453
Stop it. I'm not hugging you.

00:27:11.453 --> 00:27:12.487
Give me a kiss.

00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:15.257
Hey.

00:27:16.057 --> 00:27:16.825
Hey.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.695
Right.

00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:22.831
Sun Jeong's comfort toy.

00:27:42.551 --> 00:27:44.719
She's pregnant,
so we can't use a tranquilizer.

00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:45.687
Right.

00:27:46.488 --> 00:27:48.089
Damn it.

00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:50.826
Okay.

00:27:51.693 --> 00:27:52.727
I'll lure her.

00:27:53.028 --> 00:27:55.430
- What?
- That's the best option...

00:27:56.298 --> 00:27:57.999
for you, Jenny, and Sun Jeong.

00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:01.002
Are you insane?

00:28:01.403 --> 00:28:03.638
If you die, I'm the one
who has to deal with the aftermath.

00:28:03.638 --> 00:28:04.539
Then what do you want me to do?

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.842
What do you think?
We find her and send her back safely.

00:28:07.075 --> 00:28:08.610
Every time I say I'll do something,
you start nagging.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.845
Don't talk nonsense.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.969
Lure her.

00:28:33.969 --> 00:28:34.903
You said you would.

00:28:34.903 --> 00:28:36.204
Dal Rae, you do it. You're older than me.

00:28:36.204 --> 00:28:37.706
Sun Jeong likes you more. Come on.

00:28:37.706 --> 00:28:38.807
You only mention I'm older
at times like these.

00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:42.277
- Jenny needs her mom.
- She needs her dad too.

00:28:42.277 --> 00:28:43.745
Her dad is basically already gone.

00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:45.213
You're the one who kicked him out.

00:28:45.213 --> 00:28:47.048
Then you should've done better sooner.

00:28:49.784 --> 00:28:51.920
Wait. Sun Jeong.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.356
- Get the gun.
- Gun.

00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:56.158
Here's the gun.

00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:57.325
Shoot.

00:28:57.325 --> 00:28:59.094
What? Are you joking right now?

00:29:00.095 --> 00:29:01.530
You're insane. I'm leaving.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.932
No.

00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:05.267
If you're going to die, die on your own.

00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:21.883
That's when I realized.

00:29:25.587 --> 00:29:27.122
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:29:30.125 --> 00:29:31.359
The wedding was brutal.

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:33.261
I thought I was going to starve.

00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:35.764
Here's the cod milt you love so much.

00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:38.033
It's hot.

00:29:40.135 --> 00:29:41.803
It's really good. Try it.

00:29:41.803 --> 00:29:43.438
No, you eat it all. I don't like milt.

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.708
But milt is the best. It's so good.

00:29:49.077 --> 00:29:49.978
It's good.

00:29:51.012 --> 00:29:52.647
I promise to make you happy.

00:29:54.983 --> 00:29:56.084
Let's live well together.

00:29:57.052 --> 00:29:59.054
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:02.624
- Stop giving everything to me.
- Just one more.

00:30:02.624 --> 00:30:04.359
We really did love each other.

00:30:05.327 --> 00:30:06.127
Is it good?

00:30:06.127 --> 00:30:08.196
And when that burning love ended...

00:30:10.365 --> 00:30:12.601
It wasn't just one person's fault.

00:30:25.714 --> 00:30:27.148
- What?
- What?

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.858
Get in.

00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:16.264
Check on Jenny,
and let me know how she is.

00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:18.066
Okay.

00:31:20.769 --> 00:31:22.070
It's gotten colder.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:24.506
Take care.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.041
Yeah.

00:31:27.475 --> 00:31:30.045
Dress warmly. It's cold these days.

00:31:30.045 --> 00:31:31.279
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:31:39.888 --> 00:31:41.189
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:41.923
Okay.

00:31:42.657 --> 00:31:47.562
(Woori Zoo)

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.664
Jenny.

00:31:50.665 --> 00:31:51.733
Wake up.

00:31:52.634 --> 00:31:53.768
Come on, let's go.

00:31:54.603 --> 00:31:56.037
Let's go.

00:31:56.738 --> 00:31:57.806
Mom.

00:31:57.806 --> 00:32:01.610
Hey, my baby.
You got dressed all by yourself?

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.178
Who do you take after to be this pretty?

00:32:03.178 --> 00:32:04.946
(Mom is the bubble queen.
Dad only looks at Jenny.)

00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:06.114
Dad and Mom.

00:32:06.114 --> 00:32:08.283
Not Mom and Dad?

00:32:09.017 --> 00:32:10.886
You're making it hard. Don't ask.

00:32:10.886 --> 00:32:12.087
Let's hurry.

00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:14.022
Okay, let's go.

00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:27.320
