WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.003
[♪ opening theme music playing]

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.628
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.863
[Jimin] Apparently,
we drive this ourselves.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.798
IN BRIENZ, THE MOVIE-LIKE VILLAGE,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.700
THE TWO HAD A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.068
It's really come.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.204
FROM A THRILLING ENCOUNTER
WITH A SCARY SWAN

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:40.240
TO A REFRESHING DIVE FROM THE HOT TUG

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.379
IT'S MORE FUN BECAUSE THEY'RE TOGETHER

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.116
DIGGING IN SINCE IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE THEY HAD KOREAN FOOD

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.720
HAMBURGERS AFTER KOREAN FOOD

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.390
TIME FOR A NEW ACTIVITY NOW

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.958
-You ready?
-[in English] Ready.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.328
-Three, two, one. Jump.
-Two, one.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.765
JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF WITHOUT HESITATION

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.301
IT'S FUN

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.536
Whoa!

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.607
EACH DAY HAS BEEN FUN SO FAR.
WILL THEIR TRIP CONTINUE THIS WAY?

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:17.978
AFTER THE LAKE SWIMMING,
THEY'RE BACK AT THE LODGING

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.379
[in Korean] The ingredients.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.681
They bought many.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.250
How about we make a stew?

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.252
We'll go buy what you need.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.421
-Ingredients for doenjang stew.
-Doenjang stew?

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.056
-Can we make it?
-Why don't I try

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.591
making doenjang stew? No?

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.658
-You want to?
-What?

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.728
-You want to?
-I'll get a recipe online and make some.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.030
-No, you should cook rice.
-You're right.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.132
I'll make both. You can rest up today.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.467
-You sure?
-Yes.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:41.802
THIS IS GREAT

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:42.869
[in English] Okay.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.105
I'll do all the cooking
and let him relax today.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.306
FULL OF CONFIDENCE

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.241
I finally get to repay you.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.477
-[in Korean] I'd like a doenjang stew.
-Okay.

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.379
First for the stew, zucchini...

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:56.483
Zucchini, onion, garlic, minced garlic...

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.986
-I'll wash up first, bro.
-Okay.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.287
JUNG KOOK IS OFF TO WASH UP

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.355
A pot rice recipe.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.422
REVIEWING THE RECIPE

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.624
Pot rice.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.692
It's important to use soaked rice.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.694
SOAKING RICE RIGHT AWAY

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.297
PETIT

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.532
THIS IS TOO SMALL...

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.902
We only have this and...

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.438
There are only these two.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.675
HE DOESN'T GIVE UP
UNTIL HE FINDS THE RIGHT ONE

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:25.045
HE FINDS THE SIZE HE WANTS

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:28.148
THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.452
MEASURING RICE

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.854
SPILLING

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.590
HE'S NOT FLUSTERED...

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.658
One cup.

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:42.496
SPILLING AGAIN

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.032
HE'S QUITE EMBARRASSED

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:50.537
They said you shouldn't wash it too hard.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:53.440
Gently, like this.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.442
Throw the water out first.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.844
GENTLY WASHING IT FOR THE SECOND TIME

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.513
Throw it out again.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.816
WASHING THE RICE FOR THE THIRD TIME

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.017
IT'S DONE

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:07.454
The video I watched says
I need to wash it five times.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:11.258
But my mother told me
to do it only three times. Not too much.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.261
She said, "The rice won't taste good
if you wash it more."

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.130
WASHING THE RICE ONLY THREE TIMES
LIKE HIS MOM SAID

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.733
And I'll wash up for 30 minutes.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.802
Okay, it's done.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.204
HE'S OFF TO SHOWER
WHILE THE RICE SOAKS

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:28.308
WASHING UP FOR A WHILE

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.311
HE'S BACK ALL CLEAN

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.480
-All right.
-Jimin.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.016
-What do you think, sir?
-Keep it on.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.085
Onion, potato, zucchini, gochujang!

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.252
SHOUTING THE INGREDIENTS

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.320
Potato!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.255
-Jung Kook.
-What?

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.890
Roll up my sleeves, please.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.026
-One more time on this side.
-You feel unsure?

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.395
That's not it. Follow me.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.664
[exhales sharply]

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.666
DANCING TO RELIEVE TENSION

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.368
-Out in five. A minute left.
-You didn't need my help.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.436
What?

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.038
-You told me to stay out.
-Go in.

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.106
Okay.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.674
JUNG KOOK LEAVES THE KITCHEN

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.776
GETTING READY TO REST

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:05.712
I'M COUNTING ON YOU

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.949
Here's the thing about cooking.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.051
I don't know what to start with.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:14.588
SUMMONING AN ONLINE TEACHER

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:18.125
SUPER FOCUSED...

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:23.029
HE BEGINS FOLLOWING THE STEPS

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.097
JIMIN'S POT RICE

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.200
1. PUT THE RICE WATER IN THE POT

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.203
CHECKING THE AMOUNT OF WATER

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.473
CHECKING THE VIDEO

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.975
There's one more thing I heard.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:36.843
To this...

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.780
2. COVER THE POT WITH FOIL

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.848
METICULOUS

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:42.916
And then...

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.653
sprinkle some water on it.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.157
3. SPRINKLE SOME WATER ON THE FOIL

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.492
4. COVER IT WITH FOIL AGAIN

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.593
Now...

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.728
Five minutes.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.730
5. BOIL IT FOR FIVE MINUTES

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.834
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO PUT ON THE LID

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.870
MAKING POT RICE HAS BEGUN SMOOTHLY

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:06.606
Jung Kook usually does all the cooking,

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.242
so I'm planning
to keep him away from cooking this time.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.544
All right.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.080
THE MAIN INGREDIENTS FOR THE STEW

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.649
There are tofu and mushrooms.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.285
Let the mushrooms wait for now.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.920
I'm not getting used to it.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.022
HE FEELS AWKWARD IN THE KITCHEN

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.524
HE OBTAINS A CUTTING BOARD

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:26.126
This is a cutting board.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:27.994
And then...

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.697
THE ALARM RINGS TO INFORM FIVE MINUTES

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.966
Okay, 15 minutes from now on.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:34.301
Then, 2.5.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.804
In the meantime,
let's cut some vegetables.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.941
HE BEGINS CUTTING ONIONS

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.443
VERY SERIOUS

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.511
A zucchini.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.815
Like this...

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.651
I don't know how to cut it.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.954
CHECKING THE VIDEO

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.188
Cut it in half.

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:57.858
CUTTING IT ONCE

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.828
THEN, CHECKING THE VIDEO AGAIN

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.096
I see.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:04.898
CUTTING IT AGAIN

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:08.301
HOW TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE BY THE BOOK

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.369
Cut it in half.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:10.437
CHOPPING AN ONION

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.542
HE'S SLOW, BUT HE'S MAKING PROGRESS...

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:19.079
Into big pieces.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.680
How do I cut a potato?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.115
WATCHING THE VIDEO AGAIN

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.050
This must be how to chop a potato.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.685
Then...

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.020
CHOPPING A POTATO COMPLETE

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.488
This is chopping, right?

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.090
I actually have no idea.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.392
And they say it's better to add garlic.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:33.927
So, let me use some.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.196
HE BEGINS MINCING GARLIC

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:37.330
This...

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.901
HIS KNIFE SKILLS SHOWS
HIS CONFIDENCE AND EXPERIENCE

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:45.405
It's not minced, but I guess
I can say it's shredded.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.507
Good. It's pretty much done.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.876
-They didn't have Korean doenjang.
-What?

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.311
Then it might be different.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.179
So it might be a bit sweeter.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.849
Or I can make gochujang stew instead.

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.450
I'll change the dish right away.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.519
HIS COOKING FLEXIBILITY
DESERVES A FULL SCORE

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:00.620
Okay.

00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:03.390
LEARNING THE GOCHUJANG STEW RECIPE
WITHOUT GETTING FLUSTERED

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.058
I don't have chili pepper powder.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.661
Since I don't need sugar,
I better add a bit of this.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.330
Then... Hold on. Another five minutes.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:13.266
I'll open it after four minutes.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.168
Move to this side.

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:17.237
A FRYING PAN'S TURN

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:19.239
A bit of cooking oil.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.674
Just one around of it.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.110
HE GRILLS PORK BELLY FOR THE STEW

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.380
WATCHING THE GOCHUJANG STEW VIDEO AGAIN

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.249
Just enough to change colors.

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:32.018
IT'S TIME TO OPEN THE POT

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.086
[timer chiming]

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.354
Be quiet.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.857
All right, the rice...

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.292
I wonder if it's done.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.529
LET'S SEE...?

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.933
I don't think it's cooked at all.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.102
It seems okay, but it's not okay at all.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.639
Hold on.
I can no longer pay attention to that.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.908
In this case, let's close the lid.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.142
Boil more over low heat.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.545
The meat shouldn't be cooked too much.

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.448
Now, quickly...

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.615
ADDING MINCED GARLIC

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.718
Let's add this much of this.

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.020
Now, let's make it golden brown.

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:08.355
All right, dive in.

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.422
ADDING THE VEGGIES

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.258
STIR-FRYING THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.260
THE KEY TO GOCHUJANG STEW IS GOCHUJANG

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.328
One.

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.663
Two.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.731
Three.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:19.265
Four.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.167
ADDING ONE SPOONFUL OF DOENJANG

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.902
What am I cooking?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.706
Boil hard now, punk. Water will be added.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:30.477
But how do I add a liter of water?

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.213
Wait. Water is... Right.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.582
What milliliter are you?

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.252
A bottle of water is
usually 500 mL, right?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.755
Two bottles will do.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.693
POURING 1 L OF WATER

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.162
JIMIN IS SMOOTHLY SAILING

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.199
NODDING

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.602
A LAUGH OF SOMEONE QUITE SATISFIED

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.037
The problem is the rice.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.572
It's the key dish today.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.807
It's legendary.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.142
CHECKING THE POT RICE AGAIN

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.513
Is it just how this rice is?

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.015
Jung Kook. Should we just eat ramyeon?

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.484
The bottom side is awful.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.787
What do I do? It's hopeless.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.855
I don't think there's a way to save this.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:17.424
Take some out.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.060
THE ELDER STAFF MEMBER COMES TO RESCUE

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.127
Where's uncooked rice?

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:26.833
Gosh, it's...

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.402
MAKING IT ALL OVER AGAIN

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:34.507
It's different. Then, tofu...
Is it okay to put tofu in now?

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.476
Shouldn't it boil harder?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.146
AT EASE

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:44.417
MEANWHILE, IT GETS DARK OUTSIDE

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.388
TAKES OFF OUT OF HUNGER

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:49.522
Jimin.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.990
[Jimin] Stay inside.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.992
Doenjang stew shouldn't take this long.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.061
I changed the dish to gochujang stew.

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.263
It looks quite all right.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.331
It looks a bit bland.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.533
Go.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.634
PUSHING HIM

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.103
-Jimin.
-What?

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.270
I applaud you

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.473
for your hard effort.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:12.345
You know, moms can make a stew
in just 30 or 20 minutes.

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:13.413
Right.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.082
I've been making this for 40 minutes.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:17.417
It's taking that long?

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:20.186
I sure have no talent for cooking.

00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:21.321
Can I have a taste?

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.556
THE EVALUATION TIME HAS FINALLY COME

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.225
NERVOUS

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.360
JUNG KOOK

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.129
HAS A TASTE!

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.331
IT'S ODDLY NERVE-RACKING

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.799
Did you only put gochujang?

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:35.268
-A bit of this.
-Okay.

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:37.003
-Like half a spoonful.
-I see.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.106
-And four big spoonfuls of gochujang.
-Okay.

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.274
Some garlic.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.642
What about pepper powder?

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.177
You want some in?

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:45.912
Maybe just a little.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.814
ADDING PEPPER POWDER TO MEET HIS PALATE

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.816
PEPPER POWDER MARKS THE END OF STEW-MAKING

00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:52.285
HOW IS IT GOING WITH THE POT RICE...?

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:53.853
Wait.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.321
It looks okay.

00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:59.959
IT'S COOKED WELL!

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.561
Let me get you some rice.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.696
Okay. I can't wait.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:04.998
JIMIN'S HEARTY STEW

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.332
AND POT RICE ARE READY

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.600
Jimin.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.935
My first self-made dish.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.237
Take a picture.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.406
Let me.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:14.974
-I...
-I should.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.209
GETTING READY FOR PHOTOS

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.911
I'm sorry.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.112
HIS FIRST SELF-MADE FOOD

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.547
It took too much time.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:23.883
PASSIONATE

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.985
PASSIONATE TOO

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.988
JIMIN'S FIRST SELF-MADE KOREAN FOOD
IN SWITZERLAND

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.089
Should we try it?

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.058
-Okay.
-Let me move it closer.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.529
Looks good.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.798
Let me try the tofu first.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:39.899
TAKING THE TOFU FIRST

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.837
IT'S HOT

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.773
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.641
NODDING SILENTLY

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.977
RELIEVED

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.045
It's good.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:53.613
I'll enjoy.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.747
JIMIN FINALLY CAN ENJOY

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.649
SLURPING TOGETHER

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.718
EVEN HIS BRAIN FEELS THE KOREAN TASTE

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:03.556
Should we add some more salt?

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.258
-Yes.
-Right?

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.493
We need salt. It's a bit bland.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:14.234
ADDING SALT

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.868
-That should be enough.
-Right?

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:19.272
BE MORE DELICIOUS

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:23.009
THEY RESUME EATING WITH NEW INTENTIONS

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:28.248
-Let me have a taste.
-Maybe the fly wants to try your stew too.

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.484
THE FLY HEADS STRAIGHT TO THE STEW

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:33.620
It's approaching like that swan.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.355
IT APPROACHED FAST AND SCARILY

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.422
TARGET

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.890
Wait. It's coming for real.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.263
THE FLY IS HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE TARGET

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:50.303
HIS EYES ARE FIXED

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.939
ASIDE FROM THE FLY, IT'S TO DIE FOR

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.812
THE SALT MADE THE STEW PERFECT

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.381
IT'S DELICIOUS

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:04.484
THE BEST KIND OF FOOD IS
SOMEONE ELSE'S COOKING

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:09.155
HE LOVES HIS OWN COOKING

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.124
IT'S HOT

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:13.426
Is it good?

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.061
At least, the stew...

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.129
LAUGHING SILENTLY

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.998
I messed up the rice. I'm sorry.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:22.268
I bought it this time.
Let's try drinking some.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.973
DRINKING

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.844
IT QUENCHES THEIR THIRST!

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:33.546
REFRESHED

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:35.315
You like sweet things.

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:36.416
This is good.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:37.950
It's coconut water.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.420
[in English] "Original."

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:43.756
-"Made in Indonesia."
-It's refreshing.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.225
We get to have a taste
of something from Indonesia.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.431
Coconut water is
a good source of hydration.

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:55.168
HE LOVES IT

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.602
-Good?
-[in Korean] It's great.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.339
-It's a bit...
-Do you feel a bit refreshed?

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:00.406
Yes, a bit.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:02.975
It'll refresh us nonstop
if we have it after eating.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.043
-Eat...
-Eat...

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.045
-...and drink.
-...and drink.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:09.015
LET'S STOP AND GO BACK TO EATING!

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:10.149
But it's really good.

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.418
-Thanks.
-The potato is chopped so big.

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:14.887
A BITE OF THE UNUSUALLY BIG POTATO PIECE

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.522
Now, let me...

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.091
I like mixing this with rice.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:19.359
It's delicious.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.294
ONCE, TWICE,

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.729
THREE TIMES

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.830
FOUR TIMES

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.365
FIVE TIMES

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:27.867
MIXING THE RICE WITH ENOUGH STEW

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:29.736
STAFF: STOP

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.304
-Before you keep eating...
-Yes?

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.039
WHAT'S THAT IN HIS HANDS?

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:34.440
[director] Stir-fried kimchi.

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.743
A FOUR-SIDE-DISH TRAVEL KIT
FOR KOREAN FOOD LOVERS

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.212
FROM KIMCHI TO IRRESISTIBLE SIDE DISHES

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:41.714
Do we have to win them
or can we just have them?

00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:44.384
PLUS ONE HOUR EACH

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.754
EMPTY LAUGHS FOR MINIMALISM...

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.555
I choose not to have them.

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:52.492
I actually...

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:56.963
But can we take some pork belly
to our destination tomorrow and...

00:14:58.164 --> 00:14:59.399
NO, IT'S A HOTEL

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.500
We can't?

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.201
We need to have it now, then.

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.404
We can't bring it with us?

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.471
We can't.

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:08.040
Ah! Then let me grill some.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.942
STANDING UP TOGETHER

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:13.212
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.448
To leave it behind is...

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.317
That's just not right.

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.586
-Right?
-Of course.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:21.954
You won't do this bet?

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.257
Wait, we'll grill the meat now.

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.893
Let us think after that.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.361
But that'll be three hours.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.296
Two is bad already.

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:34.233
PORK BELLY COMES BEFORE MINIMALISM

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.568
[humming]

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.204
COATING THE POT WITH OIL

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.372
Thirty minutes?

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.908
HEATING THE POT

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.744
HERE COMES THE MEAT

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.480
CHEF JUNG KOOK'S TIP:
GRILL THE MEAT FROM THE SKIN

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:51.484
THE APPETIZING SOUND
OF GRILLING PORK BELLY

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.619
CHECKING

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.055
PRESSING HARD

00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:02.228
WHEN THE SKIN IS COOKED,
GRILL EACH CHUNK SEPARATELY

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:07.033
CAREFULLY ADJUSTING THE HEAT

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.903
SALT

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.374
FLIPPING IT AT THE PERFECT TIMING

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.043
PERFECTLY GRILLED PORK BELLY

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.177
Thirty minutes?

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:20.480
MEANWHILE, JIMIN IS NEGOTIATING

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.849
[director] What do you want the most?

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.584
Kimchi? Right, Jung Kook?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.952
-Kimchi?
-Yes.

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:27.653
-That sounds nice.
-Yes.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.388
-You want kimchi the most?
-Yes.

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:32.625
DIGITAL MINIMALISM
+1 HOUR

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:34.794
[director] What do you want the least?

00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:36.128
Stir-fried kimchi.

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.164
[director] One hour for stir-fried kimchi.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.267
Gosh, how cruel.

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.970
Jung Kook, how's one hour for kimchi?

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:45.738
-That's not bad.
-Okay.

00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:47.306
ADDING ONE MORE HOUR FOR KIMCHI

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:48.708
Gosh, three hours?

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:50.776
It's like the military.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.312
ONE HOUR ADDED TO DIGITAL MINIMALISM

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.648
THE PORK BELLY IS GRILLED GOLDEN BROWN

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.619
QUICKLY HAVING A PIECE

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.686
This is it.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.089
Pork belly with gochujang stew.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.924
Right?

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:09.695
This is how a meal should be.

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.231
THE BEST FOOD COMBINATION FOR JUNG KOOK

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.901
HAVING A SPOONFUL OF RICE FIRST

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.103
AND ONE MORE

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:20.239
The stew was missing meat,
and the pork belly makes up for it.

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.708
THEN THE PORK BELLY

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:24.043
Is this plain kimchi?

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.811
Not stir-fried?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.079
It's a bit aged.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.348
HOW'S THE KIMCHI THEY GOT
IN RETURN FOR ONE HOUR?

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.584
FANTASTIC

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:32.652
Jung Kook.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.120
YOU'RE WONDERFUL, BRO

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.655
It's nice to have pork belly.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.822
FULL RESPECT

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.725
-What?
-This grilled pork belly is good.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.260
The stew is good too.

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:46.065
It's thanks to this stew...

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.569
that the pork belly tastes better.

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:55.374
Mmm.

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:57.710
Good job.

00:17:57.777 --> 00:17:59.412
GOOD JOB, BRO

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.352
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THEM
HAS MADE THEIR DINNER MORE SATISFYING

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:07.954
What?

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.423
I'm so full.

00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:12.625
Can you eat more?

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:15.061
Yes. I like gochujang stew.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:20.600
WITH THE STEW MADE BY JIMIN

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.136
We're going to smell pork tonight.

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:27.873
JUNG KOOK CONTINUED
TO ENJOY HIS HAPPY DINNER

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:34.880
AFTER THE HAPY DINNERTIME

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.784
[Jimin] Okay, I see a stopwatch.

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:40.987
-[Jung Kook] A game?
-[director] Yes.

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.489
I did a brief check before coming.

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:45.791
-I see.
-That camera is filming

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.727
a stopwatch set up there.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.196
And they connected our earphones
by Bluetooth.

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:53.499
We might have to listen to something
and guess in a given time.

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.369
MY NAME IS JIMIN, A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:57.903
But it's meaningless to know.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.942
[director] Tomorrow morning,
we're going to

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:06.479
take a train to Zürich.

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.047
Zürich.

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:11.083
[director] Once we get there,
you'll be given

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.486
some free time to relax downtown.

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.588
And to enjoy your free time,

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:18.324
you'll need an allowance
for your expenses.

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:19.859
-Right.
-In that sense,

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.862
we're going to give you 150 francs.

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:24.397
That's a lot.

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.165
TIME TO OBTAIN ALLOWANCE AGAIN

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.933
A MAXIMUM OF 150 FRANCS

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.202
FIRST GAME: 50 FRANCS
SECOND GAME: 100 FRANCS

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.138
All right, then. Again...

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.507
THE GAME BOX IS HERE TOO

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.379
WHAT KIND OF GAME

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:42.348
DO WE HAVE TO PLAY...?

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.749
SLEEP MASKS

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:45.184
-[Jung Kook] Sleep masks?
-Yes.

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:46.686
ROUND 1 OVER 50 FRANCS

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.220
BLIND TASTING

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.856
PRACTICE GAME: DATE

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:54.960
THEIR EYES ARE
TO BE COVERED WITH SLEEP MASKS

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.629
FLOUNDERING

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:57.930
There's nothing here.

00:19:57.997 --> 00:19:59.031
Oh, here it is.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.600
There's one.

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.135
THEY MUST USE THEIR SENSES

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.503
OF TOUCH, SMELL...

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.105
I don't smell anything.

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:09.675
...AND TASTE

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:11.177
It's a date.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.779
TO GUESS WHAT KIND OF FOOD IT IS

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:15.081
[director] The answer is...

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.917
date.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:18.984
ROUND 1
4 QUESTIONS

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.187
THEY'LL BE GIVEN 50 FRANCS
IF THEY GET 3 RIGHT

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.422
JIMIN IS UP FIRST

00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:25.624
-It's hard.
-It is.

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:26.992
[director] It's a go, right?

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.061
-Go!
-All right, bring it over.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.600
I'd like to touch it.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:35.668
Please put it

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:37.903
on my hands.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.740
HE'S READY TO TOUCH IT

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:41.907
COME ON

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:46.846
Oh, gosh.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:48.981
It's a potato chip.

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:50.683
THE FIRST QUESTION IS TOO EASY

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.320
[director] Guess which flavor it is
this time.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.421
Which flavor?

00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:57.490
It's obviously potato chips.

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.824
THE FLAVOR IS IMPORTANT

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:02.695
USING THE SENSE OF SMELL

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.730
AND THE SENSE OF TASTE

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:06.198
TASTING

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:11.203
THIS FLAVOR IS...

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.573
We've had it many times, Jung Kook.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.575
JUNG KOOK TRIES ONE TOO

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:20.379
WHICH FLAVOR WAS IT...

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.548
I have to guess its flavor right?

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:24.683
Is it good?

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:26.619
Oh.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:27.853
HE GETS IT

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.688
What's your guess? One, two, three.

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.290
Honey butter.

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:32.391
Incorrect.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:33.926
What's wrong with your palate?

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:37.696
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.265
Which flavor is it?

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:41.667
It's obviously pepper-flavored.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:43.969
THE ANSWER IS PAPRIKA

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:46.238
You can taste paprika from this?

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.474
It's pepper-like. It is.

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.776
This can't be honey butter.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.781
GO AWAY

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.684
THUMBS UP

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.486
[director speaking indistinctly]

00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:03.989
Wait. I better not mess up
after doing this.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:06.025
IT'S JUNG KOOK'S TURN NOW

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.494
Let's see what your palate can do.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:09.895
-Are you ready?
-Wait.

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:12.298
Can I have a sip of water before I go?

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:13.933
-Water?
-Yes.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.100
Honey butter?

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.770
HERE COMES WATER

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:18.871
Thanks.

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:21.340
RINSING HIS MOUTH WITH WATER
BEFORE TASTING

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:24.777
I SHOULD'VE DONE THE SAME...

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.646
Hey, you should've told me
to drink water first too.

00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:30.683
I said honey butter
because I had that sweet date.

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.685
It wasn't my fault. My palate was precise.

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.055
Saltiness is supposed to taste stronger
after having something sweet.

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.624
I had them together.
Some was left in my mouth.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.760
THE HARMONY OF SWEET AND SALTY
RESULTED IN HONEY BUTTER...

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:43.229
Okay, here comes the food.

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.597
[yells]

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.298
NERVOUS FOR NOTHING

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.933
THE FOOD IS BROUGHT OVER

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:51.470
SNORTING

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:52.538
What is it?

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.574
-Is this it?
-Yes.

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:59.211
SHAKING AND NERVOUS

00:23:00.446 --> 00:23:01.480
FUMBLING

00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:03.716
-It's very long.
-[Jimin chuckling]

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:04.783
It's long.

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.486
I don't like how it looks.

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:12.725
THE SECOND FOOD GOT CRITICIZED
FOR ITS LOOKS...

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.893
What is this?

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:18.364
HE'S JUST HAPPY

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.733
TRYING TO SMELL IT CALMLY

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.268
Isn't it a smoking pipe?

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:25.070
[director] It's okay to taste it,

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:26.839
but don't swallow it.

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:27.940
What?

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.311
First of all, this part feels challenging.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.582
A DANGEROUS PART

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:37.650
I'll try the middle.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.086
CRUNCHY - VERY CRUNCHY - BITING...

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.591
This tastes like ginger.

00:23:45.658 --> 00:23:47.026
This tastes like ginger.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.528
Oh, it's not what I thought?

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.597
SMELLING

00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:52.998
I thought it was leek.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:58.304
TASTING - DISGUSTED

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.371
WHAT IS THIS...

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:03.042
HIS EYES, NOSE AND LIPS
CAN'T HIDE THE TRUTH

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.176
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:05.244
SMELLING

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:06.345
It's ginger.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:08.047
Is it not?

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.115
It smells like it.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.051
No?

00:24:12.151 --> 00:24:14.119
-[groans]
-Don't swallow it?

00:24:14.853 --> 00:24:19.224
ONCE AGAIN CAREFULLY

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.726
SHIVERING

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:24.096
HE TRIES IT AGAIN

00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:25.864
DISGUSTED

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:28.968
HE CAN NEVER GET USED TO THE TASTE

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:31.003
It doesn't look like ginger.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.471
This can't be ginger.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:34.907
It's long, but it's not a mic.
What is this?

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:36.875
HE'S CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT IT IS

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:37.943
We...

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.878
I don't know what it is, either.

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:41.013
I can't help him.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.514
What is this?

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:45.718
I have no idea even with my eyes open.

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:49.088
It seems like a food ingredient
I've never seen,

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.424
touched or smelled it before. A vegetable.

00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:55.961
The way I see it, it's something
that's used instead of ginger.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:57.029
Do you want a hint?

00:24:57.096 --> 00:25:00.632
Yes, I need a hint. I've never seen...
I mean, used this before.

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:02.034
It's five syllables.

00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:05.537
Countries that mainly use
this ingredient...

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.272
-Yes.
-...have warm climates.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.209
I'm sure you've had it before,

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:13.612
but it's an ingredient
in a very famous kind of soup.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:17.149
DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:18.317
Thailand? Which country?

00:25:18.384 --> 00:25:20.552
-It must be tom yum goong.
-The Philippines?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.088
-How am I supposed to know?
-Exactly, my point.

00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:25.491
Five syllables? Can't I get a letter hint?

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.793
[director] I'll tell you the first letter.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.861
L.

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:30.829
-L?
-L.

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:34.767
L... Lemon.

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:35.868
No.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:38.604
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.671
What?

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:41.907
What are you doing?

00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:44.810
That's an original form of it.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:47.746
WHAT ARE YOU DOING...?

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:50.382
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:51.517
What?

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:55.554
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:56.655
What?

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.691
-What are you doing?
-Water's gone.

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.193
WATER!

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.895
LAUGHING

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.296
I WANT SOME WATER

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:05.464
Here you go.

00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:06.965
HERE'S WATER FOR YOU

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:08.033
You kept...

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.102
I thought you were getting the smell out.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.438
"Water's gone." [laughing]

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:17.376
-I really have no idea.
-Just give up.

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:19.912
What is this? I have no idea.

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.713
All right. What is your guess?

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.015
One, two, three.

00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.283
I give up.

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:25.684
[director] Lemongrass.

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.454
THEY ALREADY FAILED TO GUESS TWO RIGHT

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.621
Is it over?

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:31.657
[director] The 50 francs
is out the window.

00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.092
FEELING BAD ABOUT LEMONGRASS

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:37.096
Then if you guess the remaining two right,
we will give you...

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:38.263
-Then, 50.
-Yes, 50.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.199
A CHANGE IN THE RULES

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.266
Bring it over.

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:46.572
THE THIRD QUESTION IS BROUGHT OVER
FOR JIMIN

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:49.241
FUMBLING

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:51.577
Wait. Is it edible?

00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:54.346
Hey, this is...

00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.282
Isn't this a cap or something?

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:01.520
Are you sure it's something to eat?

00:27:02.254 --> 00:27:04.223
YES, IT'S EDIBLE

00:27:06.058 --> 00:27:08.427
Wait, it's melting. It must be chocolate.

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:11.263
RELIEVED TO KNOW IT'S CHOCOLATE

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.364
It's chocolate.

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:17.169
HE HAS TO GUESS ITS NAME RIGHT

00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:18.937
Gosh.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.542
FALLING

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:25.978
HIS EYES OPEN WIDE

00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:29.681
Is it really edible?

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:33.519
ARE YOU SURE...?

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:36.655
Mmm!

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:38.824
CHOKING

00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:40.659
How did they make this?

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:46.098
It's a four-syllable chocolate.

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:47.900
A four-syllable chocolate?

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:52.437
HE'S CURIOUS...

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:54.540
Jung Kook.

00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:59.211
HE GETS IT!

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.782
HE FIGURES IT OUT AND FIDGETS

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.584
IT'S THAT THING!

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:08.987
GIVE HIM THE ANSWER ALREADY!

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:10.689
[all laughing]

00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:12.457
A four-syllable chocolate?

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.327
YES, THAT

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.199
HE TASTES IT AGAIN AND BECOMES EVEN SURER

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.500
I have no idea.

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:22.901
It just tastes like liquor.

00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.736
YES, THAT LIQUOR

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.542
DO YOU GET IT NOW...?

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:32.177
I have no idea.

00:28:32.244 --> 00:28:34.279
Jung Kook, give him just one hint.

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:36.148
-Just one.
-A hint?

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:37.382
What should I give?

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.351
Its liquor bottle...

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:42.354
is rectangular.

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:43.989
A RECTANGULAR BOTTLE...

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.891
-Go right away.
-It's not vodka.

00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.492
One, two, three.

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.562
-Failure.
-What is it?

00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:52.097
Jung Kook, you say the answer.

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.432
Jack Daniel's chocolate.

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:54.600
Correct.

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:55.901
How am I supposed to know?

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.203
Its bottle is always rectangular.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.472
Just this tastes like Jack Daniel's.

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:01.540
Try it.

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:03.542
It's Jack Daniel's for sure.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:05.877
Now, it does.

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:09.114
All right, 50 francs...

00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:11.850
THE 50 FRANCS IS OUT THE WINDOW AGAIN

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:15.287
I should've done it.

00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:19.091
[director] Then, Jung Kook.
If you get this last question right,

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.026
we'll give you the money.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.194
Thank you.

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.163
THEIR LAST HOPE IS READY

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.299
-Go!
-[director] Bring it over, please.

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:28.567
It's a tough one.

00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:30.035
Why do I only get tough ones?

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:32.738
THE LAST QUESTION SHOWS UP

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:48.353
Where is it?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.022
LAUGHING

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.257
Are you holding...

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:56.628
IT'S SO FUN TO TEASE HIM

00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:58.497
HE BEGINS EXPLORING IT

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.299
Is this another chocolate?

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:01.767
It is. They cracked it here.

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.171
HAVING A BITE RIGHT AWAY

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.440
[director] For this one,

00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:12.711
you just need to guess which flavor it is.

00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:13.912
Cacao?

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:17.416
Isn't it just cacao chocolate?
Just black... Wait.

00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:21.553
It's like...

00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:24.189
TASTING IT WITH THE END OF HIS TONGUE

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:26.091
Gosh, I was going to ask for a bite.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.294
Here.

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:35.534
TASTING IT TOGETHER AT ONCE

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.703
It tastes very familiar.

00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:41.506
How am I supposed to guess
which flavor it is?

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.308
It tastes very familiar.

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:44.643
It's delicious.

00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:48.146
I know I've had it before.

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:51.283
But I've never checked the flavor.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.085
CHILI

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:03.762
CHILI

00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:11.303
A LONELY FIGHT TO FIND THE ANSWER

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.671
Come on. How am I...

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:17.609
Swallow as you taste it carefully

00:31:17.676 --> 00:31:19.044
at the end of a bite.

00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:22.047
Can I feel it, then?

00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:23.582
Yes, you can feel it.

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.016
You do because you know.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.085
[director chuckles]

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.656
Now that I know, let me taste it.

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:35.927
-Have a taste and give him a hint.
-Okay.

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:36.995
Got it.

00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:39.030
What is it?

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:40.098
Thank you.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.905
SAVORING

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:50.942
I can take off the sleep mask, right?

00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:52.878
[director] Okay.

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:54.613
Are you sure you can taste it?

00:31:57.516 --> 00:31:59.351
Hold on. I think I know.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:02.587
The purple-colored fruit.

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:05.824
The purple-colored fruit. No?

00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.025
THAT'S NOT IT

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:08.527
-Jung Kook.
-What?

00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:10.962
That's not it.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.464
I heard the answer.

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:14.099
-You did?
-Yes.

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:16.234
It's not fruit?

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:20.705
I often order this flavor of sauce
at hamburger places.

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:23.708
Ketchup?

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.244
KETCHUP CHOCOLATE...?

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:28.680
-Where's the chocolate? Let me.
-I usually...

00:32:29.815 --> 00:32:30.816
It's spicy.

00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:36.321
SPICY...?

00:32:36.388 --> 00:32:37.689
What's your guess?

00:32:37.756 --> 00:32:39.591
Red pepper? Pepper? What is it?

00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:42.394
You're almost there.

00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.462
Don't be tensed up.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.765
Is it spicy?

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:49.267
Don't be nervous. You're almost there.

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.735
Chili?

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.371
-What's your guess?
-Chili?

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:54.439
Correct.

00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:55.674
How can this be chili?

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.409
You've earned 50 francs.

00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:59.344
That's almost for free.

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.412
I know.

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:03.448
THEY BARELY OBTAINED 50 FRANCS

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:06.251
Please move on to the next game.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.286
-[director] Let's move on right away.
-Okay.

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:11.356
The next game is Silent Scream.

00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:13.191
-Oh, Silent Scream.
-[director] Yes.

00:33:13.258 --> 00:33:16.061
[director] Guess five questions right

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:19.130
You can pass one question. Okay?

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:22.033
If you win this game,
you'll get 100 francs.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.437
All right. Play the music.

00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:29.741
MUSIC IS ON

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.815
Can you hear me?

00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:38.016
I can't hear anything.

00:33:39.084 --> 00:33:43.121
WHEN THE MUSIC BEGINS,
I EXIST ALONE WITH THE SONG...

00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:46.625
JIMIN POSSESSED BY J-HOPE

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.727
WHEN THE MUSIC IS OFF...

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:50.061
[director] Jimin.

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:51.263
Jimin.

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:52.497
JIMIN WOULDN'T ANSWER...

00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:53.665
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:55.000
It's starting.

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:58.169

IT'S DIFFICULT FROM THE START

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.042
Hurry up.

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:05.810

Ca... Ca.

00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:20.892
GOING CRAZY

00:34:21.493 --> 00:34:22.894
I have no idea.

00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:24.863
REPEATING THE FIRST SYLLABLE

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:26.798

"Gye." "Bae."

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:31.703

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.039
-Nyon.

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:35.440
-Nyon.

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:36.508
Nyon.

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:38.510
-"Deot."
-Nyon.

00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:41.279
HIS MOUTH IS CONFUSED

00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:43.148
Canyon. Nyon.

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.317
What are you saying?

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:47.419
-Nyon.

00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:58.663
"Chi."

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.265
S.

00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:01.399

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.635

-Pass. I'll just pass this one.

00:35:03.702 --> 00:35:04.836
SECOND: HOPPING TOUR

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:06.972
Hop. Hop.

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:09.240

THRILLED

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:28.426
Ping.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:29.494

Ur.

00:35:33.565 --> 00:35:34.966
-"Hopping tour"?
-Yes.

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:36.334
What's that?

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:37.602
Lagibolala.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:38.870
"Lagibolala"!

00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:40.939
Are you sure?

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:42.307
-"Are you sure?"
-Right.

00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:43.441
-"Are you sure?"
-Right.

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.110
BUT TIME IS OVER

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.245
Gosh, canyon in the beginning.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:50.515
FAIL OR NOT, HE'S JUST EXCITED

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:52.684
-I should've just passed it.
-What?

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:55.120
It was "canyon swing" at first.

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.655
Oh, canyon swing.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.723
The others were all easy.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.091
I know. What a shame.

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:03.128

FRUSTRATED

00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:43.902

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:33.745

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.413
How many hours for a taste?

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.349
-Let's do it for one hour.
-Okay.

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.684
-One hour?
-Yes.

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.619
I'll bring it over.

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.288
HE'S OFF TO GET HIS PHONE

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:46.691
This little thing actually unlocks.

00:38:46.758 --> 00:38:48.393
FASCINATED BY THE TINY LOCK

00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:49.494
Bye.

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:52.263
JUNG KOOK'S PHONE IS LOCKED UP FIRST

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.331
Goodbye.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.066
Okay, one hour.

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:56.701
JIMIN'S PHONE IS ARRESTED TOO...

00:38:56.768 --> 00:38:59.537
BOTH THEIR PHONES ARE CONFINED

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:01.506
Bye. Take care.

00:39:01.573 --> 00:39:04.142
SEE YOU IN AN HOUR...

00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:06.811
I better shower again...
Want to step outside?

00:39:06.878 --> 00:39:08.046
What?

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.113
No.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.951
[director] All right, then.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.987
IT'S TOUGH ALREADY...

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:18.623
-Good job on today's games.
-Good work.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.658
THE ALLOWANCE GOES BEHIND BARS TOO

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.060
If it doesn't unlock,

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.795
-we won't get the money back.
-Right.

00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:26.898
-[Jimin] Good work.
-[Jung Kook singing]

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.200
[Jimin] It ended too late today. Sorry.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:33.504
THE DIGITAL MINIMALISM STARTS

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:38.910
THE TWO SUDDENLY FEEL A VOID

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:40.078
Should we lie down?

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:42.280
I will.

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:48.052
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
1. JUST LIE DOWN

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.921
We might end up falling asleep.

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:56.628
YOU'RE RIGHT

00:39:57.128 --> 00:40:01.299
THE STAFF SOUND LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.035
OPENING HIS EYES

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.371
GETTING UP TOGETHER

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.506
HAVING FUN WITHOUT US?

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:09.574
What's going on?

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:11.109
WE CAN NEVER TOLERATE IT

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:14.545
DASHING TO THE LIVING ROOM

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:19.851
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
2. WATCH VIDEOS WITH THE STAFF

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.355
It's hilarious when he gets scared
and steps back.

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:29.494
I'm not joking. I was dead scared today.

00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:31.696
It wants your autograph.

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:32.897
What's your name?

00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:34.666
What's your name?

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.434
[all laughing]

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.075
It's funny how you're hovering around.

00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:46.444
3. HOVER AROUND FOR NOTHING

00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:49.681
HOVERING AROUND

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.482
Word chain.

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.351
4. A SUDDEN WORD CHAIN GAME

00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:54.819
Swiss.

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:56.187
Sriracha.

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:01.659
Vehicle.

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.594
Brewery.

00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:06.497
Jangjorim.

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.765
Im Kkeokjeong.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.801
Stamina.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.972
DO IT IF YOU CAN
FULL OF CONFIDENCE

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:15.039
Counterattack.

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:16.107
UNEXPECTEDLY INTENSE

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:17.175
Study.

00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:18.710
Farewell.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:19.844
Villa.

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:21.779
-Tension.
-Reversal.

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.114
Electricity.

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:25.183
Putting in someone's shoes.

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.250
Intelligence.

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:27.485
Indeed.

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:28.820
Eyesight.

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:30.555
Weightlifting.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.622
Superpower.

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:32.690
HE'S PERSISTENT

00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:36.027
THE CHAIN OF "RYEOK" DOESN'T END

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:41.699
JUNG KOOK...

00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:43.434
Find what can't end with "ryeok."

00:41:45.136 --> 00:41:46.904
-Ten.
-I can't think of any.

00:41:47.405 --> 00:41:48.840
I better make him run out.

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.341
Weight.

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:51.409
Vitality.

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.412
This is annoying.

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.314
I should've done it.

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:00.318
-Are you giving up?
-No.

00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:02.186
CONFIDENT

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:04.322
LET'S SEE...

00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:05.823
-Did I do weightlifting?
-Yes.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.992
-Weight too.
-Yes.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.828
I did superpower, vitality, and tension.
All those words.

00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:13.197
Well...

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.265
Rage.

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:15.566
Oh!

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.235
The first one I did was stamina.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.302
Right.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:19.871
Organize.

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:23.808
-Emergency.
-Standing army.

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:25.710
Military power.

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:30.281
JUNG KOOK FINALLY COUNTERATTACKS

00:42:30.348 --> 00:42:32.183
A lot of Korean words end with "ryeok."

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.251
Right.

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:35.253
I think we ran out.

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:38.990
CONFIDENT AND PROUD

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.091
It's your turn.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.027
I can hardly think of any.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:45.930
Yeoksam Station!

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:52.503
IT SOUNDS THE SAME BACKWARDS IN KOREAN

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.138
You rather counterattacked me.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.509
IT WASN'T EASY FOR HIM TO SWITCH TURNS...

00:42:58.576 --> 00:42:59.811
Yeoksam Station.

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.746
HE'S THRILLED THE MORE HE THINKS ABOUT IT

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:03.347
Yeoksam Station.

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.418
Yeoksam Station. What a counterattack.

00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:08.653
Well...

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:09.821
HIS FEET SHOW HIS AGONY

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:12.290
[Jimin] He's in a daze
after taking that blow.

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.357
DAZED...

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:22.066
HE'S STARTING TO FEEL SLEEPY

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.069
I'm so sleepy. I could just go to bed,

00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:27.772
but I'm eager to take my phone with me.

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:31.909
THIS MAN IS TRAPPED
IN THE WORD CHAIN OF RYEOK...

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:34.445
Obvious.

00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:36.981
Obvious is a counterattack
of Yeoksam Station.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.184
LOOK AT THIS PUNK!

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:41.385
Fortune-telling.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.421
DEFENDING CALMLY

00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:44.522
Fortune-telling?

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:47.658
NO WAY...?

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:50.561
-You want to end this game with "ryeok"?
-No, nothing left.

00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:52.063
Drunkard.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.364
Exaggeration.

00:43:53.431 --> 00:43:54.599
Iridium.

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:56.701
GAME IS OVER

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.402
There's one more other than that.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.770
Dium-dium.

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.939
CRAZY CHEMISTRY

00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:04.208
FINDING ANOTHER PRANK

00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:07.512
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
5. FILMING

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:12.283
[Jung Kook humming]

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:18.022
DIRECTOR JEON'S FLASHY CAMERA MOVING

00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:20.925
IRRESISTIBLE "KILLIN' IT GIRL"

00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:39.377
HE'S MOVING SWIFTLY
TO CAPTURE JIMIN'S DANCE

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.753
AN ENDING POSE

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:52.423
IT'S ALREADY A MINUTE BEFORE THE END

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:53.824
I'm going to wait here.

00:44:57.228 --> 00:45:02.733
STANDING BY RIGHT BEFORE THE LOCKUP

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:09.106
RUBBING HIS EYES, FEELING SLEEPY

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:13.544
BUT HE'S RESOLUTE

00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:15.780
It feels longer than a minute of exercise.

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.482
A minute of doing cardio.

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:23.187
SPENDING THE LONGEST MINUTE
IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE

00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:25.790
HIS HAND APPROACHES IN ADVANCE

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.061
[alarm ringing]

00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:33.864
IT'S FINALLY OVER

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.199
Where's the key?

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.102
Where's the key?

00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:39.203
It's over.

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:41.539
Digital minimalism.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.208
Success!

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:49.280
JIMIN CAME RUNNING AT THE NEWS

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:58.389
THE DOOR OPENS...

00:45:58.456 --> 00:45:59.757
IMPATIENTLY TAKING HIS PHONE

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:02.360
It really feels like the military.

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:05.129
HE LOOKS MORE RELAXED THAN AN HOUR AGO

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:06.197
It's me.

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:09.233
I talk stupid nonsense sometimes.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.769
That cell phones must be gotten rid of.

00:46:11.836 --> 00:46:13.070
I take it back.

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:22.446
RETURNING HAPPILY WITH THEIR PHONES

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:23.514
Lie down right away.

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:26.751
Lights off.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.455
[speaking indistinctly]

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.228
WORRIED

00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:38.396
I don't know.

00:46:40.031 --> 00:46:41.932
I can't stand the heat.

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:44.969
ADJUSTING THE CURTAINS TO A WINDOW GAP

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:47.638
Let's keep it open.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.775
Is my phone screen too bright?

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:51.842
LOWERING BRIGHTNESS

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:56.280
JIMIN LIES DOWN WITH HIS PHONE TOO

00:46:56.347 --> 00:46:57.415
[Jung Kook] I'm sleepy.

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:06.524
THEY CAN'T GIVE UP ON USING THEIR PHONES
NO MATTER HOW SLEEPY THEY ARE...

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:12.263
WHILE THEY ENJOY THEIR HARD-EARNED FREEDOM

00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:17.268
THE MORNING SUNSHINE
SLOWLY COMES DOWN THE ROOF

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:22.606
THE LAST MORNING IN BRIENZ
IS ESPECIALLY CLEAR

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.477
THE EMERALD LAKE SHIMMERS

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:29.246
THE DUCKS HAVE BEGUN THEIR DAY EARLY

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.715
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:33.651
THESE TWO ARE STILL SOUND ASLEEP

00:47:33.718 --> 00:47:40.524
IN THE SAME POSITION...

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:43.561
A STRANGE SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:47.865
WAKING UP AT THE SAME TIME

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:55.806
SHOULD I SLEEP SOME MORE?

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.911
DEAD ASLEEP CLUELESSLY

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:01.979
[director] Jimin.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.482
Jung Kook.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:06.384
SCRATCHING

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.752
Wake up.

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:08.919
GOING UNDER THE BLANKET

00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:12.490
GO AWAY

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:16.060
We have a train to catch.

00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:17.728
You need to wake up.

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:19.997
What time do we take off?

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:21.899
At 10:10 at the latest.

00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:23.401
CURRENT TIME: 9:40

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:26.570
PRETENDING TO ANSWER
AND CLOSING THEIR EYES AGAIN

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:31.609
THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP
VERSUS THOSE WHO TRY TO WAKE THEM UP

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:34.879
HE FINALLY WAKES UP

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.013
I'm sleepy.

00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:40.518
HALF-ASLEEP

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.952
[crew member] Wake up already.

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:46.390
THE STAFF LEAVES NOW THAT THEY'RE AWAKE

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:50.394
THEY BEGIN PACKING UP RIGHT AWAY

00:48:50.461 --> 00:48:53.197
THESE TWO ARE AWAKE AND NOTHING ELSE

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:54.999
THEY ONLY HAVE 15 MINUTES LEFT

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.801
[director] You really need to wake up.

00:48:57.268 --> 00:49:01.338
JIMIN IS OFF TO WASH UP

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:05.609
JUNG KOOK BRUSHES HIS TEETH
IN THE ROOM FIRST

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.614
NATURALLY DOING IT ON THE BED

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:13.651
BRUSHING

00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:19.824
JUNG KOOK IS OFF TO THE BATHROOM TOO

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.927
THEY ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
WHEN ALL THEY DID IS WASH UP

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:25.262
STARTING TO PACK UP QUICKLY

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:26.330
A WASHING KIT

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.098
PAJAMAS

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:30.134
A T-SHIRT

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:35.372
JUNG KOOK QUICKLY WASHED UP

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.709
GETTING CHANGED FIRST

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:42.279
PUTTING EVERYTHING IN THE BAG

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:44.815
OH, THE SOCKS

00:49:44.882 --> 00:49:48.452
OH, THE PHONE CHARGER

00:49:48.519 --> 00:49:52.156
-Did we take the money too? 150 francs.
-What?

00:49:52.223 --> 00:49:53.224
I don't remember.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.092
I'm sure we packed it.

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:57.795
NOT AGAIN...?

00:49:57.862 --> 00:50:01.332
OH, THE MOUTHWASH

00:50:02.967 --> 00:50:06.237
HE'S DONE PACKING UP FOR REAL NOW...?

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.472
JUNG KOOK IS FINISHING UP

00:50:08.539 --> 00:50:11.008
JIMIN TAKES OFF FIRST

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:12.510
[Jimin] We have seven minutes.

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:13.811
IT'S A LITTLE PAST THE TIME

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:15.212
Jung Kook!

00:50:15.279 --> 00:50:16.280
[Jung Kook] Yes?

00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:20.417
-Hurry downstairs.
-Okay.

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:23.254
OPENING IT FOR THE LAST TIME

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.289
TAKING HIS HAIRBAND

00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:28.325
HE'S DONE FOR REAL

00:50:33.898 --> 00:50:35.966
TODAY'S PLAN
MOVING TO ZÜRICH, FREE TIME,

00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:37.935
DINNER AT THE HOTEL, A NIGHT WALK

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:46.143
BOTH OF THEM ARRIVE WITH THEIR LUGGAGE

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.445
Thank you.

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.948
QUICKLY GETTING IN THE CAR

00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:53.450
LET'S HEAD TO THE STATION NOW

00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:57.054
We're rushed every time we take a train.

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.929
CHECKING HIS LOOKS BELATEDLY

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:08.232
JIMIN IS CHECKING HIS BANGS

00:51:08.299 --> 00:51:10.668
GIVING UP ON FIXING HIS HAIR

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:13.704
[Jung Kook] Is this the station?
Do they sell tickets there?

00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:15.940
They said it'd take five minutes by car,

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:18.776
so the train will probably leave
in two minutes.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.111
Did you hear me?

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.080
What?

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:29.186
My throat is sore,
so please do what you can to hear me.

00:51:31.689 --> 00:51:36.093
GETTING OUT OF THE CAR QUICKLY

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.462
IT'S SLOW AT THE STATION STILL

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:46.003
LET'S MOVE QUICKLY

00:51:48.639 --> 00:51:51.842
Wait. What the...
I woke up and found myself here.

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:53.844
It's so hectic.

00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:55.713
THE TRAIN TO CATCH

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.281
Isn't this it?

00:51:57.348 --> 00:51:58.349
IT'S COMING IN

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.683
Isn't this our train?

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.751
I think so.

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:05.089
QUICKLY GETTING ON

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:10.961
THEY TAKE A SEAT AND CATCH THEIR BREATH

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:12.029
[Jung Kook] It's...

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:13.297
Oh, it's running.

00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:17.334
THEY'RE OFF TO ZÜRICH FROM BRIENZ!

00:52:17.401 --> 00:52:18.402
Bye.

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:20.671
Where do we get off?

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.941
I think we have a long way to go.

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:27.378
THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL TIME IS 12:51 P.M.

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:29.813
What, 12:51 p.m.?

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.682
It takes more than two hours.

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.886
THE SWISS LANDSCAPE WILL ACCOMPANY THEM

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.391
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IN THEIR NEXT DESTINATION...?

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:43.861
JIMIN HAS BROUGHT A DISPOSABLE FILM CAMERA

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:52.403
REFUSING TO TAKE PICTURES

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.340
HE'S SO NOT EASY

00:52:56.407 --> 00:52:58.108
IS HE PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP?

00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.244
NO, HE'S FAKING IT!

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.614
You can't fall asleep like that.

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:08.152
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE...

00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:11.055
Are you asleep?

00:53:15.726 --> 00:53:18.762
ZONING OUT

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:20.364
Should we eat less from today?

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.299
If possible.

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:25.936
HOLDING HIS LAUGHTER

00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:27.438
Why are you smirking?

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.309
FINDING FOOD RIGHT AWAY

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:33.410
What's that?

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.979
[crew member] Injeolmi chips.

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.147
Sounds good.

00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:39.783
NOPE!

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:42.319
Oh, it's a peanut-flavored one.

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.422
You suggested we eat less one minute ago.

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:46.724
[Jung Kook] It's not sweet.

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:48.726
It's not sweet.

00:53:51.128 --> 00:53:52.629
This is addicting.

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:55.899
HE'S IMPOSSIBLE

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.770
THE LANDSCAPE IN SWITZERLAND FROM A TRAIN

00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.744
IT'S NOT BORING FOR A SECOND

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.879
EVERY MOMENT IS BEAUTIFUL

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:11.815
[director] Let's get off.
We have to transfer.

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:19.056
LET'S GO TRANSFER

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:26.630
It's not heavy.

00:54:27.131 --> 00:54:30.400
We have to spend a lot of time
on a train today.

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:33.337
STRUGGLING

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:34.404
It's heavy.

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:37.508
THEIR TRANSFER TRAIN

00:54:41.512 --> 00:54:43.881
SAFELY ON BOARD

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.750
IT'S A TWO-STORY TRAIN THIS TIME

00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:48.786
What on earth?

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:51.989
JUNG KOOK IS EXCITED TO BE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.425
LET'S TAKE OFF AGAIN TO ZÜRICH

00:54:56.493 --> 00:55:01.932
THE CLOSER THEY GET,
THE MORE EXCITED THEY FEEL...

00:55:01.999 --> 00:55:03.000
JIMIN FELL ASLEEP

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:06.270
[director] When we arrive in Zürich,

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:09.907
you can pick a restaurant you want.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.376
DIY TRAVEL IS THEIR FIRST PLAN

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:15.579
Have lunch and stuff.

00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.915
Remember the pass you have?

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:18.982
Yes.

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:23.887
THE SWISS TRAVEL PASS GIVES YOU
AN UNLIMITED ACCESS

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:28.559
TO VARIOUS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONS
LIKE TRAINS, BUSES, FERRIES AND TRAMS

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.327
It's an all-around pass.

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:35.933
AS THEY ENJOY THE CHANGES
IN THE LANDSCAPE,

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.768
THEY ARRIVE AT THE ZÜRICH STATION

00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:39.269
[Jung Kook] Do we get off here?

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.338
Jimin, we have to get off.

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:45.876
GETTING OFF IN A RUSH

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.656
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:03.126
Do we have free time from now?

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.194
THE FREE TIME BEGINS

00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:05.562
Jimin.

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.800
It's most crowded here.

00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:11.802
-What?
-It's most crowded.

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:13.937
ZÜRICH

00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:16.340
THE BIGGEST CITY IN SWITZERLAND

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.408
ITS CHARM IS A RICH AND CHEERFUL VIBE

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.878
IT'S THE CENTER
OF SWISS ECONOMY AND CULTURE

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.614
It's different here for sure.

00:56:24.648 --> 00:56:26.750
It doesn't feel nature-integrated.

00:56:26.817 --> 00:56:27.951
Right.

00:56:28.018 --> 00:56:30.687
It has a typical European vibe.

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.789
-It's civilized.
-[Jimin] Right.

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:36.293
Jung Kook.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.628
Why don't we go there?

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.162
-What?
-Let's cross the street.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.764
-There?
-Yes.

00:56:40.831 --> 00:56:42.132
What's there?

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:44.501
-That side is the main street.
-We should stop.

00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:45.736
The signal changed.

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.204
Let's stay in the shade.

00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:49.406
Let's hide in the shade. It's too hot.

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:53.477
TAKING SHELTER IN THE SHADE FOR A WHILE

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:58.081
THEY'RE PROVIDED A LUGGAGE-KEEPING SERVICE
TO ENJOY TRAVELING AT EASE

00:56:58.949 --> 00:56:59.950
-Let's go.
-There.

00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:06.023
Our necks will get tanned.

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:09.159
I need to apply sunblock on my neck.

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.230
I think we're going to a bigger crowd.

00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:14.564
STEPPING INTO A CROWD

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.233
Let's avoid a crowd.

00:57:18.302 --> 00:57:19.303
Let's take a tram.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:26.043
TAKING A TRAM TO AVOID A CROWD

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.978
USING THEIR TRAVEL PASSES TO GET ON

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:29.413
[Jung Kook] You can sit first.

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.148
-Are we going anywhere?
-No idea.

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.215
Let's escape first.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.550
THEY GOT ON FIRST...

00:57:34.318 --> 00:57:35.552
We have no plans, right?

00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:38.088
I have no idea about where we're going.

00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:40.090
We just wanted to escape.

00:57:40.157 --> 00:57:43.560
Let's go where you want today.

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.330
Will you be okay?

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:51.368
I'M NOT SO SURE...

00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:52.869
[Jung Kook] We have to get off.

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:56.039
ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY...?

00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:57.741
SEARCHING FOR A RESTAURANT

00:57:57.808 --> 00:57:59.676
I don't know what we should eat.

00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:02.713
You're not hungry, right?

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.081
I'm not.

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:08.785
We find it harder to spend free time.

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.557
I BETTER STEP IN...

00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:16.793
Oh, we haven't tried the veal.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.095
There's a place.

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.365
But prices are really expensive here.

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.234
Why don't we have one expensive meal?

00:58:24.301 --> 00:58:26.069
-That's a good idea.
-It's not bad.

00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:30.907
SEARCHING HARD

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.678
-Within a one-minute walk from here...
-Yes.

00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:38.448
JIMIN HAS FOUND A GOOD RESTAURANT
WITHIN A ONE-MINUTE DISTANCE

00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:40.117
There's a popular restaurant.

00:58:41.118 --> 00:58:42.786
Let's go there.

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:45.355
But we should go
where you want to go today.

00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:46.423
That's the place.

00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:53.830
LET'S GO EAT

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.265
Let's drink an afternoon beer.

00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:58.368
We have enough money too.

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:01.004
-I know. We can enjoy some luxury today.
-But this is...

00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:03.874
This place is known for expensive dishes.

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:07.144
Still, I can't believe
it's a one-minute distance.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.912
I searched and there was one.

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:10.480
How did you find it?

00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:15.085
I searched on YouTube, Naver and Google.

00:59:15.152 --> 00:59:16.153
Here it is.

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.521
THEY DID ARRIVE IN A MINUTE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:19.723
PROUD

00:59:20.524 --> 00:59:22.159
[Jimin] Should we just sit here?

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.028
TAKING AN OUTDOOR TABLE

00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:26.763
They've brought us the menu.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.065
This must be it.

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.633
CAREFULLY READING THROUGH

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.735
Is their specialty sausages?

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:32.803
I think so.

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.571
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:36.673
This is for two people.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.243
Let's order this 400 gram veal dish.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.311
This?

00:59:41.378 --> 00:59:43.780
-I think it's deep-fried.
-Oh.

00:59:43.847 --> 00:59:49.352
And the amount is this much
with a side of this much potato.

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.720
Let's share it.

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:52.022
-Are you not hungry?
-No.

00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:54.357
Why don't we order this one and beer?

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.559
Sounds good.

00:59:56.193 --> 00:59:57.194
WE'D LIKE TO ORDER

00:59:57.828 --> 00:59:59.329
[waitress in English] Yes please.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.999
-[in English] This one.
-Yes.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.901
[in English] And draft beer two, please.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.270
-Two beer? Draft beer?
-Two beer.

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.673
-Okay. Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.274
[in Korean] That was neat.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.677
We've ordered
too many kinds of dishes before.

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.378
This is what it should be like.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:19.950
Now, we're spending about 100 francs
for just this meal.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:25.088
But I think it's a good idea
to have something delicious.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:30.861
I'm surprised you searched
and found this place right away.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:33.997
As if we were meant to come here.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:35.065
Destiny.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.367
It's served right away.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.469
-[in English] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:41.538
BEER IS SERVED FIRST

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.340
Let's do a toast while we're at it.

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.175
[in Korean] Sure. Today...

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:54.885
REFRESHED

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.388
Let me search a little about Zürich.

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.094
AT THE AGE TO PLAY WITH CAMERAS

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.629
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.203
-I've searched a few places.
-Okay.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:17.541
This city is famous
for its art galleries and museums.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:22.212
There's a place you can learn
about the Swiss history and stuff.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.482
There's also a place you can enjoy
natural landscapes.

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:27.684
There's a park.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:32.422
And there is
a Michelin two-star restaurant here.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:35.192
They say it's nice for dinner.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.127
Would it be expensive?

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.763
We should make a deal
to use a credit card.

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.331
I mean, if we're going there.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:42.766
Anyway, that's one.

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.936
And this city is famous for hash browns.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.305
It's called rösti.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.340
With cheese and potatoes...

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:51.775
It's like a potato dish.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:54.811
THIS IS RÖSTI

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.681
It looks like potato
and this is a typical breakfast here.

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.950
SOMETHING BIG HAS ARRIVED

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.017
[Jimin] What's this?

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.085
Wow.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.589
THE MEAT SURROUNDS A LONG SWORD

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.491
IT LOOKS SO JUICY

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.427
[Jimin] I can't believe what I ordered.

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:11.695
IT'S SO BIG

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.129
This is an actual sword.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.866
HE CAN'T PASS ON IT

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.268
Let me have a taste.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.637
-Want a photo?
-No.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.506
THE OTHER DISHES ARE SERVED AS WELL

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.509
[in English] Thank you.

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.411
Oh, this. It's served right away.

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.747
-Jung Kook.
-[in Korean] Yes?

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:32.916
We get to try the potato pancake
I mentioned.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:34.317
-It came out right away.
-Yes.

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.586
Let me try the potato first.

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:46.429
It just tastes like hash brown.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.799
JIMIN TRIES THE VEAL FIRST

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:52.435
Come to think of it,
there are lots of potatoes here.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.537
EXCLAIMING

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:58.808
JUNG KOOK TRIES THE VEAL TOO

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:03.213
METICULOUSLY WITH SOME SAUCE

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:06.650
It's delicious.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.619
We're spending up our money right away.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.690
THE TASTE IS WORTH IT

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:16.126
THIS IS DELICIOUS TOO

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.360
It's good.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:22.432
THIS ONE IS GOOD TOO

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.470
THEY KEEP SAYING IT'S GOOD

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:33.109
DIGGING IN

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:35.812
IT'S SUCH A SATISFYING MEAL

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.915
We shouldn't have it all.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.884
But we finished it.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.419
CLEAN

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.355
THE BEAUTIFUL MEAL IS OVER

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:46.456
I enjoyed it.

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:49.793
I wonder how much it is.

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:53.229
One hundred one and sixty.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.034
I don't have it.

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:01.237
The wallet is in my luggage.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.605
-Really?
-Yes.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.875
Then we can't spend the money in it.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:10.480
THE BILL IS SETTLED

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.048
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:13.350
[Jimin in Korean] Let's go.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:17.320
NOW THAT WE'RE STUFFED,
LET'S HEAD TO THE HOTEL

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:21.224
GETTING IN THE CAR TO GO TO THE HOTEL

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.260
[in Korean] We're finally somewhere cool.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.762
We're finally off to the hotel.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:27.697
Finally, the hotel.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.332
Finally, the hotel.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:34.003
We've had beer so we can't drive.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.805
So the director is...

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.474
Driving for us!

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.409
Is it about a 10-minute distance?

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.411
No, 30 minutes.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:42.812
CHECKING THE GPS NAVIGATOR

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.382
It takes 11 minutes.
It's just in the middle.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.151
THE CAMERA FALLS TO MARK THE TAKEOFF

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.321
HE SUCCESSFULLY SAVED THE CAMERA

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.727
INSTALLING A CAMERA
FOR THE BACKSEAT HIMSELF

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:01.931
THEY'RE OFF TO THEIR HOTEL IN ZÜRICH,
THEIR LAST TRAVEL SPOT

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.601
FILMING JUNG KOOK

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:05.668
I'm filming myself.

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:07.637
I installed one here.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:09.873
I just want to film you from here.

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:13.343
How did I come up
with this brilliant idea?

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.744
I hung it at the back.

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:18.248
Gosh, you don't know enough.

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:20.517
-What?
-That way,

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:25.989
the staff will have to flip the screen
horizontally and stuff.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.657
That's easy.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:29.692
-It's easy to say.
-Have you ever done it?

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.428
-What?
-Have you ever edited videos?

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.129
Have you?

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:34.597
I have.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:35.665
Right.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.768
Which country are we going tomorrow again?

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.570
POKER FACE

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.238
THAT'S MY BOY

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:44.507
[director] But I haven't told you yet.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.744
HE DIDN'T FALL FOR IT

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.913
I hear we're going to a fine hotel.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.014
[Jung Kook exclaims]

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.216
A five-star hotel.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.051
Can you tell us which hotel it is?

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.254
[director] The Dolder?
Something like that.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.355
What?

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.958
I think I saw it online earlier.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.228
Isn't it the place
with a famous restaurant?

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.664
[director] Its restaurant is famous.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.098
-Right?
-Yes.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.367
I told Jung Kook about it earlier.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.303
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:16.039
Everything is going as I say today.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.474
Why?

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.977
I told you
about this famous dinner place, right?

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.446
That's where we're staying today.

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.514
Seriously?

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.016
-Yes.
-That's crazy.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.084
I know.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.986
The scenery there is legendary enough

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:33.556
for us to stay there
without going anywhere else.

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:34.724
Hmm.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.359
Our hotel?

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.328
[Jimin] It looks like a castle.

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:39.762
Like a Disneyland castle.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.997
Oh.

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.833
It's awesome in winter.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.368
I know. I really...

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.704
HOW THE HOTEL LOOKS IN WINTER

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.907
This is how the hotel looks in winter.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:52.909
It's like that one from Frozen.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.210
I can't wait.

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:55.979
It's beautiful. It's so pretty.

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.248
I really want to see
what it's like in winter.

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:01.084
Winter in Zermatt might be legendary.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.185
I do want to see it.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.822
But I'd like to visit Zürich again too.

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.326
HOW WOULD SWITZERLAND LOOK
COVERED IN SNOW...?

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.963
TELLING THEMSELVES
TO VISIT AGAIN IN WINTER SOMEDAY,

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:16.332
THEY HEAD TO THE LAST HOTEL

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.667
[Jimin] We're almost there.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:18.968
I can't wait.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.508
AS HE SINGS

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.477
This is...

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.980
Wow, I think I saw a picture of this view.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.348
[Jung Kook] What on earth?

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.483
What is this place?

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.751
THE DOLDER HOTEL IN ZÜRICH

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:35.985
[Jimin] Shall we get out?

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.054
[Jung Kook] We should. We've got to.

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:42.759
This is one
of the most famous hotels in Zürich.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.396
When I looked it up, it was said

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.167
to be famous for its restaurant and views.
It sure has an amazing view.

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.470
Awesome.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.607
AN OPEN PANORAMA VIEW

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:02.045
This really is legendary.

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:05.114
Hold on. Let me take some pictures.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:11.654
If I bring my parents here,
they're going to love it.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:16.159
TAKING PICTURES OF THE VIEW

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.931
-Should we go in?
-Let's go in. It's hot.

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:24.067
LET'S GO CHECK OUT THE INSIDE

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.769
ENTERING

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.504
Where do we go? Do we go up?

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.710
I just want to hurry in and lie down.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.912
YOU ENJOY LYING DOWN IN BED AT HIS AGE

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:43.019
If a place like this
is owned by an individual...

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.224
QUICKLY HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE ROOM

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.559
Finally, a hotel room.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:59.869
SLOW

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:01.738
TAKING HIS TIME

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:02.805
It's grand.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.377
This hotel itself is beautiful.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.445
The pathways are fresh.

01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:13.583
It's not like those typical hotels.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:17.787
Jung Kook has disappeared.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:22.759
HE'S ALREADY IN FRONT OF THE ELEVATORS

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.560
SIGHING

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:26.396
What can I do? I should wait.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.731
HURRY UP

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.735
RUSHING JIMIN TO HURRY

01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:35.071
-He's too fast for me.
-He's so slow.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:37.440
-I'd like to keep my pace.
-So slow.

01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:38.574
How frustrating.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:45.915
SAME PLACE, DIFFERENT SPEED

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.553
JIMIN GETS TO THE ELEVATORS TOO

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.422
All right, let's get on.

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:56.359
-Which floor is it?
-Sixth.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:57.860
I can finally get some rest.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.862
Wait.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.933
Honestly, we can sleep
just with a blanket on the floor.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.602
I can even sleep here. I have experience.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.504
Right. Like your name, Jeon Jung Kook.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.872
I know.

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.874
That's for sure.

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.243
Isn't it "Jeonjeok," though?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.079
My name isn't Jeon Jeok Kook.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.382
Hello, I'm Jeok Kook.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.250
That means "enemy country" in Korean.

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:24.420
FORTUNATELY, THEY ARRIVE
BEFORE HE BECOMES AN ENEMY COUNTRY

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:26.789
Gosh.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:30.426
All right, up to here.
Let's check the bathroom.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.361
Hold on. It's connected to where?

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.564
LET'S LOOK AROUND THE HOTEL ROOM

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.033
The bathroom is here. It's nice.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.435
Hold on. Let me show here too.

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:43.473
A ROOM TOUR WITH JIMIN

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:47.443
[Jimin exclaims]

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:52.115
A VERANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL OPEN VIEW

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:56.052
Okay.

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.989
I will share a hotel bed with Jimin again.

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.557
SO EXCITED

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:07.897
Is it following me? It is.

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.532
Bugs come in here too.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:12.502
A FLY CHECKED IN THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:14.170
Dang.

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:16.572
Did it follow us from Interlaken?

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:17.673
[Jung Kook] Did it?

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:25.782
PEACE HAS COME AFTER THE ROOM TOUR

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.051
We're staying here just for one night.

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:31.154
What a shame.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:37.527
IT'S SHORT,
BUT THEY FULLY ENJOY THE PEACE

01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:42.865
HE ENDS UP DIVING ONTO THE BED

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:48.204
JUNG KOOK HAS ACHIEVED ALL HE WANTED...

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:53.643
RESTING THEIR OWN WAYS

01:11:55.945 --> 01:12:00.316
THE LAST AFTERNOON IN SWITZERLAND
IS PASSING

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.686
THE BREAK IS OVER
AND THEY'RE OFF TO HAVE DINNER

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:10.760
US ON THE LAST DAY IN SWITZERLAND

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.163
I hear he's coming
to the States on July 9.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.200
That's three days after we arrive.

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.001
Then, can we eat for three days?

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:25.141
I'm going to have In-N-Out for sure.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.309
Let's go, then.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.477
I can never give it up.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.745
We can order some in.

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:35.251
We're flying to the States on July 6

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:38.888
and have a song camp
to start producing our music.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.959
We'll go make some awesome songs.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.527
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RESTAURANT

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:45.862
Cameras off for a while.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.763
SINCE IT'S CROWDED INSIDE

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.133
[Jung Kook] Hello.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.102
MOVING TO THE TABLE

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:54.770
SEATED

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:57.540
LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.508
I better turn the flash on.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:02.879
A GORGEOUS POSE

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.280
One, two.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:06.849
THE EPITOME OF A STYLISH PICTURE

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:09.352
IT'S JIMIN'S TURN

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:10.419
UNNATURAL AND AWKWARD

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.754
All right, one.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.023
NOW, IT'S A LUXURY EVEN TO COUNT TO TWO

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.025
You should've take it at "all right."

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:18.461
ONE IS ENOUGH
IT'S GOOD HOWEVER IT'S TAKEN

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.963
GOING THROUGH THE MENU

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.865
-Let's...
-How about a signature dish?

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:24.367
I was thinking the same.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.002
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.738
But I don't understand
what's written here.

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:30.907
They also have dishes for sharing.

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:31.974
[Jimin] Hmm.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.710
Soups for starters here.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:35.845
And here...

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:37.947
Do we need appetizers?

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.282
No.

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.717
I'd like a salad, though.

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:44.186
Then how about an avocado salad?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.922
-Good.
-And truffle fries.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.290
Nice.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.692
This is a tomahawk steak,

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:53.562
dry-aged for 28 days.

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:54.897
I've wanted to try it.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.400
I've never had a dry-aged steak before.

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:59.502
Should we try it? I want to try it too.

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.771
I kind of want fish too.

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.272
I haven't had it in so long.

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:05.875
How about these two? Is it too much?

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.109
I think so.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:09.712
DEEPLY TORN

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:13.049
-What do you want to ask?
-How many servings are these?

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.717
That I can't ask in English.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.419
It's hard already from the start.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.521
JUNK KOOK MUSTERS UP HIS COURAGE

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:19.789
When he's walking away.

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.057
ASKING TO NO ONE

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.692
LAUGHING

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.760
SIR

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.028
[in English] Excuse me.

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.697
[in Korean] He's not listening.

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.565
I was going to ask.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.967
I think it's for two.

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.468
THE SERVERS ARE BUSY

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.204
Let's order two share dishes and...

01:14:35.271 --> 01:14:36.339
One side dish,

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.541
-and wine.
-Let's order some wine too.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.076
Good. Jung Kook, make an order.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:41.911
Well...

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:44.180
ANYONE READY TO TAKE OUR ORDER?

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:45.247
"Well..."

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.050
Sir.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.285
HE TIMIDLY CALLS HIM

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.654
A POLITE SMILE

01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:53.789
Do you have any questions?

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:54.957
No questions.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:56.759
[in English] This one. This. This one.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:59.695
HE'S ADORABLE

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:01.397
Side dishes.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.000
This one.

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.568
One truffle fries?

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:06.669
-Yes.
-Truffle fries?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.538
-Cool. Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.040
UNBURDENED

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:12.408
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:13.476
Wine.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:16.145
HIS EYES SHAKE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.547
Wine.

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:21.617
-Great. Of course.
-Would you like to recommend...

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.752
Oh!

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:27.456
HE SILENTLY POINTS
AT SOMETHING ON THE MENU

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.891
[in English] This one, please.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.292
Let me note this one.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.764
I'd go for the white, then,
for the fish, actually.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.032
TO PAIR WITH THE FISH,

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.701
THEY ORDER TWO GLASSES OF WINE
AND OTHER DISHES

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.403
-Wonderful.
-Wonderful.

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.238
IT WAS A WONDERFUL ORDERING TIME

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:44.006
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:45.474
-May I?
-Thank you.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.209
-Thank you.
-You're a gentleman.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:50.146
-[in Korean] Anyway, he's quite cool.
-[in Korean] I know.

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:54.250
THEY FINALLY GET TO ENJOY THE VIEW

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:57.286
[Jung Kook] We came out
just when it's nice and cool. I love it.

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.223
It's our last evening in Switzerland.

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.727
So we came
to the most expensive and finest place.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.596
I personally...

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:11.700
liked Zermatt the most.

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:13.636
It's nice here too.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:17.373
HOW THEY WAIT FOR THEIR FOOD

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.143
WAIT, THIS BEAT IS...

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:24.547
THEY CAN'T PASS ON "KILLIN' IT GIRL"

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:29.118
AFTER A PERFORMANCE,

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.755
THE WINE IS SERVED

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.157
White wine.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:36.692
Let me pour you some.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.094
Okay.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.228
Thank you.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.335
-Thank you.
-Sure.

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:47.970
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:54.143
This is a way to give wine
some quick aeration.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:56.579
-You create a tornado inside?
-Yes.

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:57.847
It's so fast.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.249
This allows the wine
to make more contact with air.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:01.350
Air contact?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.551
Right...

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.688
-You're good.
-Of course.

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:08.624
I know when to do it. How much contact...

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:13.095
How much contact...

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:15.297
BE EASY ON THE WINE...

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:18.567
How much contact with air...

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.705
[Jimin laughing]

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:26.408
TOTALLY SATISFIED

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.479
My wine must taste differently from yours.

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:31.680
Try mine after yours.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:35.784
A SIP OF THE SLIGHTLY AERATED WINE FIRST

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.486
CONFIDENT

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:38.787
This must be more fragrant.

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.924
TASTING THE MORE AERATED WINE

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:44.493
-Right?
-I think it is.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.628
-Right?
-Yes.

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:46.729
SWIRL IT, THEN

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:47.796
I think it really is.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.867
SUPER FOCUSED

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:54.270
Let's keep doing it
until the meat is served.

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.406
Do they bring it from there?

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:01.377
WHERE?

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.212
GETTING READY TO TEASE HIM

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:07.283
ALL EXCITED

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:13.322
DUMBFOUNDED...

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:14.390
Wait.

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:20.095
ONE WANTS TO PULL A TRICK
WHILE THE OTHER TRIES NOT TO FALL FOR IT

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:27.336
A PERSISTENT FIGHT
BETWEEN A SPEAR AND A SHIELD

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:28.404
Jung Kook.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.639
What? What is it?

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.707
Goodness.

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:36.111
OH, WELL...

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.583
THAT WAS FUN

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:41.884
-Jung Kook.
-What?

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.052
Can I ask a question?

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:45.154
-No. You too.
-Good day.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:49.692
Let's ask before asking something.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:52.027
-Okay, let's be polite.
-Yeah.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:55.931
-That side is the west?
-Is it a question?

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.700
HE'S SO QUICK TO ADOPT IT

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.401
No, I was talking to myself.

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.738
If it were a question,
I'd have asked for permission first.

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:04.640
-Jimin.
-Yes?

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:06.342
May I ask you something?

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.510
-No.
-All right.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.312
Okay.

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:12.348
-Jimin.
-What?

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.116
Shall we toast?

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:16.118
Ask for permission to ask first.

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:17.586
-Jimin.
-Yes?

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:19.555
-May I ask for a favor?
-Of course.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:20.623
Do me a toast.

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.258
-Sure.
-Good.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:26.495
THEY BARELY MANAGE TO HAVE A TOAST

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:30.332
It's good.

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:31.900
BECAUSE IT TOOK THEM A LOT

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.102
It's become sweeter.

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:35.170
Wait. I see it.

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.238
FINALLY?

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:39.141
10 SECONDS BEFORE THEY MEET THE FOOD

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:40.709
[Jimin singing]

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.212
THE FOOD IS HERE

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.214
-What is it? I can't wait.
-It smells nice.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.049
[sniffing]

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.183
The tomahawk steak?

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.452
THE FIRST DISH IS REVEALED

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.721
THE SALT-GRILLED ATLANTIC SEABASS
CHOSEN BY JIMIN

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:53.822
Oh, he's cracking it.

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:57.393
HAMMERING THE SALT CRUST COVERING THE FISH

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.460
[Jimin] What is it?

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:01.130
It smells so good.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:03.932
IT FINALLY IS REVEALED

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:06.168
IT MAKES THEM STAND UP

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:07.236
This is...

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:09.438
[both exclaiming]

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.006
How did they cook it?

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:12.608
What's this on the outside?

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.276
It smells a bit sweet.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:15.844
[Jimin] Gosh, I love the smell.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.881
AFTER THE SALT CRUST WAS TAKEN OFF,
THE FISH IS REVEALED

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.516
I can't wait.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:23.018
I want to have
the white wine with it so badly.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:24.353
Perfect.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.921
HIS MOUTH WATERS

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:30.859
ROLLING THE SKIN TO REMOVE IT

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.262
-I wanted to have fish.
-Right.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.998
[Jung Kook] I can tell it's tender
just by looking at it.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.300
It will melt in my mouth.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:39.802
The steak is here too.

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:41.503
[Jung Kook laughs]

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.407
THEY'RE STRUCK SPEECHLESS
AT THE SIGHT OF IT...

01:20:45.474 --> 01:20:48.010
[Jimin] This is incredible.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.611
[both exclaiming]

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:54.717
THE OCEAN AND LAND ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER
IN SWITZERLAND

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:57.419
How appetizing.

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:08.197
THE SERVER STARTS TO DELIVER THE FOOD
TO THE TABLE

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:13.969
THE SEABASS AND STEAK ARE ALL SERVED

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.841
THE ENDLESS BLESSING OF FOOD
LIES ON THE TABLE

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:21.310
-The plate is hot.
-[Jimin singing]

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.511
It looks delicious.

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:27.082
THE BEST DINNER TO PUT A FABULOUS END
TO THEIR TRIP IN SWITZERLAND

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:30.185
TRYING THE GRILLED SEABASS FIRST

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.320
[in English] Thank you.

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:35.157
Let me check if there are any bones.

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:37.960
[in Korean] Wait. It tastes familiar.

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.596
Where have I had this taste?

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.998
IT HAS A FAMILIAR TASTE...?

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.566
It's like having

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:48.871
a very soft grilled mackerel
cooked by my mom.

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:51.874
It's actually not easy
to cook something to be soft.

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:56.645
IT'S SO SOFT THAT IT MELTS IN THEIR MOUTHS

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:58.914
I've craved this.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.183
A BITE OF BIG FRENCH FRIES

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.285
DELICIOUS

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.821
JIMIN TAKES A BITE TOO

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:08.390
GLANCING

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.459
Should we share the meat with the staff?

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:13.462
THESE SWEET GUYS CARE
OF THE HARDWORKING STAFF

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:14.730
Should we put some here?

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:20.769
FILLING THE PLATE FOR THE STAFF

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:23.372
HOW GENEROUS...

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.540
Just this much?

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:31.346
EVEN ASPARAGUS FOR NUTRITIONAL BALANCE

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:35.751
A PLATE FULL OF THEIR CARING HEART

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:36.952
I'll go give it to them.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:39.421
JIMIN IS OFF TO DELIVER IT

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:40.489
Hello.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.760
I brought some for you to have a taste.

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:48.063
ENJOY

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.332
GOING BACK TO EATING HEARTWARMINGLY

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:53.635
I've never had a dry-aged steak before.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:54.703
Let me try it now.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.973
JIMIN'S FIRST DRY-AGED STEAK

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:06.048
IT MAKES HIM GO FOR ANOTHER BITE
RIGHT AWAY

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:09.751
JUNG KOOK HAS IT WITH SOME SAUCE

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.186
YUM

01:23:11.253 --> 01:23:13.655
A PIECE OF ASPARAGUS TOO

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:16.425
IT CALLS FOR A SHOULDER DANCE...

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:17.726
Can I have some bok choy?

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:24.900
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO HAVE VEGGIES

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:30.005
IT'S SUCH A FANTASTIC DINNER

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:32.941
JIMIN IS APPLYING SOME SAUCE ON THE MEAT

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.477
YUM

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.613
LOVING IT

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:39.781
Our white wine is here.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:44.720
EXCITED AT THE THOUGHT
OF HAVING IT WITH THE SEABASS

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.457
We can finally enjoy the fish for real.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:49.591
[in English] Thank you.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:52.094
[in Korean] Let's have this
and then the white wine.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.862
Pour some of this.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.866
A MOUTHFUL OF THE GRILLED SEABASS FIRST

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.903
THEN THE WHITE WINE

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.971
CHEERS WITH WHITE WINE

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:09.444
SAVORING

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:14.650
Indeed. White wine
certainly goes well with fish.

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:16.685
The fish is really good.

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:23.692
THIS COMBINATION MAKES THEM EAT NONSTOP

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:27.930
This fish is somewhat addicting.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:32.935
It tastes kind of familiar.

01:24:33.936 --> 01:24:35.470
It's so soft.

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:37.506
IN LOVE WITH THE SEABASS AND WHITE WINE

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:41.977
Mmm!

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:45.213
Mmm!

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:51.520
RINSING THEIR MOUTHS WITH THE WHITE WINE

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.457
It's nice.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.027
A grilled vegetable at the end.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.096
THE LAST MOUTHFUL OF VEGETABLES

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:02.764
HE'S DONE EATING

01:25:04.066 --> 01:25:05.701
-I'm full.
-Me too.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.102
I enjoyed it.

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:13.809
-It was good.
-It was good.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.310
I want to lie down now.

01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:16.378
Let's go do that.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:17.579
Let's do that for a bit.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:19.414
Can we lie down for about 20 minutes?

01:25:19.982 --> 01:25:23.285
THEY'RE OFF TO REST A BIT

01:25:23.352 --> 01:25:25.821
My stomach is about to explode.

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:28.457
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:29.591
I'm so full.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:30.659
Me too.

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:32.894
-I'm extremely full.
-I loved it.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.198
I was craving fish.

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.299
How grateful.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:39.201
We hadn't had fish here, right?

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.268
-No.
-Right?

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:44.539
And we ended up having
a very expensive one.

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:47.309
Let's go in like a scene from a movie.

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:49.378
-Let me film it.
-From below.

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:54.349
Like this.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.418
DIRECTED, FILMED AND PERFORMED

[Jimin laughs]

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:03.792
THE GENRE TURNS OUT TO BE COMEDY...

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.161
I have no room key.

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:09.531
HANDING THE CAMERA HE LEFT BEHIND

01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:11.166
I remembered the key was with me.

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:15.671
IS HE A SHADOW?

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.205
TURNING

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:19.207
TURNING AS WELL

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.911
THE SHADOW CLOSES THE DOOR

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:25.280
I AM

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:26.648

-It was very nice.
-It was nice.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:30.952
See you.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:33.155
LET US TAKE A BREAK

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.023
[director] Let's go.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.259
-[Jung Kook] Must we go?
-Yes.

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:38.393
AFTER A SHORT BREAK

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:43.632
THEY GET IN THE CAR AGAIN TO GO SOMEWHERE

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.133
Should I move the seat for you?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.201
Yes, please.

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:49.638
Not enough space, right?

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:50.772
No.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:54.876
[in English] Is it okay?

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.678
Good.

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:01.183
THEY'VE REGAINED ENERGY AFTER THE BREAK

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:03.118
[both singing]

01:27:03.185 --> 01:27:08.557
OFF TO ENJOY THE LAST NIGHT IN SWITZERLAND

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:15.897
DRIVING DOWN A DARKENING ROAD IN ZÜRICH

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:19.034
[in Korean] The night view
must be beautiful.

01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:20.435
I'm getting the feeling.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.740
I think we can take
a lot of pretty pictures.

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.742
♪ Pretty pictures ♪

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:28.343
It's so pretty here.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.146
ZÜRICH SHINES MORE THE DARKER IT GETS

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:37.419
THEY ARRIVE AT THE OLD TOWN IN ZÜRICH

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.590
[Jung Kook] We don't turn off the camera?

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:42.791
[director] No.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:51.199
ZÜRICH'S OLD TOWN

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.502
We have to turn left
at the riverside there.

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:56.138
Turn left, both of you.

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.073
WHAT KIND OF PLACE DID JIMIN FIND?

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.175
I wish this had a longer handle.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.645
IN A GREAT MOOD

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.380
SUDDENLY SHOUTING OUT J-HOPE

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:09.818
THEY WALK AS THEY HUM

WHAT IS THIS?

01:28:11.987 --> 01:28:13.688
What is this place? It's so pretty.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:19.427
THEY FINALLY MEET THE NIGHT OF ZÜRICH

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:26.668
THE STREETS ARE FILLED WITH RELAXED PEOPLE

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:32.174
EVERYTHING THEY SEE
IS LIKE A PAINTING

01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:34.709
They're taking pictures there.

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.312
This must be a photo spot.
Jung Kook, stand there.

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.548
In the middle.

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.982
Here? All right.

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.785
-Here?
-It's already nice.

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:46.054
This looks cool. I like it.

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:48.557
HOWEVER YOU TAKE A PICTURE IN ZÜRICH,
IT BECOMES ART

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:49.758
Jung Kook, goodness.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.761
What if you fall for the pictures I took?

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:53.829
What's the matter?

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:55.931
Holy.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.465
Let me do it.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:58.700
Surprised, right?

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:00.068
Let me.

01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:02.003
-I'll walk.
-Don't walk.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.172
-Don't?
-Don't.

01:29:04.239 --> 01:29:06.942
PASSIONATELY ON IT

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:10.111
WAITING OBEDIENTLY

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.346
Wait.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.415
Wait.

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:14.883
Jimin, wait.

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:17.719
HIS PASSION EXPLODES

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.088
-Is this how it is?
-A car is coming.

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:21.690
-Dang.
-Dang.

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:25.894
How do you blur the background?
I changed to portrait mode.

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:27.662
But it looks cool.

01:29:28.597 --> 01:29:31.199

Let's go.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.471
I got one nice picture for now.

01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:39.908
Jung Kook, this isn't the main street.
We have to go there.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.176
[Jung Kook] Do we?

01:29:41.243 --> 01:29:42.611
Do we have to walk down?

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:43.879
Yes, all the way down.

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.681
[Jung Kook] There are seven swans
down there.

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:47.883
No, five swans.

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:51.186
IS THIS THE SWAN LAKE...?

01:29:51.253 --> 01:29:53.221
JUNG KOOK HAS OBTAINED SWAN FEED

01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:55.590
Can you raise your head a bit?

01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:58.426
JIMIN WANTS TO TAKE PICTURES OF JUNG KOOK

HOLDING THE SWAN FEED TIGHTLY

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:19.981
Maybe I'll just throw this
as a whole together.

01:30:20.048 --> 01:30:23.618
MAKING A BIG CHUNK

01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:25.253
Wait. I'll do it all at once.

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:26.421
THE TASTE OF OVEREATING

01:30:26.488 --> 01:30:28.189
It's delicious when you overeat.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.726
-Only this one hasn't gotten any.
-I'll make sure it's fed.

FOOD IS COMING DOWN FROM THE SKY,
THE OVEREATING PARTY BEGINS

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:45.907
The second one here isn't...

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:47.509
-Right?
-...eating much.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.177
Should I throw some toward it?

WHILE HE'S TRYING TO FEED IT

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:51.846
You didn't eat, right?

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.381
Hey, duck.

01:30:53.515 --> 01:30:54.783
HOLDING UP THE CAMERA AGAIN

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:55.850
What the?

01:30:56.718 --> 01:30:58.787
-It's strangely beautiful.
-Is it you?

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.223
That guy is a bit slow.

01:31:03.325 --> 01:31:06.227
WHAT ARE YOU FILMING?

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.163
[Jimin laughing]

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:13.435
THE SKY IS BEAUTIFUL, SO WHY...

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.769
You look so excited.

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:18.373
A NEW ANGLE

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:19.874
Eat up.

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.343
THE SWAN DADDY GIVES THEM ALL

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.512
-Let's go.
-Hey.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.247
The view is odd.

01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:28.817
-So pretty.
-Want me to take a photo?

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.652
Oh, you told me to take it vertically.

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.088
[sighs]

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.622
Gosh, this is...

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.257
The sky is amazing.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.227
-Look.
-Really?

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.663
EVERY PHOTO THEY TAKE IS LIKE ART

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.731
[Jung Kook] Let me.

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:45.300
-Jimin.
-Yes?

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:48.703
A COOL POSE

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.872
Let's go a little from one end.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.807
Almost there.

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.209
A little less.

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.276
IS HE DONE?

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.778
OH, HE'S NOT

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.646
Wait a bit.

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:01.282
-Look.
-What?

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.984
How long until you take it?

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:05.854
THE RESULT OF HIS WAITING IS COMING SOON

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.190
SQUATTING FOR THE BEST PHOTO

01:32:10.492 --> 01:32:13.428
A SENTIMENTAL PHOTO
EARNED THANKS TO SQUATTING

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:15.663

-[Jimin] This vibe?
-Isn't it great?

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:20.235
HE LOVES IT

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:22.504
It's worth being on
my social media profile.

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:23.772
Of course.

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.475
Well taken, right?

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.278
[Jimin] Goodness.

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:31.413
It sure is beautiful.

01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:37.285
WHERE IS JIMIN?

01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:42.390
JIMIN IS TAKING PICTURES AGAIN

01:32:42.457 --> 01:32:46.061
JUNG KOOK IS PLAYING WITH A SWAN AGAIN

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:49.030
[Jimin] Did it grow on you
after meeting it yesterday?

01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:50.498
No, it's a different one.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.300
-It followed us.
-Really?

01:32:52.367 --> 01:32:54.202
Because it didn't get your autograph.

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:55.303
We walked quite a lot.

01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:56.905
We came pretty far.

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:58.139
Let me check.

01:32:59.007 --> 01:33:00.708
[Jung Kook] Where is the pretty spot?

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:03.344
[Jimin] There's a place called Lindenhof.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:06.648
We have to walk toward the left
and go up somewhere.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.016
-Do we?
-Yes.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:09.217
Can you count on me?

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:10.285
Of course.

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:15.990
I saw this beautiful river view
down from a stone wall.

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.559
♪ A beautiful view ♪

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:18.626
SPEEDING UP

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:21.296
We should slow down a little
for them to film easier.

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:24.466
IN SELF SLOW MOTION

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:26.134
[Jung Kook] Naturally.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:31.573
THEY'RE EVEN GOOD AT THIS

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:34.275
SLOWLY AND ELEGANTLY

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.612
I can't keep my balance
if you pull me like that.

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:43.451
WALKING IN SLOW MOTION

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:47.422
Over there.

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:56.264
THAT'S IT FOR THE SLOW MOTION PERFORMANCE

01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:59.634
WALKING TOWARD LINDENHOF

01:34:00.268 --> 01:34:01.269
It's nice.

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.806
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:34:04.873 --> 01:34:07.208
A CLOSE-UP ATTACK

01:34:07.275 --> 01:34:08.276
Is it their language?

01:34:08.343 --> 01:34:10.378
SWITZERLAND HAS FOUR NATIONAL LANGUAGES

01:34:10.445 --> 01:34:12.747
JE T'AIME, EVERYONE

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.516
This neighborhood is beautiful.

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:15.583
It is.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.418
-It reminds me of Malta.
-Yes.

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:20.588
-The place we first went to.
-Right.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:22.023
I miss Malta.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.259
But we didn't even know its capital city.

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.495
MALTA'S CAPITAL IS VALLETTA

01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:28.563
A HILL SHOWS UP

01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:29.964
-[Jung Kook] Is this it?
-Yes.

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:33.568
Beauty is bound to follow
after a huge pain.

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:34.736
Is there such a saying?

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:37.839
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF IT

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:38.940
Beauty after a pain?

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.342
-Haven't you heard of it?
-After a BP...

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:44.345
After a huge pain,
beauty is bound to follow.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:48.316
HOW MUCH OF A BEAUTY
WILL FOLLOW AFTER THIS PAIN...

01:34:48.383 --> 01:34:50.451
I don't find it tough.

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:53.555
Do you hear me pant?

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.722
You don't.

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:57.759
You're not panting
because you're holding your breath.

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.093
I'm not.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.429
I'm breathing and talking.

01:35:01.496 --> 01:35:03.331
If you run out of breath over this...

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.767
A BIG SIGH AFTER JUST ONE SECOND

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:07.001
-Is it tiring?
-No.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:09.170
-This is it.
-Because the air is fresh.

01:35:09.237 --> 01:35:11.039
[Jimin] I think we have to go that way.

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.574
-[Jung Kook] We do?
-Yes.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.410
-Nice.
-Please trust and follow me.

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:18.479
The fresh air makes me
want to take a breath.

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.882
HE'S NOT TIRED, HE'S TAKING A BREATH

01:35:20.949 --> 01:35:22.517
It's pretty.

01:35:22.584 --> 01:35:25.186
-Is it satisfying?
-After a pain...

01:35:25.253 --> 01:35:28.323
-Beauty follows, I said. Trust me.
-beauty...

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:29.424
WHERE THEY ARE

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:31.859
THEY CAN HAVE A FULL VIEW OF THE OLD TOWN

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:34.128
-It's much prettier here.
-It's prettier here.

01:35:34.996 --> 01:35:36.364
YOU CAN BE TRUELY RELAXED HERE

01:35:36.431 --> 01:35:38.633
It's not bad.

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:43.137
The river and stuff
must've looked much prettier

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:45.673
if we'd come when the sun set.

01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:48.876
TAKING PICTURES TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT

01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:50.545
It's scary.

01:35:50.612 --> 01:35:51.613
ESCAPING RIGHT AWAY

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:54.282
We should've come
around when the sun was setting.

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:58.119
-But it's still so beautiful.
-It's nice.

01:35:59.654 --> 01:36:03.625
ENJOYING THE NIGHT VIEW
SITTING ON THE STONE WALL SIDE BY SIDE

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:07.996
THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER PAGE OF MEMORIES

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:15.036
ENJOYING THE NIGHT VIEW TOGETHER SILENTLY

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.907
WE'LL COME AGAIN

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:23.077
FORCING THEMSELVES TO RETURN

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:25.246
Jung Kook, stay still already.

01:36:25.313 --> 01:36:26.848
What?

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.583
You should've told me.

01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:29.751
-I am now.
-Right?

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.753
-Don't look here.
-Okay.

01:36:32.587 --> 01:36:36.524
-I'll walk slowly. Jeez.
-No, don't move at all.

01:36:37.058 --> 01:36:39.827
There you go. Focus here, you brat.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:42.163
-[Jimin] How cool.
-What?

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.398
[Jimin] Why am I so good?

01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:47.769
DANCING

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:52.840
THE RHYTHM HAS TAKEN OVER JUNG KOOK

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:55.376
THE STAFF SPOTS A WELL

01:36:55.443 --> 01:36:57.111
A WELL?

01:36:58.079 --> 01:36:59.447
Gosh, it's deep.

01:36:59.514 --> 01:37:01.115
Does it have water down there?

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.818
IT'S LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE OLD TOWN

01:37:03.885 --> 01:37:07.922
UNDERGROUND WATER TAKES UP 80 PERCENT OF
DRINKING WATER AND THE REST IS FROM LAKES

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:08.990
Junsoo.

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:10.058
[exclaims]

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.693
[both laughing]

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.461
CAMERA: PLEASE SPARE ME

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:16.230
HIS PRANKS ARE NEVER-ENDING

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.466
STAFF: AT LEAST SPARE THE MEMORY CARD

01:37:18.533 --> 01:37:20.735
A fall warning popped up.

01:37:20.802 --> 01:37:22.570
-A fall warning?
-Yes.

01:37:22.637 --> 01:37:25.406
AND HIS ALONE TIME
WITH THE CAMERA BEGINS...

01:37:25.473 --> 01:37:28.576
EXPERIENCING ZERO GRAVITY

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.379
STRETCHING

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.348
A drone view.

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.582
Jimin, a drone view.

01:37:34.649 --> 01:37:35.850
LIKE A HUMAN CAMERA CRANE

01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:37.819
-Who are you filming?
-Just ahead of me.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.955
A view of our feet.

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:44.459
EXPERIENCING HOW IT FEELS TO BE THEIR BAGS

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.727
THEY ARRIVE AT THE SQUARE

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:47.762
-We're back quickly.
-Right.

01:37:47.829 --> 01:37:49.831
[Jimin humming]

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:53.768
It'll be nice if we have a few glasses
of beer since it's our last night.

01:37:53.835 --> 01:37:55.670
-All together?
-Yes.

01:37:55.737 --> 01:37:56.838
Then let's buy some.

01:37:56.904 --> 01:37:58.439
Our last night in Switzerland.

01:37:58.506 --> 01:37:59.974
Let's have it by the hotel.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:01.709
That sounds nice too.

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:05.246
Do we buy some beer?
The hotel must have beer.

01:38:05.313 --> 01:38:07.215
-You're right.
-We have a veranda.

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:08.282
[Jimin] Let's go in.

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:11.819
-We can use the franc only here, right?
-Yes.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.323
I've pocketed and saved
quite a lot of francs.

01:38:16.691 --> 01:38:18.659
I've saved them little by little

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.795
-to feed you.
-What?

01:38:22.797 --> 01:38:24.665
Do you get how an elder member feels?

01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:29.804
BEEP

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.411
[Jimin] I'll just have wine, then.

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.478
No.

01:38:38.346 --> 01:38:42.817
DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF WINE

01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:44.352
I want water too.

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:45.753
I put my mouth to it.

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:46.988
Do you want a new bottle?

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.556
-You have it?
-Yes.

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:50.525
Then I'd like one.

01:38:52.427 --> 01:38:55.029
NOT FOR FREE

01:38:57.532 --> 01:38:58.699
-Jung Kook.
-What?

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.234
Say, "Please."

01:39:00.802 --> 01:39:01.936
Just give it to me.

01:39:02.003 --> 01:39:03.337
"Please."

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.639
Are you kidding me?

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.841
I'm 27.

01:39:06.908 --> 01:39:08.376
JIMIN DOESN'T GIVE UP

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.278
I'm too old for that.

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:12.280
-"Please."
-[yells]

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.347
Do you see it?

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.618
Please.

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.287
Please.

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:22.056
THRILLED

01:39:24.592 --> 01:39:26.127
I didn't hear it.

01:39:26.194 --> 01:39:28.663
You should've listened carefully.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:31.098
Come on. The water is with me.

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:32.500
Once is enough.

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:33.768
I didn't hear it!

01:39:33.835 --> 01:39:34.969
Jeez!

01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:38.406
"Please."

01:39:38.473 --> 01:39:40.174
Goodness.

01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:41.776
DEEPLY TORN

01:39:41.843 --> 01:39:43.044
I'll hand it right away.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.112
Okay. Please.

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:47.181
[Jimin laughs]

01:39:47.248 --> 01:39:48.783
-That's not it.
-I did it.

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:50.985
-"Please."
-Please.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:52.653
Isn't this it?

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:54.889
HE'S AWARDED WITH WATER

01:39:54.956 --> 01:39:56.023
I did it right!

01:39:57.625 --> 01:39:59.694
JIMIN LOVES IT THE MORE HE THINKS OF IT

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.162
It's hilarious.

01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:03.030
Gosh, it's hilarious.

01:40:04.699 --> 01:40:06.701
That was a legendary scene.

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:08.002
I better clap in advance.

01:40:08.069 --> 01:40:09.203
MARKING HIS CUTE SCENE

01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:10.438
It's nice.

01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:13.107
THE CAMERA TURNED OFF AT THIS MOMENT...

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:14.342
-It turned off.
-Really?

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.010
I even clapped.

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.780
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.650
This is the last night in Switzerland.

01:40:24.919 --> 01:40:25.920
How do you feel?

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:30.925
Uh, it was short, and even shorter.

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:33.828
HE JUST MEANS HE'S SAD IT'S ENDING

01:40:33.895 --> 01:40:35.463
It's a shame.

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:36.531
"Please."

01:40:36.597 --> 01:40:39.967
But this isn't the end of this show.

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:42.169
We don't know how things will be.

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.638
If you think this show

01:40:44.906 --> 01:40:46.207
will end with this,

01:40:46.274 --> 01:40:47.909
that's a huge misunderstanding.

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.277
Humongous.

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:50.878
A humongous misunderstanding.

01:40:50.945 --> 01:40:53.014
We could go to Busan.

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.149
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA?

01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:56.684
We have to go to Busan, though.

01:40:56.751 --> 01:40:57.818
Why?

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.921
-It's our hometown.
-You don't know much.

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:00.988
That's why I must go.

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.089
I don't know either.

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.157
Exactly.

01:41:03.224 --> 01:41:04.225
There are

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:07.228
-many beautiful places in Busan.
-Right.

01:41:07.295 --> 01:41:08.696
I don't know much about Busan.

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:09.997
I know less.

01:41:10.665 --> 01:41:14.001
I moved to Seoul when I was 15.
I didn't get to do anything there.

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:16.671
You were a little kid.

01:41:17.505 --> 01:41:19.774
Gosh, it was so nice in Switzerland.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.310
If only we could speak
better English, right?

01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:25.212
Our trip would've been more pleasant.

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:27.915
Anyway, the francs we have left,

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:30.518
we can't spend it anymore, right?

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:32.386
You can exchange them.

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:34.789
That could actually be better, Jimin.

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.357
-The exchange rate is high.
-Yes.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:39.360
-If we exchange it there, it's better.
-Right.

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.128
THE NIGHT DEEPENS,

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:43.664
ALONG WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS
FOR THE NEXT TRAVEL SPOT

01:41:44.532 --> 01:41:46.200
-[Jimin] Will you film it?
-Me?

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.335
[Jimin] Yes, it's nice.

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:49.170
-Film it well.
-Okay.

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.341
THEY'RE BEHIND THE WALL

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:56.277
REHEARSING

01:41:56.344 --> 01:41:58.045
[♪ upbeat music playing]

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:02.016
HAVING A WORK MOMENT AFTER A WHILE
SINCE THE TRIP BEGAN

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.719
[Jimin] What do you think?

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:08.689
MONITORING THE REHEARSAL VIDEO

01:42:08.756 --> 01:42:10.825
Why don't we do it like this?

01:42:10.925 --> 01:42:11.926
THE CLIENT LIKES IT

01:42:12.026 --> 01:42:15.229
SETTING UP THE LIGHTING

01:42:15.296 --> 01:42:16.497
No, it was better before.

01:42:16.564 --> 01:42:17.898
-[Jimin] This?
-Yes.

01:42:17.999 --> 01:42:19.867
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

01:42:19.934 --> 01:42:21.135
Let's film it.

01:42:21.736 --> 01:42:24.205
THE DIRECTOR IS READY

01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:34.015
WHERE JUNG KOOK IS

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:36.384
LAUGHING

01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:39.487
A COOL ENDING

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:42.723
-What? Did I make many mistakes?
-No.

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:46.227
MONITORING THE CHALLENGE VIDEO

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:50.765
THE CLIENT LOVES IT

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:01.709
#JIMIN &amp; JUNG KOOK'S JOINT WORK
#CHALLENGE_SUCCESS

01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:04.745
THANKS, JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK

01:43:06.447 --> 01:43:08.749
Gosh, I can't speak English.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.319
What is this?

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.056
CHECKING THE PRODUCT NAME FIRST

01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:19.527
HIS SHOULDERS SHOW A LACK OF CONFIDENCE

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:21.462
Gosh, I feel pressured.

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:25.099
HE TAKES THE ROOM PHONE AFTER HESITATING

01:43:25.166 --> 01:43:28.002
JUNG KOOK ARRIVES JUST IN TIME

01:43:28.069 --> 01:43:29.070
What's that?

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:31.072
I'm going to order beer.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.276
-Jimin, do I wash up first?
-Yes.

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:38.913
NERVOUS

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:43.884
GETTING HELP FROM A TRANSLATOR

01:43:44.452 --> 01:43:46.120
[in English] Room number...

01:43:49.123 --> 01:43:50.124
Yeah.

01:43:50.858 --> 01:43:51.892
Yes.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.428
Thank you.

01:43:54.495 --> 01:43:57.732
HE SMOOTHLY MAKES AN ORDER

01:43:58.332 --> 01:44:01.202
THANKS TO JIMIN,
THEY GET TO SOOTHE THEIR SADNESS...

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:05.039
THE DARK NIGHT IN ZÜRICH PASSES

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:08.743
AND THE LAST MORNING IN SWITZERLAND
FINALLY COMES

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:12.279
THE SUNLIGHT SHINES DOWN
AS IF TO SOOTH THEIR SADNESS

01:44:12.947 --> 01:44:14.882
[Jung Kook] Where is it?
Where could it be?

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:18.352
THEY ARE UP EARLY TO PACK UP

01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:19.754
Where? I have no idea.

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:21.956
I'm clueless.

01:44:22.523 --> 01:44:25.426
I'LL GET GOING FIRST

01:44:25.493 --> 01:44:28.696
I didn't know how long the flight will be,
so I slept really late.

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:30.664
I didn't...

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:33.901
fall sleep until after 5 a.m.

01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:34.969
5:30 a.m.?

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:39.507
Then I couldn't resist...

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:42.443
and fell asleep. Hold on.

01:44:43.144 --> 01:44:44.512
Is Jimin good on his own?

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:49.517
KIND-HEARTED JUNG KOOK WAITED FOR HIM

01:44:53.521 --> 01:44:55.523
I had so much fun in Switzerland.

01:44:57.191 --> 01:44:58.959
[in Korean] It was fun, thankfully.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:02.096
[Jung Kook speaking indistinctly]

01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:05.499
I slept well by mistake.

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.302
You slept well by mistake?

01:45:08.369 --> 01:45:11.138
I didn't want to sleep.
You saw me doze off and slept.

01:45:11.205 --> 01:45:12.206
Yes.

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.511
"I can't sleep now..."

01:45:17.578 --> 01:45:19.914
HE PASSED OUT

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.416
GREETING WITH HIS EYES

01:45:23.217 --> 01:45:24.618
Hello.

01:45:26.287 --> 01:45:27.955
Will you drive? Or should I?

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.257
-Why don't I do it this time?
-Okay.

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:31.826
JIMIN IS TO DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:41.702
PUTTING THE LUGGAGE IN THE CAR

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:43.337
Off we go.

01:45:43.404 --> 01:45:47.608
OFF TO THE AIRPORT!

01:45:50.144 --> 01:45:51.745
[Jung Kook] Which one is my camera?

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:54.014
I'm waving my hand so hard.

01:45:56.317 --> 01:45:59.253
HIS BODY SHAKES TOO

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.624
[Jung Kook] The weather is so nice
with only a few clouds.

01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:05.759
AS THEY TAKE IN THE STREETS
FOR THE LAST TIME

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:07.461
We're almost there.

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:09.730
THEY ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT

01:46:09.797 --> 01:46:12.199
I had a good time in Switzerland.

01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:16.270
A camera popped up again.

01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:18.873
WAVING AUTOMATICALLY

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:19.940
Can it capture this?

01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:21.442
Probably not.

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.377
IT DID CAPTURE IT

01:46:23.444 --> 01:46:24.912
The last moment in Switzerland.

01:46:24.979 --> 01:46:25.980
The last moment.

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:29.884
THEY ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT

01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:32.653
WHERE COULD THEIR NEXT TRAVEL SPOT BE...?

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.657
WAITING IN THE CAR FOR A BIT

01:46:38.659 --> 01:46:43.664
Wait. What if some cute music
is played to this dancing scene?

01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:46.934
THEN HE'LL LOOK CUTE AND ADORABLE

01:46:47.001 --> 01:46:50.437
SHOWING OFF HIS HIDDEN CHARM

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:56.410
IT STRANGELY GOES WELL...

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:03.150
ANYONE CAN TELL IT'S SUSPICIOUS

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:06.020
They're here!

01:47:06.587 --> 01:47:08.055
THEY'RE GIVEN THEIR TICKETS

01:47:08.122 --> 01:47:09.523
Let's see where we're going.

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:14.728
LET'S SEE

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:19.400
What?

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:20.467
It says Incheon.

01:47:21.135 --> 01:47:23.170
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:47:23.237 --> 01:47:24.939
-You're right.
-Incheon?

01:47:25.506 --> 01:47:26.740
Are we going to Korea?

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:27.908
And transfer there.

01:47:27.975 --> 01:47:29.109
-For real?
-What?

01:47:30.144 --> 01:47:31.512
Don't lie.

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:34.048
Why do we transfer in Korea?

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:37.952
I mean, we'll go
all the way there to transfer?

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:39.954
Can that be?

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.488
It's a lie.

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:43.724
Don't lie!

01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:45.759
What do you take us for?

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:47.027
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

01:47:47.094 --> 01:47:51.198
You had something scheduled on the 29th,
but you canceled it because of this.

01:47:51.265 --> 01:47:56.470
I had a dance lesson scheduled
on the 28th and 29th,

01:47:56.537 --> 01:47:59.306
but you said we'd still be abroad then.

01:47:59.373 --> 01:48:00.908
It was a lie, I think.

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:02.076
How confusing.

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:04.645
They did it to confuse you.

01:48:04.712 --> 01:48:07.314
[singing]

01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:10.250
I didn't even imagine it'd be Incheon.

01:48:11.352 --> 01:48:13.520
Where in Korea, though?

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.860
Let's go to Korea!

01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:25.432
WE'RE GOING TO KOREA!

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:29.436
Let's go!

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:33.941
WE'RE OFF TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.350
THEY'VE TAKEN THE FIRST CLASS SEATS

01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:47.021
Jimin, here I am.

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.189
Ouch, my head.

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:53.260
IT'S ALWAYS EXCITING TO BE ON A FLIGHT

01:48:53.327 --> 01:48:54.795
[Jung Kook singing]

01:48:56.797 --> 01:49:01.402
THEY ONLY HAVE TO REST UP NOW

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.437
[in Korean] Jung Kook, my hands are dry.

01:49:03.504 --> 01:49:04.638
Apply some hand cream.

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:06.073
Oh, that will do.

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.241
Let me apply some.

01:49:09.443 --> 01:49:11.178
SMELLING

01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:16.216
Is this hand cream? It looks so pretty.

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:20.621
TAKING ENOUGH ON HIS HAND

01:49:21.188 --> 01:49:23.157
CHECKING ITS SCENT

01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:28.162
APPLYING IT THOROUGHLY TO MAKE THEM MOIST

01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:34.768
LETTING HIM FEEL THE GOOD SCENT

01:49:35.569 --> 01:49:36.770
EMBARRASSED

01:49:36.837 --> 01:49:38.005
Don't you smell anything?

01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:39.073
I did.

01:49:40.474 --> 01:49:41.775
Oh, you had it near my nose?

01:49:41.842 --> 01:49:44.144
-Yes.
-No wonder why.

01:49:44.211 --> 01:49:46.013
I was like, "Something smells nice."

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.549
JIMIN LOVES THIS HAND CREAM

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:52.653
THE PLANE TAKING OFF SMOOTHLY

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:02.963
SLEEPY...

01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:09.336
JIMIN IS FIGHTING SLEEP

01:50:13.574 --> 01:50:17.377
FALLING ASLEEP FEELING MUCH MORE AT EASE

01:50:18.312 --> 01:50:20.247
JUNG KOOK WAKES UP BRIEFLY

01:50:20.314 --> 01:50:23.350
HE CHECKS ON JIMIN

01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:26.320
AND FALLS ASLEEP AGAIN...

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:31.825
THEY WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
EVEN IF SOMEONE KIDNAPS THEM

01:50:31.892 --> 01:50:36.597
JIMIN WAKES UP

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.801
Jung Kook.

01:50:42.503 --> 01:50:48.575
JUNG KOOK'S SLEEP PROTECTOR

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:51.145
LETTING HIM SLEEP AND ORDERING A MEAL

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.180
-[in English] It's okay.
-Good? Perfect.

01:50:53.247 --> 01:50:55.415
[in Korean] I finally get to have
Korean food.

01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:57.651
Kimchi.

01:50:58.252 --> 01:50:59.253
Finally.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.088
A Korean food-eating video.

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:05.192
GETTING READY TO DIG IN

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:10.397
SAVORING

01:51:10.464 --> 01:51:17.471
BUSY ENJOYING LONG-AWAITED KOREAN FOOD

01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:23.010
Gosh, I'm full.

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.078
I'm so full.

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:29.349
SEE YOU IN A BIT

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:33.320
WHILE THE TWO ARE SOUND ASLEEP,

01:51:33.387 --> 01:51:37.558
THEY'RE GETTING FARTHER AWAY
FROM SWITZERLAND

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.626
JUNG KOOK WAKES UP AGAIN

01:51:40.394 --> 01:51:43.030
SNACKS ARE SERVED
TO PASSENGERS WHO ARE AWAKE

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:47.901
LET'S SEE...

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.772
CHOOSING CHOCOLATE VERY CAREFULLY

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.674
-[in English] This.
-You can take it.

01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:57.511
You can have more.

01:51:57.578 --> 01:51:58.579
ONE MORE...?

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.380
IT'S SO HARD TO CHOOSE JUST ONE...

01:52:01.348 --> 01:52:03.650
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT OFFERS
THE WHOLE BOX TO HIM

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:04.718
Really?

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.054
AN UNEXPECTED GIFT

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.255
Thank you.

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.061
[in Korean] She gave me all the chocolate.

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.297
THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:19.967
I love sweets.

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.102
And she gave me

01:52:23.437 --> 01:52:24.538
all the chocolate.

01:52:27.441 --> 01:52:28.809
It's good.

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:33.247
I should have just one more,
hide the rest...

01:52:35.282 --> 01:52:36.717
and give it to the staff.

01:52:38.652 --> 01:52:41.488
HE'S SO SWEET...

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:47.861
[exclaiming softly in delight]

01:52:50.564 --> 01:52:53.533
THE GIFT MADE HIM ALL HAPPY

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.735
Chocolate.

01:52:55.636 --> 01:52:57.404
Chocolate.

01:52:57.471 --> 01:52:59.873
I got chocolate.

01:53:01.208 --> 01:53:02.943
Goodness.

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.711
Stay in there.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:08.248
HE KEEPS IT SAFE

01:53:08.315 --> 01:53:09.650
[groans]

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:10.817
Let's lie down.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:13.787
LET'S LIE DOWN AGAIN

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:21.094
This is what happiness is.

01:53:25.966 --> 01:53:28.468
OH, RIGHT

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:31.538
Bye.

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:33.840
Goodbye.

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.310
This is a mic.

01:53:36.376 --> 01:53:38.045
HE REVEALS HIS SWEET GIFT SET

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:41.081
I had its battery fully charged.

01:53:42.049 --> 01:53:43.350
Huh.

01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:47.654
I recharged Jimin's camera and mine too.

01:53:47.721 --> 01:53:50.157
I'm even recharging a portable battery.

01:53:51.358 --> 01:53:52.893
SINCERE THANKS FROM THE STAFF...

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.094
Do you get it?

01:53:54.161 --> 01:53:57.698
YOU REALLY ARE THE BEST

01:53:58.432 --> 01:54:03.437
Anyway, we're arriving in Korea
in two hours and 20 minutes.

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:06.907
Let me rest up until then.

01:54:06.973 --> 01:54:09.176
HE'S OFF TO RECHARGE HIMSELF FOR REAL NOW

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:13.580
GETTING CLOSER TO THE NEXT DESTINATION
AFTER THE TRIP IN SWITZERLAND...

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:18.151
WHAT KINDS OF PLACES AND MEMORIES
ARE WAITING FOR US?

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.953
-[director] All right, guys.
-Yes?

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.588
This show isn't over.

01:54:21.655 --> 01:54:23.290
CONFUSED

01:54:23.357 --> 01:54:25.792
This is a kit for the next travel spot.

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:29.229
Why don't I have it?

01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:31.665
THE NEXT DESTINATION MAKES HIM LAUGH

01:54:31.732 --> 01:54:33.600
Our next travel spot is...

01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:38.405
-Right away.
-Is this right?

01:54:38.472 --> 01:54:40.307
We are. All right, then.

01:54:40.374 --> 01:54:41.842
WHERE'S THE NEXT TRAVEL SPOT?

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:43.210
IT WILL BE REVEALED NEXT WEEK

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.878
-There are so many people.
-It sure is different.

01:54:44.945 --> 01:54:46.947
