I told him not to park here. Damn it.

I told him not to park there.

He just won't listen.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.450
Right.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.152
Are you here to see the building?

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:26.420
Have you already looked around?

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:28.422
But where's the owner?

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:30.924

Damn it.

Why isn't he picking up?

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.844

Good work, everyone.

Ha Ri, relax. It was an accident.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.100
You look scary.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:21.768
Doesn't she?

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.670
I'm just tired. That's all.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.072
I see.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.707
You worked so hard.
You were amazing.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:27.875
Thanks. Cheers.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.010

You were incredible.

Was I?

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.346
She was amazing, right?

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.349
Sir, have an apple.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:36.950
- I'm fine.
- Come on, have some.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.985
No, I'm okay.

I drank too much.
I'm going to the restroom.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.570
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.304
Go ahead.

Why are you only coming out now?

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.961
I knocked way earlier
to tell you to come out.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:23.630
I mean,

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:25.766

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.168
I can't even.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.170
You forgot the dance earlier, didn't you?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.272
Hey, I've got a reason
to feel a little wronged.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.407
It's not that I forgot, but...

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:34.942
Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.777
You've been forgetting everything
for seven years.

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.745
I saw you biting your lips.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.813
Whenever you get anxious,

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.882
you do this.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.418
So why, damn it,

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.220
did you have to suggest tango
of all things?

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:49.356
Well, I heard the director
was learning tango, so...

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.561
Still, if I'd just landed it at the end,

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:57.064
you'd be getting promoted this time.
What a waste.

00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.533
Why are you so fixated
on promotions lately?

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:01.835
Whatever.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.770
What are we doing tomorrow?

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:05.239
What about tomorrow?

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.575
- Don't tell me you...
- I didn't forget.

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.544
We're going to the ranch
to see the horses.

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:12.379
I didn't forget.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.414
I'm going to tell them I have a wedding
and take a taxi early.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.583
- You make up another excuse, okay?
- Okay.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.819
Don't stammer like an idiot again.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.187
I'm not an idiot, okay?

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.723
You're always nagging me.

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.658
The assistant manager
was looking for you. Let's go back in.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.629
Come on.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:29.696
Why?

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:31.865
Was the apple good?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.734
What?

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.644
It doesn't hurt at all.
Only your hand hurts.

Damn it.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.858
Hey.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:58.759
Why?

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.435
Hey, Kang...

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:11.038
It looks like Ha Ri's got that ready.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.677
- Yes, as you told me,
- Look at the horse.

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:19.213
I'll sort out the schedule
and let you know.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.747
Yes.

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:24.885
Yes, thank you.

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.222
Wait, my hand's sweaty.

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:30.557
So where are we going now?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.728
Why do you always ask me?

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:35.863
Anywhere.

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:39.099
If we go "anywhere,"
you'll complain again.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.469
Hey, Ha Ri, where are you going?

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:46.340
Damn it, why is she like that again?

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:50.477
No.

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.251
It's raining so hard.

00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:00.087
Hey, I can't see the road at all.

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:01.555
- Sorry.
- Can you see?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.826
I can't really see either.
What do we do?

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.763
- Goodness.
- What?

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.267
Why is it doing this?

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:15.435
What's wrong?

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.904
- The wiper...
- What?

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:19.406
This isn't good. Hold on.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:21.808
What's wrong?

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.777
Wait, just a second.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.078
Where are you going?

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.513
The wiper's not working.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.215
I can't see in front of me.

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:29.383
Just leave it.

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:31.518
You can just wipe it.

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:32.486
Hold on.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:33.487

- What are you doing? Just get in.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.097
Hurry up.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.801
Get inside. Hurry.

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.239
Why are you this soaked?

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:53.774
Just keep walking already.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.544
Hello?

00:07:57.878 --> 00:07:58.879
Is anyone here?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.585
It doesn't look like they're open.

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:07.154
Let's just wait in the car
and go when the rain stops.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.777
You scared me.

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.180
Hello.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.982
I thought no one was here.
What a relief.

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:41.021
Do you have a room?

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.425
It's raining a lot outside, right?

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:47.794
Yes.

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:53.967
- Take this.
- Okay.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:54.868
Thank you.

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:58.172
Sir, your cheek.

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:03.710
Get some rest.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:06.146
Okay.

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:06.947
Yes.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.382
Thank you.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:12.886
Sir.

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:30.037
Is there a charger in the room?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.842
Give me your phone.
I'll bring it to you later.

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.778
So there isn't one. I'm glad I asked.

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:38.645
Thank you.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.249
Did it die again?

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.684
I told you to bring the charger.

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:45.285
You never pack what you need.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.487
Just come already.

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:07.841
Saving it up and eating it all at once
is the best part.

00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:12.112
You can wait a little more, right?

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:26.894
Earlier, on the owner's cheek,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.329
didn't that look like blood?

00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.072
That's not funny.

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:40.674
Too bad.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.311
He looks kind of familiar.

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:47.247
Where have I seen him?

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.394
In the middle of this,
you want to organize the schedule?

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:02.429
You've got a good memory.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:04.665
I forget everything.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.835
The call I got earlier today
was about the changed schedule.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.814
What?
Why are they being so loud?

00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:22.449
They must be in the good phase.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.251
We were like that at first too.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.220
Don't you remember? The meeting room.

00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:36.396
Be quiet.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.835
Ha Ri, I love you.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.437
I really, really love you.

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:44.605
You're handsome.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.306
It's thrilling.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.916
We freaked out
when people suddenly walked in.

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.384
If we'd gotten caught then...

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:05.225
Why? What?

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:14.168
Okay.

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:16.670
I'll call the front desk.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:22.743
What?

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.646
The phone doesn't work.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.282
Forget it. That's not what this is about.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.755
Then what is it?

00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:42.663
Just tell me.

00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:44.531
Stop driving me crazy.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:47.801
I'm driving you crazy?

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.403
I just haven't said it out loud,

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:51.205
but you've been like that lately.

00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:53.574
You're either sulking or snapping.

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:54.708
And you're being distant.

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:57.778
You were on your phone
all day today, right?

00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:58.712
That's...

00:12:58.712 --> 00:12:59.880
Even earlier,
when we went to see the horses,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.149
we were the only couple not holding hands.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.852
And what?
"They must be in the good phase?"

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.119
"We were like that too?"

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.055
Then what about now?
What phase are we in now?

00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:09.556
For you,

00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:11.725
I don't even register.

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:12.893
We just keep dating like this,
and that's it.

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.561
Do you have any kind of plan with me?

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.196
No, you don't. Of course not.

00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:18.632
What kind of plan?

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:21.001
What's the problem?
Why are you doing this?

00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:24.705
Stop twisting my words.
It makes people lose it.

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:32.112
So this is it.
That damn thing hit you too.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:33.814
What thing?

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.349
Everything's boring
because you know it all.

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:36.750
You yawn when we're together.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.653
Honestly, you're even annoyed now
because I'm being like this, right?

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:41.221
That's what a slump is.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.392
They're crossing the line.

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.294
Where are you going? Just leave it.

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:49.997
Don't go.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.668
Those people have no manners.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:01.508
Excuse me. We're downstairs.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.810
It sounds like you're moving
furniture around.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.078
You can't do that.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.847
It's really loud.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:11.785
Excuse me.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.389
What?

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:05.205
Blood.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.241
Blood...

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:12.379
Sir.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:13.914
Are you okay?

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.222
Please help me.

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.626
Call the police.

00:15:25.626 --> 00:15:27.094
The police?

00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:28.328
That bastard...

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:29.730
Pardon?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.398
That bastard...

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:35.469
Who is "that bastard?"

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:38.539
No, I'll...

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.674
I'll call the owner of the place for you.

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.745
I'm the owner.

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:46.713
I'm the owner.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.787
Is that bastard still here?

00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:55.155
What?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.456
Get some rest.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.558
It's raining a lot outside, right?

00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:58.625
I'll bring it to you later.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.760
Go inside. Get some rest.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.961
It's raining a lot outside, right?

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:07.367
This won't come loose.

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:16.643
Looks like he talked.

00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:31.658
What?

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:35.662
Damn it. I told him not to go.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.702
Please save me.

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:55.415
Where are they?

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:56.650
What?

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.120
I know there's someone here.
Where are they?

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:02.222
I don't know.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.092
I really don't know.

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:23.377
Hello.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:31.051
What? The owner?

00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:32.452
Ha Ri.

00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:33.587
Dong Gu.

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:34.454
What is this?

00:17:35.022 --> 00:17:36.023
Ha Ri.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.091
Get out.

00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:39.226
What? Why?

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.401
Damn it. Hurry.

00:17:49.303 --> 00:17:50.437
Come on.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:53.140
Where are we going?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.276
Where are we going?

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.480
What do we do?

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:03.083
What do we do?

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:05.719
Your phone.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.521
Your phone's at the front desk, right?

00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:08.322
Yeah.

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:10.424
What?

00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:12.092
Damn it.

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:17.264
Let me think.

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:19.099
Ha Ri.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.034
Your phone's in the room, right?

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.002
Yeah.

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.339
Why?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.542
Why? Don't do that.

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.782
Are you unhappy with the service?

00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:39.520
No, I like it, but it's a little scary.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.555
The...

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:51.498
What now?

00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:52.933
What do we do?

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:56.069
Why isn't it coming?

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:07.281
Hey, get a grip and listen to me.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.117
You remember the meeting room, right?

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:11.018
You're handsome.

00:19:11.018 --> 00:19:11.785
It's thrilling.

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.723
Are you crazy?

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:22.563
If you just trust me,

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:25.499
we'll be okay.

00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:29.436
Damn it.

00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:38.178
One.

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:41.615
Two.

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:45.219
Three.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:18.685
I'll be right back, honey.

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:20.654
Don't call her "honey."

00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:22.656
Time out.

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:06.300
My phone.

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:08.068
My phone.

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:13.273
What?

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.141
(Call failed)

00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:16.310
What's wrong with this?

00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:18.879
Damn it.

00:21:20.547 --> 00:21:22.516
What? Why won't it work?

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:38.532
Dong Gu.

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.703
Dong Gu.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.138
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:49.076
Why are you so quiet, Kang Dong Gu?

00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:53.380
It's really quiet.

00:21:54.047 --> 00:21:57.484
Hey, Dong Gu. Say something.

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:17.104
Damn it.

00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:26.246
Sir.

00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:29.283
Sir.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.385
Sir.

00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:33.820
Sir.

00:22:36.757 --> 00:22:37.925
Sir.

00:22:38.959 --> 00:22:39.860
Sir.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.299
(Police)

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:49.770
Damn it.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.871
(Please report to the police.)

00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:54.174
(A person dead at the motel)

00:22:54.174 --> 00:22:55.275
(Report to police,
Person dead)

00:23:14.962 --> 00:23:15.929
Sir.

00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:17.331
Sir, here.

00:23:18.065 --> 00:23:18.966
Sir.

00:23:19.633 --> 00:23:20.534
Sir.

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:25.472
- <i>Trash goes in the trash can</i>
- Sir.

00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:26.406
No.

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.409
Sir.

00:23:30.177 --> 00:23:31.311
Sir.

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:39.019
Please. Why is this happening?

00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:50.430
(Report to the police!)

00:23:59.173 --> 00:24:01.875
(Let's win first place
in the talent show.)

00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.076
(Tango is all about momentum.)

00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:05.846
Date plan.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.447
Go see the horses.

00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:08.849
Don't let go of her hand even if it's hot.

00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:12.186
Ha Ri's recent
favorite ice cream, Bbababang.

00:24:12.686 --> 00:24:13.654
Vanilla flavor.

00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:27.234
Watch out for sweaty hands.
Ha Ri hates it.

00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:42.249
Kang Dong Gu, your palms sweat like crazy.

00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.152
See you later, love you.

00:24:51.725 --> 00:24:54.061
Ha Ri is the leader, I'm the sidekick.

00:24:59.399 --> 00:25:01.301
No, Dong Gu.

00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:03.637
Dong Gu, no. Keep going.

00:25:04.104 --> 00:25:06.707
This wasn't in my plan.

00:25:06.707 --> 00:25:08.442
We were supposed to bike to a sunset spot.

00:25:13.347 --> 00:25:14.481
- Ha Ri.
- Yeah?

00:25:20.754 --> 00:25:22.890
How beautiful.

00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:25.692
So beautiful.

00:25:29.496 --> 00:25:30.931
How is that even possible?

00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:32.299
Whatever the plan is,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.135
no matter how much of a mess it is,

00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:37.371
I'll make it happen for you.

00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:39.373
If you're the leader,

00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:41.475
I'm your sidekick.

00:25:47.014 --> 00:25:47.948
I can't breathe.

00:25:47.948 --> 00:25:49.149
I love you.

00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:02.596
What do you think?
Should we just get married too?

00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:06.133
I'll think about it
when I become Assistant Manager Yoon.

00:26:09.603 --> 00:26:10.771
Dong Gu's goal.

00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:13.407
Propose to Assistant Manager Yoon.

00:26:14.341 --> 00:26:17.311
That idiot.
When did he write all this down?

00:26:17.578 --> 00:26:18.912
Things even I've forgotten.

00:26:21.215 --> 00:26:22.816
How annoying.

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:27.354
All right. Let's do this.

00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:30.257
You think I'm just going
to die nicely for you?

00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:31.925
You're dead.

00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:34.394
Even that last front tooth of his, I'll...

00:26:35.662 --> 00:26:36.396
What?

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.298
He'll get caught any second.

00:26:38.632 --> 00:26:39.933
That's him.

00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:41.068
Yeah, that bastard.

00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:08.595
Dong Gu.

00:27:09.663 --> 00:27:10.764
I'm coming.

00:27:17.471 --> 00:27:19.907
I was going to go myself,
but you came to me on your own.

00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:22.142
I thought you looked familiar.

00:27:23.043 --> 00:27:24.978
You were on the wanted list.

00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:29.082
Sharp eyes.

00:27:30.684 --> 00:27:31.685
Exactly.

00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:35.222
Dong Gu says that I've got a great memory.

00:27:48.435 --> 00:27:49.469
(Special note, wearing a hearing aid)

00:27:51.572 --> 00:27:52.773
(Wearing a hearing aid)

00:27:59.313 --> 00:28:00.147
Die.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.616
Die, you bastard.

00:28:02.616 --> 00:28:03.684
Get away.

00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:20.634
Ha Ri.

00:28:20.934 --> 00:28:21.802
Hey.

00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:23.337
Yeah, Dong Gu.

00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:27.541
Your face is bleeding.

00:28:27.808 --> 00:28:29.476
This isn't my blood.

00:28:29.476 --> 00:28:30.410
What?

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.045
Who's worrying about who right now?

00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:33.914
You look totally...

00:28:34.648 --> 00:28:35.616
Ugly?

00:28:37.518 --> 00:28:38.485
Handsome.

00:28:38.986 --> 00:28:39.987
It's thrilling.

00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:45.526
Are you okay?

00:28:46.527 --> 00:28:47.628
Does it hurt?

00:28:47.628 --> 00:28:48.695
That son of a bitch.

00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:51.565
Get up. Can you get up?

00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:53.734
Careful.

00:28:56.503 --> 00:28:57.437
Are you okay?

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:01.742
Are you a zombie now or what?

00:29:04.178 --> 00:29:06.413
You're not going anywhere, you bastards.

00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:12.319
Dong Gu.

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:13.420
Yeah?

00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:15.556
Do you know why we messed up our dance?

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:19.426
What?

00:29:21.528 --> 00:29:22.763
Because I didn't trust you.

00:29:25.132 --> 00:29:26.366
You never changed,

00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:30.037
but I doubted you.
That's why we messed up.

00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:33.574
I was the one who hit that damn slump,
not you.

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:36.743
I'm sorry.

00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:39.379
But still, Dong Gu,

00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:42.449
if you trust me,

00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:44.952
that bastard too, and our damn slump,

00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.486
I don't think I'll be scared of any of it.

00:29:49.656 --> 00:29:50.858
Will you trust me?

00:29:53.894 --> 00:29:54.828
Of course.

00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:04.037
Look at these idiots.

00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:30.130
Now I get the rule of the dance we do.

00:30:42.442 --> 00:30:43.610
Even if the steps get tangled,

00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:48.448
even if you miss the beat...

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:50.684
One.

00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:52.252
Two.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.188
Three.

00:31:10.103 --> 00:31:11.672
As long as I don't forget you
in front of me,

00:31:13.307 --> 00:31:14.374
the dance goes on.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:26.520
Hey, show me your teeth.

00:31:27.087 --> 00:31:28.789
You picked the wrong people,
don't you think?

00:31:30.357 --> 00:31:31.692
You.

00:31:32.192 --> 00:31:33.994
- You.
- You.

00:31:33.994 --> 00:31:34.895
Hit him one more time.

00:31:35.829 --> 00:31:38.866
(Love Hotel)

00:31:40.434 --> 00:31:43.136
We are at a motel
on the outskirts of Gyeonggi-do.

00:31:43.136 --> 00:31:46.073
Lee Gyu Han,
a serial killer on the wanted list,

00:31:46.073 --> 00:31:47.541
was arrested here by police...

00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:50.244
at around 7 a.m. this morning.

00:31:50.244 --> 00:31:52.179
After occupying this motel,

00:31:52.179 --> 00:31:54.748
Lee went on a rampage,
including attempted murder,

00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:56.917
leaving three with minor injuries
and one seriously injured,

00:31:56.917 --> 00:31:58.051
but fortunately, officials say...

00:31:58.051 --> 00:32:00.888
- the victims' lives are not in danger.
- Dong Gu.

00:32:00.888 --> 00:32:02.222
Are you still curious about me?

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.025
Being with you...

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:08.295
is the most thrilling thing in the world.

00:32:28.982 --> 00:32:30.982
