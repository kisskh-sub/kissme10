[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.660
[Episode 18]

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.790
More importantly,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.640
we need to find a reliable repair factory

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040
that can handle this job.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.970
Zhao!

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.760
Zhao!

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.250
Didn't I send you home?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.210
Why are you back again?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.090
I found a solution.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.820
Come with me.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.120
How did you get here so quickly?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.079
Seventh Day.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.079
Let me introduce someone to you.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:26.760
Mr. Ren.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.079
This is Mr. Ren Guodong,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.730
the chief engineer at my dad's factory.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.540
Mu told me you want to restore your car.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.570
Why don't you two have a good talk?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.320
Uncle Ren.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.230
I was wondering who Seventh Day

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.510
Pan mentioned was.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.740
Turns out it's you.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.010
You brat,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250
you really won't give up
until you hit a dead end.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.170
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.430
Come in and let's talk.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.280
Wait for me.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.340
We need to replace this part here.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.520
See? The front left longitudinal rail

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.200
is bent.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.170
And the water pump drive system
has failed too.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.800
This

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.480
is quite tricky.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.890
There are quite a few parts
that need replacing,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.300
including the connecting rod bearings.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
-How is it?
-Let's do it step by step.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.250
What do you think?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.340
How did the talk go?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.620
Let's go home first.
I'll explain it to you then.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.370
I'm leaving. Thanks.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.940
Does your dad know

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.520
they're fixing the car here?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.490
Mu, you're here.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.640
Of course he does.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.260
How did you tell him?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.760
Right after you called me,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.930
I told my dad right away.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.960
I said if he didn't help me,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.130
I might fail the college entrance exam
again this year.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.660
So you threatened your dad?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.340
I'm his only son anyway,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.590
and he wouldn't dare upset me right now.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.190
What if I pull out his oxygen tube
when he's old?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.520
About this matter of Seventh Day, I...

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.650
Don't call him that.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.870
Just call him Brandy.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.600
Nobody calls him that anymore.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.810
I told my dad

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.190
about Brandy's situation.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.640
I thought he wouldn't agree,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.050
but he actually did.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.570
He even assigned Mr. Ren to help me

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.810
and let me clear out some space
in the warehouse.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.000
He's just pretending
he doesn't know anything.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.320
Later I asked my mom to feel him out,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.930
and that's when I found out Brandy

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.450
has a personal feud

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.790
with the owner of Wan.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.010
Your dad knows that, yet he still helped.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.540
He really is a businessman
with a conscience.

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.370
Then I'm the son of a businessman
with a conscience.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.200
Thank you, son of a businessman
with a conscience.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.159
Study hard this year.

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:58.690
I hope you get into college.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.540
Wish me luck.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.430
I'll try my best.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.960
Food's here.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.450
Sanlai, why are you here?

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.080
I'm here to bring food
for the little princess.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.380
Take a break, Iron Cock!

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.610
Come on, Yang, time to eat.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.409
Coming!

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.060
Zhao, time to eat.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.010
Coming, Sanlai.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.570
Here.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.740
What food do we have today?

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.740
See for yourself.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.400
You're truly a dedicated
logistics manager.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.410
Here.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.330
Eat up.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.320
Sit down.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.930
Thanks.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.990
Pan Kai.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.810
Stop studying. Time to eat.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.900
Coming, Sanlai.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.890
Are you tired?

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.020
Thanks.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.840
After dinner,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.390
please take Mu home for me.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.800
No problem.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.750
Sir,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.159
this question is

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.890
(P²)/(2m).

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.240
Okay, thank you, sir.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.900
Zhao.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.800
Thank you.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.270
I'll remember this favor

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.760
and repay it someday.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.560
It's nothing.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.410
Just a small gesture.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.900
I'll be the one to repay you,

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.720
not her.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.010
I wouldn't dare let her.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.940
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.220
I just want to go in
and grab a bottle of water.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.700
Water?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.620
Do you want one?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.340
I'll take one.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.120
Okay.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.640
The car is over there.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.500
Brandy.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.980
What's wrong?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.520
Mu has already been sent home.
Don't worry.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.360
Forget it. Just focus on fixing your car.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.420
I'm hanging up now.

I brought some
late-night snacks for you all.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.490
Come and eat.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.410
-Thank you, Mu.
-Thank you, Mu.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:42.800
Thanks, Mu.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.560
Thank you.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.170
I'm going out for some fresh air.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.640
Let's sit down and eat.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.560
Yes, yes.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.490
You did that on purpose.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.700
You couldn't find me

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.980
and got worried?

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.330
I came to see Pan Kai.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.340
Say that again.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.360
Well, finding Sanlai would be fine too.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.960
After his recent haircut,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.700
he looks more attractive to me.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.130
So I'm not attractive to you anymore?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.530
I wouldn't dare say that.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.610
Let me ask you something.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.700
Would you be willing
to go back to Nanjing with me?

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.630
When we're in Nanjing,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.890
if you want to run a garage,

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.090
I'll do it with you.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.640
If not,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.020
we can open a coffee shop together.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.440
Why a coffee shop?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.330
I just feel it would be nice

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.730
for us to open a coffee shop together.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.800
We must choose a location at the foot
of a mountain with phoenix trees.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.970
In autumn,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.470
the golden leaves of phoenix trees
would cover the ground,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.280
and Lightning would run back and forth
over them.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.610
How happy that would be.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.090
Give me a few days.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.330
I'll give you an answer.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.280
Sorry

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.600
I can't spend much time with you.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.570
It's the final stage.
I'll be working late.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.660
Will you be angry?

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.410
Mu?

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.370
Brandy?

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.410
You... you two...

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.310
Aren't you two related?

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.410

I've always wanted to ask—

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.240
why are your shoelaces always untied?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.640
I'm afraid that if I squat down
and tie them,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.980

whether my laces are tied or not.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.030
If your shoelaces come undone,

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.030
you must fix them.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.850

Who are they?

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.490
Not many people in Manshi
would lend him money.
