WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.036
[♪ opening theme music playing]

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.394
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.897
Jimin, wait for me.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.434
THEY START DAY 2 IN SWITZERLAND
WITH WATER SPORTS

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.069
Loads of shallots.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:39.406
TODAY, I'M THE CHEF

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.308
ENJOYING JUNG KOOK'S COOKING

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.277
JIMIN'S HEARTY APPETITE

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.579
FEELING PROUD WATCHING HIM EAT SO WELL

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.881
A YUTNORI MATCH AGAINST THE STAFF

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.783
CALLING HIMSELF YUT GOD

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.653
MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.087
Do, we need a Do.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.155
Oh!

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.824
YUT GOD JIMIN BLESSES THE GAME

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.693
EARNS ALLOWANCE WITH EASE

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.528
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.531
ENDING THE DAY FEELING GREAT

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.568
ON DAY 3 IN SWITZERLAND,
THEY GO TO FURKA PASS

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.872
EXCHANGING GREETINGS WITH SOME COOL RIDERS

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.274
UNFORGETTABLE MEMORIES MADE

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:17.010
BUT THE JOY IS SHORT-LIVED...
TRAIN IS ABOUT TO LEAVE

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.078
Let's go.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.714
BARELY MADE IT IN TIME

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.082
Where's our destination?

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.217
THE SECOND STOP OF THEIR TRIP

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.687
ZERMATT, THE MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS' PARADISE

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:32.259
ANOTHER EATING BINGE IN THE SECOND TOWN

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.362
[Jung Kook] Jimin really enjoyed that.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.197
THEIR TRIP IN ZERMATT BEGINS NOW

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.133
WALKING TO THEIR LODGING
TO WALK THE MEAL OFF

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.268
I'm so full.

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.237
After eating...

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.207
Ugh.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.347
The breeze feels so nice.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.217
THE NIGHT IS JUST PERFECT

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.552
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.191
I don't know if it's because
of the buildings and all that,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:08.895
but even though there aren't many people,
it feels kind of festive.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.899
[Jimin sighs]

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.267
The night feels so good.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.836
I love the night here.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:18.939
I feel really good.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.476
Don't you think going over there
would be healing?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.678
I'll pass by there.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.381
I need to recharge my energy.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:28.882
Me too.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.684
-[in English] Heal.
-[in English] Heal.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:32.619
Heal.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.954
ENERGY FULLY RECHARGED

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.256
-[in Korean] Energy restored.
-[in Korean] Yeah.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.426
-This is nice.
-Right?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.161
Why is everything so colorful?

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:42.596
Right now...

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.338
But, seriously,
this place is so beautiful.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.741
It just has a vibe
that makes you feel good.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:59.546
If I ever come on a personal trip
next time,

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.281
I think I'd come here.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.752
Yeah. I actually looked up places
a few days ago.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.522
-Yeah.
-It kept showing up as a must-visit spot.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.691
It's beautiful. Worth the trip.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.994
The lighting at this hour is just perfect.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.863
And not too crowded.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.334
[both sniffing]

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.537
-Love it. Right.
-Smells like night air.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:25.806
The scent of grass.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.211
[Jung Kook] We're here?
Wish we'd walked 10 more minutes.

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.013
-Way closer than I thought.
-Yes.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:36.983
[in English] Yes.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.519
-By the way...
-Yes.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.321
I feel hot now.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.623
-Huh?
-I feel hot.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.992
I'm heading to the balcony.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.361
-[in Korean] The balcony? Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.463
Let's go!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.368
Wow, this is...

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.438
-It's nice!
-Right?

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:01.174
Can the camera capture this?
I should rotate it a bit.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.979
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK'S POV

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.049
Whoa.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:10.350
[Jung Kook] This is insane.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.119
Can pictures even capture this?

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:16.256
[Jimin] Honestly, I don't think
even this video captures it.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:22.662
Yeah, that's similar to the view
we're seeing right now.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.533
But it looks a bit darker on camera.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.936
Man, this is truly incredible.

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:31.772
[camera shutter clicking]

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.879
It only captures my face.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.814
HIS FEATURES STEAL THE SCENE

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.185
-Wow, this is absolutely breathtaking.
-Totally.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.720
DIFFERENT FROM THE DAY

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.290
[Jung Kook] But it never looks quite
as good as it does in person.

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:53.026
-[Jimin] Yeah, this place especially.
-Right.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.095
Actually, you know...

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:56.863
On camera,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.900
it might look like
just grass and mountains.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.736
-But seeing it feels totally different.
-Yeah.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.204
-[Jung Kook] Stunning.
-Yeah.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.672
[Jung Kook] Totally different.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.408
But you know what I think?

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:12.145
To be honest,
things here are pretty pricey,

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:15.182
but I think you're definitely paying
for the view.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.249
-For the view?
-Yeah.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.120
-They've preserved nature so well.
-Right.

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:21.788
Take another look.

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.356
Keep looking, enjoy it.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.791
[laughs]

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.661
[Jung Kook] Wow,
Switzerland is really beautiful.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.629
[Jimin] Glad we came here.

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.068
THEY SPEND A LONG TIME
JUST ENJOYING THE VIEW

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:37.037
-[Jimin] Should we call him?
-Yeah.

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:39.739
[Jimin] Still working, huh?

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.509
-You're in Switzerland, right?
-[man on phone] Yeah.

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:43.977
I'm in Switzerland, too.

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.813
Think we'll get to see each other
before you leave?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.648
I'm heading to Paris tomorrow.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.483
Oh, so we won't be able to meet.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.286
Would've been so much more fun
if you were here.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.122
You kept telling me
about Switzerland, remember?

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.024
That it was beautiful and I had to come.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.760
-Isn't it nice here?
-It's amazing.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.196
But you came during winter, right?

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.966
Yeah, it was winter.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.802
Now that I'm here,
I want to visit in winter, too.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.405
Yeah, but if you come in winter,
you'll have to shovel snow.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.841
WINTER MEANS SNOW SHOVELING

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.643
Okay, fair point.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.678
I mean, summer's the right season.

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.313
[Jimin laughing]

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.551
Yeah, summer's perfect.

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.620
Listen. I'm sorry, but...

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:29.256
-Can you say a word to the viewers?
-Dear viewers...

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.224
Dear viewers...

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.626
TO. OUR VIEWERS

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:33.727
...are you sure?!

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:36.930
I'm sure.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.033
Yeah, we were thinking the same.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.036
All right. Have fun and get home safely.

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.338
Jung Kook says bye, too.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.673
Take care.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:50.911
AFTER A SHORT CALL WITH RM

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.713
[Jimin] What should we do now? Dance?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.715
LEARNING THE "KILLIN' IT GIRL" CHALLENGE

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.218
Should we have another glass of wine?

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.186
Or should we practice?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.588
Go ahead if you want.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.024
-What?
-I'm already feeling just right.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.592
NOT WHAT HE WANTED

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:06.660
Practice?

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:07.928
Do whatever you want.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.696
I kind of want to do both.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:10.964
Rock-paper-scissors?

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:12.499
If you win, we'll drink wine.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.034
-Wine?
-Just one glass.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.704
If I win, we'll practice a bit
and go to bed.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:18.838
Okay.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.241
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.477
Guess we're practicing.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:27.347
CRASH COURSE
FOR THE "KILLIN' IT GIRL" CHALLENGE

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:30.150
Step right, left, right,
left, right, left.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.752
Right-left-right, left-right-left.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.321
One, two, and...

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.592
[indistinct conversation]

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.361
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.330
Harder than I thought.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.564
[singing indistinctly]

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:50.036
PERFECTION LEVEL

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:59.312
ENDLESS REPETITION IN THE SAME SPOT

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.748
NAILING EVERY DETAIL PRECISELY

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.250
-Smoothly?
-Just like this.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:05.752
Yes.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.593
[singing indistinctly]

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:18.765
PRACTICE OVER

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.833
Good.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.534
-Good work.
-You too.

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:30.143
PRACTICING EVEN WHILE BRUSHING TEETH

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.115
JUNG KOOK ALSO WATCHES J-HOPE'S VIDEO
WHILE BRUSHING TEETH

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.250
So cool.

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:38.551
A SHOUT-OUT TO J-HOPE

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.856
JIMIN DROPS BY TO SAY GOODNIGHT

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.158
-I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.360
-Good night.
-Good night.

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:49.462
-Good work today.
-Yeah.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:55.368
JIMIN IS ON THE PHONE
BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:03.410
DREAMLAND

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.249
JUNG KOOK IN DREAMLAND TOO

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.151
[AI] Do you speak Korean?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.187
[in English] Yeah, I speak Korean.

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.522
LEARNING NEVER ENDS

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.525
[AI] You speak Korean,
and I speak English.

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.261
Well, bye.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.163
Why bye?

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.334
[in Korean] What the heck?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.837
Why bye?

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:33.540
SUMMONED RIGHT BACK

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.375
-[AI] Hello.
-[in English] Hello.

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:36.709
[AI] Do you like tea?

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.012
I like tea.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.081
[AI] I like tea, too.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.483
Do you like pizza?

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:45.819
I like pizza.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.921
[AI] Well, bye.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.189
AGAIN?

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.625
I don't wanna... go.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.794
[AI] See you later.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:58.331
STRONGLY COMPLAINING

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.000
[in Korean] I don't want to sleep yet.

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.169
Why are you ending it?

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.839
How rude.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.408
[continues practicing English]

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:15.115
JUNG KOOK SPENT QUITE A WHILE
STUDYING ENGLISH

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:21.020
GETTING SLEEPY...
THE REST CAN WAIT TILL TOMORROW

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.993
AFTER A DAY FILLED WITH PURE JOY

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.598
MORNING COMES WITH THE SOUND OF BIRDS
AND RUNNING WATER

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:36.069
A FRESH MORNING IN ZERMATT BEGINS

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.539

-Really?
-[staff] Yes.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.842
[groaning]

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.877
Do we have

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.447
-paragliding today?
-[staff] That's right.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.715
[groans]

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:27.420
EXCUSE ME?

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:32.125
SECOND WAKE-UP MISSION COMPLETE

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.260
-[staff] Come on out.
-Okay.

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:39.265
STAFF RETREATS
AFTER ACCOMPLISHING THE MISSION

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.504
Let's go!

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:51.377
STROLLING ABOUT

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:55.014
SCANNING THE MENU QUICKLY FIRST

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:59.352
WHILE JUNG KOOK SETS UP BREAKFAST

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:01.921
JIMIN, OF COURSE, IS STILL FAST ASLEEP

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:07.460
SUDDENLY JUMPS UP

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:10.330
APPEARS IN A BOLD OOTD

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.300
Why do I feel so tired?

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:15.835
Huh?

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.070
Your heart's racing?

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.473
STARTING THE DAY WITH A GLASS OF MILK
INSTEAD OF COFFEE

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.143
JIMIN ENJOYING A LIGHT BREAKFAST

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.247
THE BIG EATER SLOWLY WARMING UP

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.582

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.335
Where is it? Over here?

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.137
Where is it? Over here?

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:52.205
TAKES A BITE

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.640
Gotta have another one.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.908
Shall we get ready?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.711
Why is that on your head?

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.513
My hair's too puffy.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.581
FLUFFY HAIR

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:03.516
So you do care about your looks, huh?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.251
No?

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.288
Guess I haven't completely given up yet.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.024
I lost my faith now.

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:13.493
-What?
-There's more food.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.962
-Oh, there was a croissant, too.
-Right.

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:18.698
BIG EATER'S BREAKFAST LIST
5: CROISSANT

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:21.000
I just can't resist croissants.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.071
Mmm!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.139
Good?

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.208
EATING SO WELL

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.977
Could you spread some for me?

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.314
KEEPS SLIPPING AWAY

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.549
Why does it keep slipping
when it's for you?

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:37.817
[both laugh]

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:41.721
I was actually being serious this time.

00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:44.223
-Isn't that how you really feel?
-No.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.291
No?

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:46.793
No.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.028
CROISSANT ASMR

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:50.096
It's crunchy, right?

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:53.366
Tastes good, huh?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.337
We really need to get ready. Oh boy.

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.373
DOING THE OPPOSITE

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.609
This one's blueberry jam.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.979
DOWNING THE LAST GLASS OF MILK

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:11.284
WRAPPING UP WITH A BLUEBERRY JAM CROISSANT

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:14.487
We don't have much time. Hurry!

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:19.225
AFTER A SOLID BREAKFAST,
IT'S TIME TO GET READY

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:22.595
-Jimin! Let's go.
-Yes.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.598
TODAY'S PLAN:
KICKBIKE, HIKING

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.101
PARAGLIDING, DINNER,
VISITING A PUB

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.136
HEADING OUT TO RIDE THE KICKBIKES

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.204
It's automatic.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.739
Let's get in.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.144
A mini bus.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.980
THIS ELECTRIC TAXI THEY'RE RIDING NOW

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.550
IS PART OF THE ECO-FRIENDLY
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN ZERMATT

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.786
A CLEAN VILLAGE SURROUNDED BY MATTERHORN

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:49.722
WHERE INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES
ARE BANNED TO PROTECT NATURE

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.759
How long?

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.761
How long does it take?

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:58.931
Wow.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:02.535
-About six minutes from here.
-Six minutes?

00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:03.636
That's so close.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.238
Really strong today.

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:07.440
Well?

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:09.742
The sun's really strong.

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.414
Looks like we're here.

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.184
SUNNEGGA EXPRESS STATION

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:19.585
FROM ZERMATT TO THE VIEWPOINT

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.087
1,545 METERS, 32.5-DEGREE SLOPE

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:22.488
REACHES THE TOP IN THREE MINS

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.157
BOARDING THE FUNICULAR

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.058
It'll be so much fun if it goes up fast.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.828
Then I'm just gonna lie down.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:34.066
Feels like riding a subway
that's on a steep diagonal.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:36.869
If I go like this...

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:40.106
TRYING TO BALANCE HIS OWN HORIZON

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:41.407
Now it looks straight.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:45.611
JUNG KOOK WANTS TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.814
It's really fast.

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.982
It feels strange.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:53.486
As we go up, it's like being sucked
into another dimension.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:54.987
The train just...

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.255
[imitates whooshing]

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.858
Like we're traveling to another world.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.426
[Jung Kook] Almost there.

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:02.595
ARRIVED AT THE VIEWPOINT

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.564
[Jung Kook] Hey, we saw
it yesterday, but...

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.934
[crew] They say it's actually rare
to get such a clear view.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.001
[Jung Kook] Really?

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.471
-[Jimin] Gotta come when nice out.
-Gotta take a pic.

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:12.972
THE MATTERHORN: 4,478 METERS

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.373
GRAND PYRAMID-SHAPED PEAK

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.908
MOST ICONIC MOUNTAIN

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.244
People visit to see
how sharply it's carved.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.312
Like that?

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.080
All made by nature.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.783
And I saw in some photos, at sunset,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.520
one side, not the whole thing,
just this section here...

00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.355
-Like this?
-Yeah, just that part.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.558
-[Jimin] Only that area turns orange.
-It must look beautiful.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.261
[Jimin] A lot of people come here
to take pictures of it.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.329
[Jung Kook] Really?

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.431
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.499
Come here.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.868
TAKING A PHOTO WITH THE MATTERHORN

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:42.935
Best shot...

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.872
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Looks great.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.139
Should I take one for you?

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.809
-Want me to take one for you?
-Yes.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:53.312
Is this right?

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.547
[Jung Kook] One second.

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.482
-Let me frame it.
-[Jimin laughing]

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.150
-Over here?
-No.

00:16:58.651 --> 00:16:59.785
Here?

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:00.987
Hold on, hold on.

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:02.989
HIDDEN EFFORTS BEHIND THE PERFECT SHOT

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.925
PHOTO CHECK TIME

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:08.561
[camera shutter clicking]

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.330
OFF TO RIDE KICKBIKES

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.999
[Jimin] There are no seats, right?

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.200
It's a kickbike.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.768
So it's not an electric one.

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:17.837
[Jung Kook] Yeah. Just a downhill ride.

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:20.540
PUTTING ON SAFETY GEAR

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.774
Fully secured.

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:23.009
IRONCLAD PROTECTION

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:26.312
JIMIN PUTS ON A HELMET TOO

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.581
With this helmet and all,

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:30.550
I can block the sunlight better.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:32.485
SUNNEGGA TO ZERMATT

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.153
Jung Kook, do you want to go first?

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.155
-Me?
-I can't go fast.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.290
Okay.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:41.661
SWITCHING ORDER FOR HIM

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.029
If you fall here, that's it.

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.230
Let's be careful.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:51.337
JUNG KOOK SLOWLY PICKING UP SPEED

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:55.775
RIDING DOWN WITH THE MATTERHORN IN SIGHT

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:59.979
MEANWHILE, SOMEONE'S STILL
GETTING USED TO IT

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:01.047
[exclaiming]

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.982
WOBBLES AT EVERY LITTLE ROCK

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:04.917
Why is there a rock?

00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:07.820
GRUNTING

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.356
Going down too fast.

00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:12.525
[chuckles]

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:18.064
MEANWHILE, SOMEONE'S FULLY ENJOYING
THE OFF-ROAD RIDE

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.835
SPEED RACER GONE WILD

00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:26.005
PURE HAPPINESS

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:28.841
END OF DOWNHILL SECTION

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:31.077
ENTERING THE FLAT COURSE

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.578
Gotta use my left leg, too.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:38.618
KICKING WITH BOTH LEGS
HE'S TRYING HARD, BUT...

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:40.886
This is tiring.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.589
JIMIN ENTERS THE FLAT COURSE TOO

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.825
[Jimin grunting]

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:47.760
Riding it like an actual scooter.

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:51.430
Scooter, scooter.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:56.102
NOT A KICKBIKE
A SCOOTER

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:59.005
You have to kick way more than I thought.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:00.072
Exactly.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.275
[Jimin] Oh, doing it
like this feels faster.

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:04.343
Maybe not?

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:07.313
It'd be nice if there were
more downhill slopes.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.914
Where are the downhills?

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.317
Give me a downhill slope, please.

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.521
FINALLY...

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:19.291
DOWNHILL COURSE BEGINS AGAIN

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:24.263
FEELING THE SPEED WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.666
HAPPINESS RESUMES

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:29.969
AND SO DOES THE STRUGGLE

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.305
JUNG KOOK SUDDENLY STOPS

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.174
Why?

00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:36.776
So I can go even faster.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.278
A STEP BACK FOR A FASTER LEAP FORWARD

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.519
CHARGING UP HIS SPEED ENERGY
AND GO!

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:49.321
Whoa!

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.057
This is too fast.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:52.958
Ahh!

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.064
MAKES STRANGE NOISES AS HE ZOOMS PAST

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.632
SHOUTING

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.603
HEHE, THIS IS FUN

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.942
STOPS TO CHECK WHERE JIMIN IS

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:15.915
It shakes too much.
It keeps flipping backwards.

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:20.119
FIXING IT UP TO SECURE HIS SOLO SHOT

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.187
Shall we go?

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:25.591
BACK TO SQUARE ONE IN FIVE SECONDS

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.727
MERCILESS OFF-ROAD TERRAIN

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:31.564
GRUNTING

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:37.169
AFTER LETTING JIMIN GO FIRST,
HE STARTS HIS 2ND PURSUIT

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.637
[whooping]

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.109
Too fast.

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:52.051
OVERTAKES AGAIN AT INSANE SPEED

00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:54.787
SAME KICKBIKE, TOTALLY DIFFERENT PACE

00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.856
[Jung Kook] I should wait
until he's farther.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.159
CALCULATING TIMING FOR MAXIMUM DOPAMINE

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:01.660
This is so fun. So fun.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.898
UNAWARE OF WHAT'S COMING NEXT

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.601
THE CHEERFUL LITTLE LAMB

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:13.472
CLOSING IN ON HIM

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:15.541
THE CHASER

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:18.544
AND THE ONE BEING CHASED

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:25.484
ENDING JUST AS EXPECTED

00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:28.554
A KICKBIKE TURNS INTO A QUICKBIKE

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:30.856
He's crazy.

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:32.858
That was fun.

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.961
Yeah, drift.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.196
Like this...

00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:39.632
-That's how you do it.
-Wow, you're even drifting?

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:43.669
INSTANTLY TRIES TO COPY

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:46.038
HIS MOVES GETTING FLASHIER

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:47.206
Like this...

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.475
Drifting is really fun.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:57.983
KICKBIKE SKILL MASTER

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:02.221
-Drifting is so fun.
-Right?

00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:04.056
It actually feels kind of nice.

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:05.724
It's fun.

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:09.161
-[Jung Kook] Let's slow down a bit.
-[in English] Okay.

00:22:12.932 --> 00:22:15.134
I was going down like "Eh?"
And you were like...

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:16.669
GRUNTING

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.639
IT'S STILL SO FUNNY

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:23.042
[Jung Kook] Why were you
screaming on the way down?

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:27.346
-There were so many rocks earlier.
-Yes.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:29.815
That's why.

00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:31.951
Then why were you doing that?

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:35.421
Sounds like a grandpa.

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:39.291
TOGETHER

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:40.359
Me too.

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:42.561
ENCORE

00:22:42.628 --> 00:22:44.496
[Jung Kook] Going down slowly
is fun, too.

00:22:44.597 --> 00:22:45.598
[Jimin] Yeah, not bad.

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:48.400
-[Jung Kook] While talking.
-You know, it could be dangerous,

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:50.703
-but also really safe.
-Right.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.839
[Jung Kook] The buildings are beautiful.
I never get tired of them.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.007
HAPPINESS FILLS UP

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.843
We're almost there.

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.412
Do people usually grab a coffee here?

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:07.219
I know this is the center spot.

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.754
My eyes are probably the center.

00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:10.189
The center of the frame.

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:11.624
SCRATCHES HEAD

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.058
Or maybe not.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:15.594
-You're right.
-It's kind of iffy.

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.198
We can see it better from here.
Why does it look even bigger?

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:22.368
See that? The waterfall.

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.503
-That small one over there.
-Yeah.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.406
-It looks slow, but it's super-fast.
-I know.

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.775
-You know it's no joke.
-I know.

00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:32.978
-You know it's huge, right?
-I know.

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:36.515
If you stand under that...
It's like martial arts training.

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.385
It splits into two streams.
One for each of us?

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.087
-Around there? Down below?
-Yeah.

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:43.656
-Like martial arts.
-Yeah.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.424
-Like martial arts training?
-Yeah.

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:47.660
[Jimin] If that's
how I can get stronger, sure.

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:50.362
You know, the Matterhorn,

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:53.065
I wonder how big it would look up close.

00:23:53.132 --> 00:23:54.433
That? Not that big.

00:23:56.035 --> 00:23:58.570
But you said that stream would be massive.

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.372
That mountain's way farther away.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.409
-If you stood right between those spots...
-Yeah.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.144
I bet you wouldn't even be visible.

00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.913
-Even if you jumped.
-Of course not.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.015
[Jung Kook] Totally invisible.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.889
-I took a very special photo.
-What?

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:19.358
Nothing special?

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:23.662
THE MATTERHORN'S NOTHING SPECIAL

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.197
-Jimin.
-Thank you.

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.700
-Jimin, I hurt my shin.
-Just now?

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:28.834
[groans]

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:30.102
It's bleeding.

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:31.170
-Not much.
-[man] How?

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:32.771
That shin bump...

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.573
-[man] From earlier?
-Yeah, yeah.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.141
It's nothing.

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.409
It's kind of cute.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.711
Just dust.

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.079
SHAKES OFF LIKE DUST

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.815
-[Jung Kook] Jimin, shall we head back?
-Sure, sounds good.

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.049
[Jung Kook] That was fun.

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:45.884
HEADING BACK TO THE HOTEL

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.619
[sighs in relief]

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.522
BACK TO THEIR SWEET LODGING

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:51.590
Two, three.

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:53.926
I'll get some rest now.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:54.994
Lie down.

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:59.465
AS TOLD, JUNG KOOK LIES DOWN

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.335
Jung Kook disappeared.

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.009
WHILE JIMIN SITS AND RESTS ON THE COUCH

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:13.178
JUNG KOOK SLIPS BACK INTO THE ROOM

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.781
JIMIN GOES TO FIND HIM

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:20.853
BUT HE'S NOT IN THE ROOM

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.990
MAYBE HERE?

00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:31.330
JUNG KOOK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:35.801
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR HIS YOUNGER MEMBER

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:40.172
JUNG KOOK HAS DISAPPEARED

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.242
A VOICE HEARD FROM SOMEWHERE

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.812
[whispering] Jimin is looking for me
right now.

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:50.082
But...

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:52.284
I'm in another room.

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.153
[chuckles]

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.856
Will Jimin be able to find me?

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:59.058
Or not?

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.326
Where could I be?

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:09.802
2X SPEED

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.670
[Jimin] Jung Kook disappeared.

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.873
[Jung Kook] I disappeared, apparently.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.375
[man] Where did he go?

00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:18.110
[Jimin] Here? No?

00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:19.978
[man] Probably not here.
In my room?

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:21.280
[Jimin] He's not here?

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:23.182
-Why would he be in my room?
-He's not?

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.883
[man] What? He's here.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.518
-He really was here.
-[laughing]

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:27.820
JUNG KOOK HAS BEEN FOUND

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:30.589
CAUGHT HIDING IN THE STAFF'S ROOM

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.325
Could've lasted a bit longer.

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:38.430
Maybe I'll take a nap here.

00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:41.366
AFTER A CUTE PRANK

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.236
JUNG KOOK SLOWLY DRIFTS OFF TO SLEEP

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:46.905
[man] We'll leave in about 40 minutes.

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:47.973
[Jimin] Okay.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.643
JIMIN TAKES A REST TOO

00:26:52.211 --> 00:26:53.745
RECHARGING ENERGY

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.482
FOR THEIR NEXT ACTIVITY

00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:59.618
SHAKING OFF THE KICKBIKE FATIGUE
WITH A NAP

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.688
TIME TO GO PARAGLIDING

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:04.556
-Wait, we have to run?
-Yeah.

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:05.757
We got to run.

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:08.627
CAMERA IN A RUSH

00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:10.095
Big step. One.

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:12.431
One, two.

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:13.932
[Jung Kook] Walk, walk.

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.634
QUICKLY HOPPING INTO A TAXI

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:18.437
We're always running late
when we have a train to catch.

00:27:18.504 --> 00:27:20.105
It's been quite the spectacle.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.040
Is it just me?

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.511
Until the train leaves?

00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.013
THREE MINUTES LEFT UNTIL TRAIN LEAVES

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.915
GORNERGRAT RAILWAY STATION

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:31.083
Are we going to make it?

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:35.187
EYES FILLED WITH ANXIETY

00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:36.555
[man in English] Here, here.

00:27:36.622 --> 00:27:38.223
[in Korean] Grab the camera.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.625
[Jimin in English] Thank you.

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.127
RUSHING FOOTSTEPS

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:45.597
THANKFULLY, THE TRAIN'S STILL WAITING

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.668
RUN "ARE YOU SURE?!" PART 2

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:52.271
IN THE MIDST OF TOTAL CHAOS

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.940
THEY SAFELY BOARDED THE TRAIN

00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:57.643
GORNERGRAT STATION

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.710
GORNERGRAT RAILWAY

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.346
EUROPE'S HIGHEST OPEN-AIR TRAIN,
BOUND FOR THE GORNERGRAT OBSERVATORY

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.715
[in Korean] It takes about 30 minutes.

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:04.950
[Jung Kook] 30 minutes?

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.452
What a view.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.688
A VIEW WORTH SAVING

00:28:10.322 --> 00:28:11.790
Wow.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:15.694
This is nice.

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:16.862
[exclaims]

00:28:17.296 --> 00:28:18.297
The best!

00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:22.601
MEANWHILE...

00:28:22.668 --> 00:28:25.437
THIS MAN SEEMS LOST IN THE SCENERY

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.041
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY LOST IN DREAMLAND

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:33.245
FROM HIS MIRACLE MORNING

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:35.380
[grunting]

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:39.851
TO THE KICKBIKE RIDING

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:43.188
IT'S BEEN QUITE A TOUGH DAY

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:44.323
Too fast.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.759
ENDS UP DOZING OFF

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:53.498
JUNG KOOK NOTICES HIM SLEEPING

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.735
ALONE TIME #1
SHOWING OFF THE ARMY LOGO

00:28:56.802 --> 00:29:00.906

ALONE TIME #4
FILMING JIMIN SLEEPING

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:12.351
I CAN HAVE FUN ALL BY MYSELF

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:15.153
FLUSTERED

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.656
I didn't hit the record button.

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:20.292
HE'S BEEN FILMING

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:22.828
EVERYTHING FROM THE HOTEL

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.896
TO THE HECTIC TAXI RIDE

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:27.599
WITH THIS CAMERA

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:29.434
Goodness.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:32.170
FILLED WITH BITTERSWEET EMOTIONS

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.240
WHILE HE'S CLUELESSLY ASLEEP

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:38.310
HE'S GETTING BORED

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:41.680
CAPTURING HIM SLEEPING AGAIN

00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:42.881
[camera shutter clicks]

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:47.185
LAUGHING SILENTLY TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.388
-You took a photo of me again?
-Yeah.

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.023
But it's cute, isn't it?

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:55.394
Gosh, this is fun.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.129
This is the most fun.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.997
He's kind of smiling right now.

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:03.101
ALONE TIME #5
MAKING A HEART WITH JIMIN'S HAND

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.304
IT'S SO FUN

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.639
SCENERY TOO BEAUTIFUL TO MISS

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.908
Whoa.

00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:12.044
It's all open?

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:20.152
AN OPEN-AIR MOUNTAIN RAILWAY

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:23.488
THAT OFFERS A FULL VIEW OF THE MATTERHORN

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.957
By the way,
it might be cold up there, right?

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:27.592
-Up there?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.861
Probably super cool rather than cold.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.396
-I think it'll be cool.
-Yeah?

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:35.400
THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.071
HAS ALREADY CLIMBED 9.3 KILOMETERS

00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:42.574
HEADING TOWARD ITS FINAL DESTINATION

00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:44.142
[Jung Kook] They're paragliding.

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.278
[Jimin] Remember the last time
we went for it?

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:49.815
But that place wasn't as high up, right?

00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:52.084
Right?

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.553
This time,
we'll actually be flying for real.

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:56.722
ARRIVED AT ROTENBODEN STATION

00:30:57.656 --> 00:30:59.358
It's cool out here.

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.093
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.495
I just saw someone boarding the train

00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:05.897
who looked exactly
like my middle school friend.

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:07.332
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:11.903
ROTENBODEN STATION - RIFFELSEE LAKE

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:14.840
We can see snow, yet it's not cold.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:18.210
By the way, it'd be so nice to come here
for a trip like them.

00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:21.980
EVERY STEP, ANOTHER AWE

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.349
There's another lake. It's insane.

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.017
-[Jimin] Right?
-Unreal.

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:27.786
[Jimin] The whole view looks surreal.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:29.988
[Jung Kook] It's just unbelievable.

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:32.457
RIFFELSEE LAKE

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:35.327
A HIGH-ALTITUDE LAKE
REFLECTING THE MATTERHORN

00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:36.962
A MUST-SEE PHOTO SPOT

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:40.265
This is the mountain

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:43.502
leading up to the Matterhorn in Zermatt.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.437
What do they sell in Zermatt?

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.440
-Zermatt is...
-A mart.

00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:49.775
They sell beer.

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.777
And wine, too.

00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:55.947
[sighs] Jung Kook, could you move
the cloud for me?

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.183
[Jung Kook] Me? Should I photoshop it?

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.718
[Jimin] One, two, three.

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:02.988
-It was there, but now it's gone.
-[Jung Kook] It's gone.

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:06.458
CAN'T HELP BUT BE AMAZED

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:07.526
That's incredible.

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:10.162
You go first.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.229
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:12.464
THE PHOTO SPOT

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.000
I guess you take photos here.

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:17.502
Of the reflection?

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:19.404
-Yeah.
-Wow.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:22.073
[Jimin] I think you take the photo here.

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.844
LET'S ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL VIEW TOGETHER

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:28.146
It's reflecting even clearer here.

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.182
This is amazing.

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:31.716
-Let me take one for you.
-Okay.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:32.851
Jung Kook.

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:38.156
PASSIONATE

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:42.661
PERFECT SHOT WITH THE MATTERHORN

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:45.664
UNDER THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.632
A PHOTO TOGETHER

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:50.969
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:53.472
#SHOUTING FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE MATTERHORN

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.440
#GO MATTERHORN

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:58.810
[Jimin] The background
looks unreal, honestly.

00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:02.881
[Jung Kook] Feels like we're inside
a Windows wallpaper.

00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:06.284
THE MAGNIFICENCE ATTRACTS COUNTLESS PEOPLE

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.452
Shall we go?

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.753
[Jimin] Let's go.

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:11.756
Why not? There's nothing we can't do.

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:14.092
That's the Matterhorn.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.594
It's getting bigger and bigger.

00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:18.497
It's painfully beautiful.

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.833
The scenery surrounding us...

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:23.335
You know?

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.569
[chuckles]

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.238
That was kind of cute just now.

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:27.772
"You know?"

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.676
-The scenery surrounding us...
-Surrounding us...

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:32.744
-You know?
-You know?

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:34.779
[Jimin] You know?

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.481
That scared me.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.287
Going downhill is kind of tough.

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:44.389
[panting]

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.060
GOING DOWNHILL BACKWARDS

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:51.062
ONCE TO THE LEFT

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:53.465
ONCE TO THE RIGHT

00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:57.002
DOWNHILL CONQUERED

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:02.207
MARCHING IN SYNC TO THEIR USUAL RHYTHM

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:06.878
SUDDENLY, JIMIN SPRINTS ALONE

00:34:06.945 --> 00:34:09.714
SEPARATED LIKE THEY WERE EPISODE 2

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:13.251
HE WANTED TO SEE THE MATTERHORN
FROM HIGHER UP

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:18.089
IS THIS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
IN JIMIN'S EYES?

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.691
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:23.428
GETTING HYPED UP
AFTER SEEING THE MATTERHORN

00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:27.332
Oh yeah.

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.569
TAKE IN THE VIEW

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.904
FINDS HIM ADORABLE

00:34:33.772 --> 00:34:39.477
ENJOY THE VIEW, EVERYONE

00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:45.617
WALKING ALONG THE RIDGE
WITH THE MATTERHORN IN THE BACKGROUND

00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:47.586
SPOTS SOMETHING

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:49.621
There's a yellow one here.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:51.656
So cute.

00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:54.759
It's an ant.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.162
-Move.
-[Jimin] It's good now.

00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:59.197
-Let me do this.
-Don't.

00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:01.266
-[Jung Kook] Hey!
-[chuckles]

00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:03.368
Forget it.

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:06.037
Geez, you keep getting in the way.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:09.441
YELLOW FLOWER
(FEAT. JIMIN'S FINGER)

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:12.644
These blue and yellow flowers
are so beautiful. They're so cute.

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:17.315
These two are paired up together.

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:19.117
THE FLOWERS ARE A DUO JUST LIKE THEM

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:21.152
Huh?

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:22.687
You're pretty, too.

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:28.226
[Jimin sighs]

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.261
Huh?

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.563
[in English] Why, why, why?

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:33.198
Found one.

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.867
Such a cute one.

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:39.504
[in Korean] Jung Kook
really likes flowers.

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.073
Flowers are nice.

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:45.610
Rather than a big flower field,

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:49.280
these tiny flowers blooming
between places like this,

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.548
they're way cuter.

00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:54.552
We're so high up right now,

00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:56.721
and yet there's still water.

00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:58.523
Wow, the water's so clear.

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:00.992
Can you see it?

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.060
Can you?

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:07.532
[screeching]

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:10.101
A MYSTERIOUS SOUND

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.302
What's that sound?

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.038
There.

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.506
Where?

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.574
-[Jung Kook] Is that a marmot?
-[man] Yeah.

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.642
It's a marmot.

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:19.310
ANOTHER PIECE OF NATURE FOUND

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:20.612
Marmot, marmot.

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:24.049
CAN YOU SEE IT?

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:27.485
MARMOT

00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:30.622
I actually saw a marmot scream
for the first time.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.991
So that's how they scream.

00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:35.727
IMITATING THE MARMOT

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:36.895
They scream like this.

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.663
WAS THAT WHAT I SOUNDED LIKE...?

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.998
Jimin.

00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:42.367
-Yes, I'm here.
-We're almost there.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.671
We're not getting any closer.

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:48.139
We're almost there.

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:53.511
WITH EVERY STEP, EXCITEMENT FILLS THE AIR

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:58.817
AND WITH EACH BREATH,
SCENERY GETS MORE BEAUTIFUL

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.120
FINALLY ARRIVED HERE

00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:05.490
HIKING - PARAGLIDING

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:07.125
[Jimin] Are they coming back down?

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.627
-Or just flying off?
-They're going.

00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:11.429
[Jung Kook] It looks so fun.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.834
FLYING 2,800 METERS ABOVE ZERMATT
WITH THE WHOLE VIEW SPREAD BENEATH THEM

00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:19.838
FEELING THE BEAUTY OF SWITZERLAND
WITH THEIR WHOLE BODY

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:24.175
I thought I had to try paragliding
if I came here.

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.910
This is scary.

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.046
I really want to do it, but...

00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:30.415
But I'll do it anyway.

00:37:31.316 --> 00:37:32.517
[in English] Ready to fly?

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:33.918
[in English] Yeah, I'm ready.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.887
-Um...
-Ready to go.

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:39.491
It's time to go. It's time to fly.

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:40.992
SUPER EXCITED

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:42.393
[in English] So nervous.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.629
SUPER NERVOUS

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:46.297
Little bit scared.

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:48.133
-What's your name again?
-Jung Kook.

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:50.135
THE FEARLESS ONE, JUNG KOOK, GOES FIRST

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.137
I'll give you sexy outfit.

00:37:53.872 --> 00:37:55.373
Sexy outfit!

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:59.444
SEXY OUTFIT SUITS HIM PERFECTLY

00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:00.612
[in Korean] I'm excited.

00:38:02.981 --> 00:38:06.251
ONE MAN EMBRACES SOLITUDE
INSTEAD OF THRILL

00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:07.886
[in Korean] I'm scared.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.555
I mean,

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:15.293
how often do you get a chance to paraglide
from 2,700 meters up?

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:18.897
[instructor] I will ask
if you want to try big turns?

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:22.167
-You can say yes or no, okay?
-[in English] No.

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:24.936
[in Korean] What's
"geobjaeng-i" in English?

00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:26.337
[man in English] Scaredy-cat.

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:29.507
I AM A SCAREDY-CAT

00:38:29.574 --> 00:38:32.443
LIKE A FRIGHTENED RED PANDA

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.145
I'm kind of trembling.

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:38.616
My voice might be gone when we land.

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:41.452
SCREAMING

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.321
100% SERIOUS, 0% JOKING

00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:46.524
It does look like fun, though.
It's just that it's scary.

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:54.299
PUTTING ON SUNGLASSES FOR EYE PROTECTION

00:38:54.365 --> 00:39:01.306
GETTING BASIC SAFETY TRAINING
FOR SAFE FLIGHT

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:05.476
IT'S FINALLY STARTING TO FEEL REAL

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.648
Even I don't trust myself.

00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:13.351
I don't trust you.

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.587
Me, me.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.259
MEANWHILE, THE OTHER ONE'S
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE

00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:25.296
ENERGY LEVEL: MAX

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.865
[instructor] Okay, are you ready?

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.132
READY TO DIVE INTO THE SKY

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.534
[Jimin in English] I'm ready.

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:33.605
SEE YOU BACK ON THE GROUND

00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:39.143
JUNG KOOK'S PARACHUTE LIFTS OFF FIRST

00:39:44.249 --> 00:39:48.186
STUMBLES A BIT
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY PARACHUTE

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:52.924
[whooping]

JUNG KOOK ALSO GREETS ARMY FROM THE SKY

00:45:50.715 --> 00:45:52.250
[sighs contentedly]

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:57.722
This might be the best moment of my life.

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.023
[both cheering]

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.591
[instructor] Oh, thank you!

00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:01.892
[Jimin] Thank you, Matthew.

00:46:02.727 --> 00:46:08.266
THE VIEW FROM THE SKY
THEY'LL REMEMBER FOREVER

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:12.103
LANDING SPOT GETTING CLOSER

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.505
WOBBLING IN RELUCTANCE TO END IT

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:16.240
Be ready to stand up, huh?

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:17.308
Stand up?

00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:18.909
-When we land.
-Okay, okay.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:22.179
GETTING READY FOR LANDING

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:27.385
SOFT LANDING: SUCCESS

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.753
[in Korean] That was insane.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.855
That was so fun.

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.423
I don't want it to end.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.293
JIMIN LANDS RIGHT AFTER

00:46:36.027 --> 00:46:38.162
SAFE LANDING COMPLETE

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:42.833
SHARING A THANKFUL HUG

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.404
JUST GRATEFUL TO BE BACK ON SOLID GROUND

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.538
[whoops]

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.006
He's okay.

00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:52.710
TEARS OF JOY (?)

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:55.646
Really, best moment in my life.

00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:57.915
EXPRESSING HIS HEARTFELT THANKS ONCE AGAIN

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:00.151
-I'm glad you enjoyed.
-Okay. Thank you.

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:05.790
ONE SUMMER DAY IN JUNE 2025,
THEY FINISH PARAGLIDING SUCCESSFULLY

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.392
Jimin, that was so fun, right?

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:10.061
-[in Korean] I was so happy.
-Right?

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.329
But it was really scary.

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.563
How scary?

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:14.965
I saw two mountains at first.

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:16.033
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.101
-So scared?
-Yeah.

00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:21.005
For people like me,
this kind of thing is a huge challenge.

00:47:21.072 --> 00:47:23.174
You can do it, too, everyone,
whatever it is.

00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:26.577
But seeing everything from up there
was so beautiful.

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:30.448
The way the mountains framed both sides
was shockingly pretty.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.550
And what's interesting is, from up there,

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.253
you know you're moving so fast
when you look down at your shadow.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.323
But when you look up,
it's completely still, like a photo.

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.092
It was fascinating.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.827
-[Jimin] Everything's so huge.
-Yeah.

00:47:43.494 --> 00:47:45.262
All I could say was, "Wow."

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.564
Wow...

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.065
You said, "Wow"?

00:47:48.132 --> 00:47:49.834
I was screaming... the whole time.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.369
I screamed so much.

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:53.104
I want to do it again.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.172
Me too. Maybe next year?
[laughing]

00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.276
I really want to, though.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.579
I mean, if you get the chance,

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:05.616
this is something you should experience
at least once in life. Paragliding.

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:10.521
When would we ever paraglide
from this high again?

00:48:10.588 --> 00:48:11.589
Never.

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.224
-Yeah, probably.
-Right.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.394
I was really happy.
I captured it all with my eyes.

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:19.563
I want to get a paragliding license.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.698
You could do it.

00:48:20.765 --> 00:48:22.967
I want to get certified and fly on my own.

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:26.704
JUNG KOOK'S DREAM FOR THE FUTURE

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:31.342
If I had to do this again,
I'd need a lot of courage again.

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:33.511
[man] Think you'd do it again?

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.379
Yeah, I think I would.

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:38.149
-You were so happy, right?
-I was, so...

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:42.119
-But you wouldn't understand this feeling.
-Why not?

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:45.823
That moment
when fear and happiness coexist...

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.458
You wouldn't know.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:51.429
A HERD OF GOATS THEY RUN INTO

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:55.866
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK ARE ALSO ON THEIR WAY
BACK TO THE LODGE

00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:59.270
[Jimin] I think I'm really happy here.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:03.107
-I was truly happy.
-[Jung Kook] The best, really the best.

00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:07.545
-[Jimin] Hey, give me the key card.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:08.612
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.215
JIMIN WINS IN ONE SHOT

00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:13.818
-I knew it. Jimin.
-What?

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:15.586
-Jimin.
-Yeah?

00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:17.121
[both laughing]

00:49:17.188 --> 00:49:19.256
JIMIN HEADS STRAIGHT TO HIS ROOM

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.391
[singing]

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:25.396
NOW IT'S JUST JUNG KOOK ON THE SOFA
HE AND JIMIN SAT ON TOGETHER

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:28.799
I'll...

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.502
go wash up.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.872
[Jung Kook] What about the staff?

00:49:34.939 --> 00:49:37.942
-[woman] Went to eat in the restaurant.
-Really?

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:41.212
DINNER'S READY AND WAITING

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.513
You sit there.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.415
-So it is risotto.
-What's this?

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:47.885
-It looks like tomato soup.
-[Jimin] Thank you for the meal.

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:53.224
[both exclaiming]

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:54.825
-This is...
-This is...

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:58.362
-Real risotto.
-Real risotto.

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:03.000
THEIR PLAYFUL DNA IS STILL STRONG

00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:05.803
CONDUCTING AN ORCHESTRA OF FLAVORS
WITH A SPOON

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:07.338
ROLLING IT UP

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:08.939
ROLLING FAILED

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:12.743
SETTLED TO JUST EAT IN HIS USUAL WAY

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.847
EATING PASTA LIKE KOREAN SOUP

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:19.116
-With some bread...
-Put it on top of the bread.

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:20.951
Tastes kind of like potato pancake.

00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:22.653
Really?

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.789
ONE BITE OF RÖSTI ON TOP OF BREAD

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:26.991
Is this potato?

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:29.426
I hate bell peppers.

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.628
BELL PEPPER HATER

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:33.297
You're right.

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.199
Potato. Steamed potato.

00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:37.735
It's a bit lacking, huh?

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:40.771
STARTING TO CRAVE SPICY KOREAN FOOD

00:50:40.838 --> 00:50:42.172
A bowl of ramyeon?

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:44.408
-Sure.
-I think I'm in good form today.

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:47.111
THE SOUND OF THE WATER POURING

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.712
[Jung Kook] Into hot water...

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:51.248
-[Jimin] The water's different, right?
-Yeah.

00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:52.716
FROM THE VISPA RIVER

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.251
Give me the soup powder.

00:50:54.919 --> 00:50:56.220
All the flakes.

00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:57.955
Add the noodles.

00:50:58.022 --> 00:50:59.623
-Right now?
-Add them in.

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:02.126
YOU ADD NOODLES, I ADD THE POWDER

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:03.827
I'LL ADD THE FLAKES

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.429
YOU ADD THE SOUP BASE

00:51:05.496 --> 00:51:08.265
PERFECT TEAMWORK

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:10.668
-[Jimin] Add the Buldak sauce?
-Lots of it.

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:11.936
[Jimin] All right.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.772
SIP OF BROTH

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:15.906
It's spicy.

00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:17.074
-Is it?
-I like it.

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.043
It's perfect.

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.244
It's ready.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.147
-It's ready!
-It's ready!

00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:24.915
[Jung Kook] Made it spicy.

00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:26.784
KOREAN-STYLE SPICY RAMYEON IS READY

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:30.454
-Jung Kook, thanks.
-Sure.

00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.891
K-NOODLE NOSTALGIA

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:37.928
ENJOYING THE RAMYEON I COOKED MYSELF

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:41.098
SATISFIED

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.201
I'm sweating
all over my nose bridge. Gosh.

00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:47.004
FLAVOR THAT MAKES YOUR TONGUE APPLAUD

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:52.476
AN EATING SHOW BEGINS

00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:55.212
PERFECTLY SYNCED NOODLE SLURPING

00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:58.549
AT THE SAME TIME

00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.150
Every Korean needs

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:03.787
to have something spicy once in a while.

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:06.023
We haven't had spicy food here yet.

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:08.726
It was about time.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.195
EATING MODE ON

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.433
Remember the chili peppers we bought?

00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:18.902
SPICY PARTY

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.204
[groans]

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.438
Sweating a lot.

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:25.142
YEAH, I'M TALKING ABOUT ME

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:28.078
This ramyeon makes me so shy.

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.047
How does ramyeon make you shy?

00:52:31.215 --> 00:52:34.752
BECAUSE THE RAMYEON MAKES MY CHEEKS RED

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:37.788
[man] Do you usually add Buldak sauce
to ramyeon?

00:52:37.855 --> 00:52:41.592
I usually add about one swirl.

00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:45.062
MEANWHILE, JIMIN'S APPETITE
WAS FULLY UNLEASHED

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:47.965
NONSTOP SLURPING

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.534
SWEATING LIKE HE'S SHOWERING

00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:52.469
JUNG KOOK SWEATING JUST AS MUCH

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:54.805
Jimin, is today your final day
or something?

00:52:54.872 --> 00:52:57.541
ARE YOU OKAY, TISSUE MAN?

00:52:57.975 --> 00:52:59.143
[Jimin] That was so good.

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:00.377
I'm so full.

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:03.313
[Jimin] Koreans and ramyeon
are inseparable.

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:06.617
-Let's sit down.
-Okay.

00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:08.318
Let's sit and have a conversation.

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:13.590
NEURON CONNECTION

00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:15.159
We really...

00:53:16.894 --> 00:53:18.028
have no self-control.

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.030
Is this right?

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:22.366
[sighs]

00:53:22.433 --> 00:53:24.601
Skipping breakfast is pointless.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.372
No, you can't do that.

00:53:28.439 --> 00:53:29.440
You can't.

00:53:30.107 --> 00:53:33.410
SETTLED WITH HIS LEGS INSTEAD OF HIS BELLY

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.380
[singing]

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:39.583
LEGS EQUIPPED WITH RECLINER FUNCTION

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.351
Feels like you're washing my hair.

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:45.422
Done?

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:47.624
HAIR WASH COMPLETE IN THREE SECONDS

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:53.664
STEALING HIS GLASSES

00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:54.798
I can see clearly.

00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:55.966
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:59.703
-Expensive lenses.
-So expensive, you can go through them?

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.871
INVISIBLE LENSES

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:03.373
ALMOST X-RAY VISION (?)

00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:04.942
ARMY,

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.512
I've broken my promise again today.

00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.247
Today...

00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:12.149
I really broke it big time.

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:13.650
I'm sorry.

00:54:14.685 --> 00:54:17.087
But I don't just eat thoughtlessly.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.889
I always keep

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.859
a little bit of guilt
in one corner of my heart.

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.694
"I ate a lot again today."

00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:25.896
I go to bed feeling sorry for it.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:27.998
Let's eat less tomorrow.

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:36.473
RE-ENTERING THE ROOM

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.544
Feels like I'll need
another shower tonight.

00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:48.652
SUDDENLY STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:51.555
PROTECTING THE ARTIST

00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:52.689
What do I do with this?

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.224
This is so...

00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.260
What do I do?

00:54:57.561 --> 00:55:02.099
CHANGED INTO GOING-OUT CLOTHES

00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:03.367
Will it be cold?

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:09.540
I can just go out like this, right?

00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:15.212
JUNG KOOK IS READY TO GO

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:19.116
THE SUNSET COLORS
SPREADING ACROSS THE CLOUDS

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.853
THE STREETS OF ZERMATT IS STILL GLOWING

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:27.090
AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE
ON THE STREET

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.828
JUNG KOOK HEADS OUT
TO ENJOY ZERMATT AT NIGHT

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.830
SCENERY BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:36.033
[man] The gelato shop over there
is super famous.

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:37.968
This one? That's why there's a line, huh?

00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:41.572
CHECKING OUT THE FAMOUS GELATO SHOP

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:44.274
I thought it was closer. Maybe not?

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.111
Here it is.

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.379
DESTINATION

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:51.982
THIS PLACE IS...

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:57.221
ON THE WAY BACK TO THEIR HOTEL LAST NIGHT

00:55:57.821 --> 00:56:02.392
I saw two people
sitting outside at a table,

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:06.563
just playing cards
and having beer together.

00:56:08.065 --> 00:56:09.600
Looked so nice.

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:10.968
Because, you know...

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:16.740
In Korea, we can't really drink
in front of a shop like that.

00:56:16.807 --> 00:56:17.808
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:21.278
JUST WANTED TO ENJOY
THAT KIND OF SIMPLE FREEDOM

00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:25.315
ENTERING THE GATE OF FREEDOM

00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.718
JIMIN IS ALREADY THERE, WAITING

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.220
Now that I'm here,
I actually feel like drinking.

00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:31.455
Being outside.

00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:33.690
Something random?

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:37.661
Since we're in Switzerland,
maybe we should try Swiss whisky?

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.263
-[man in English] Okay.
-Okay.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.564
[in Korean] I've decided.

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:42.633
-Jung Kook, draft beer?
-Yup.

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.768
-[in English] Draft beer.
-[in English] Okay.

00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:46.336
TIME TO ORDER

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:50.841
-Draft beer, three. Okay, and...
-Three.

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:55.712
-Swiss whisky iced, two.
-Yes.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.615
-Two. Ice?
-Yes, ice, yes.

00:56:58.682 --> 00:57:00.851
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:03.020
ORDER PLACED SMOOTHLY

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:12.496
MEANWHILE, THE COLD BEER IS READY

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:15.132
[in Korean] Hey, Jimin.
What's that beer over there?

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:18.769
It's coming. It's coming.

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:19.937
WOW

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:23.106
THE LONG-AWAITED BEER HAS ARRIVED

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:25.642
GIVE ME THE COLD BEER QUICKLY

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:27.244
GULPING

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:28.312
JIMIN'S WHISKEY

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:29.446
[in English] Thank you.

00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:31.114
JUNG KOOK'S DRAFT BEER

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:34.318
CHEERS

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.453
This beer is...

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.521
huge.

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:42.459
THROAT FULLY OPEN

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.863
Beer really is the best.

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:49.800
[in Korean] This one...

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:54.371
Since it had Swiss in the name,
I think it's Swiss whiskey.

00:57:54.438 --> 00:57:55.706
Let me give it a try.

00:57:58.709 --> 00:57:59.977
Smells really sweet.

00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:03.347
It does. You're right.

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:05.716
CHEERS...

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.051
What was it again? Santé?

00:58:08.552 --> 00:58:09.553
Santé.

00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.756
TASTING SWISS WHISKEY IN SWITZERLAND

00:58:15.559 --> 00:58:16.560
[sighs]

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.363
It feels so nice
to be out drinking like this.

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:23.467
-Right?
-Just sitting here, relaxing.

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:28.739
It really is such a fun little town.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.475
Yeah.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.912
A PLACE THAT HOLDS

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:38.715
BOTH LIVELINESS AND PEACE

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.551
DISCOVERING THE CHARMS

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.654
OF ZERMATT AT NIGHT

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:49.659
[Jung Kook] These fries are so good.

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:52.963
SWISS FRIES RIGHT UP HIS ALLEY

00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:03.006
PAUSE

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.309
PLAY

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:08.879
PAUSE AGAIN

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.148
SWISS ARMY APPEARS

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:13.116
WAVING HELLO TO ARMY

00:59:13.183 --> 00:59:16.787
AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER
WITH A SWISS ARMY GIRL

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:17.854
How did she know?

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:19.956
She's crying.

00:59:22.159 --> 00:59:24.828
AN ARMY GIRL TEARING UP
BY THE SUDDEN MEETING

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:27.197
GOODBYE, ARMY GIRL

00:59:27.264 --> 00:59:28.432
She's adorable.

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:31.134
A SHORT BUT HEARTWARMING ENCOUNTER

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:34.471
A MOMENT THE ARMY GIRL WILL NEVER FORGET

00:59:35.472 --> 00:59:37.374
AND A MOMENT WE'LL NEVER FORGET EITHER

00:59:37.441 --> 00:59:41.711
A SIP OF REFRESHING BEER

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:46.049
A SIP OF BITTERSWEET WHISKEY

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:47.851
The sun's setting.

00:59:49.553 --> 00:59:50.954
Right, almost.

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:54.825
-You know...
-It feels like nighttime now.

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.962
DARKNESS SLOWLY FALLS

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:05.068
SERENITY SPREADS THROUGH THE VILLAGE

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.906
[Jung Kook] It really is nice at night.
You just want to sit still.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:14.511
Honestly, I wanted to have a drink
with you like this here.

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:17.647
Because, in Korea,
we never really get this kind of chance.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.283
WANTED TO ENJOY A SLOW, OUTDOOR MOMENT

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:23.386
AND TONIGHT

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.822
THEY'RE ENJOYING THAT FREEDOM IN ZERMATT

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:27.224
[Jung Kook humming]

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.859
Are you only drinking that one?

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.393
Yeah, it's my fourth glass.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.465
After this one, let's go back.

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:37.501
-Yeah.
-We gotta wake up early tomorrow.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:44.107
Looks like most of the places
are open until midnight.

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:46.977
I think this place has the most tourists.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.745
It's lively.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.516
[Jimin] God, I just love this.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:58.855
You said you wanted to live
in Switzerland, right? At least for a bit.

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:01.358
Was it here or somewhere else?

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.426
The place that fits my taste best.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.797
I like the flashiest, most lively spot.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.034
-Like this kind of town?
-Yeah, exactly.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.103
It's nice. Really nice.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:17.974
ZERMATT, A TOWN THAT STOLE THEIR HEARTS

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:21.678
We did quite a lot of enjoyable things
here in Zermatt.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:24.214
If we go skiing tomorrow,
it'll be the perfect finale.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:25.282
Skiing.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.450
Hope I'm not sore when I wake up.

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:29.386
Tell me if you are, okay?

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:31.955
IT HURTS

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.924
If you are, let's go sledding instead.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.059
Sledding sounds fun, too.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:39.262
We can just grab a plastic bag
and slide down.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:40.697
Let me know if it hurts.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.732
I put it on wrong.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.568
I'll peel this one off.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:50.006
You see, I almost never put on bandages
when I get hurt.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.108
-But...
-I take it off in a day.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.444
I don't really care if it leaves a scar.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.379
-I'm like that, too.
-Right.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.649
But it's not about me. It's about you.
You're like my little brother.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.251
So I'd rather you didn't.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:02.819
Still, it's a memory, you know?

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.021
-Not really.
-Of when you got hurt.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.823
SCARS = MEMORIES

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.859
Like this?
The three stitches I got in the army?

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.661
I've got a few scars from there, too.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.296
Army life.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:16.299
You guys might not know this,
but Jung Kook has two scars here.

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:19.970
And I've got three...
No, four little dots here.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.439
I didn't think much.

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.942
Back when I got my first big one,

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:29.379
I didn't even realize what I was doing.
It was just so tiring, so...

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.615
-It was so heavy, I couldn't lift it.
-Yeah.

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.184
I was so tired,
so while I was holding the shovel,

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:35.785
I leaned on it.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:36.853
Oh!

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.921
You just leaned on it.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.290
-On such a hot pot?
-Yes.

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:43.760
Yeah, I leaned right on it.
That's how it happened.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:45.795
That's when I got the scar.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:49.466
THUS CONCLUDES JUNG KOOK'S LEGEND
OF HIS GLORIOUS SCAR

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:58.241
The first time I ever liked someone

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:02.879
who wasn't Korean
was when I went to the US

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.748
for that month-long trainee program.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.683
OHO?

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.185
-Weren't you in 9th grade then?
-8th grade.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.054
-8th grade?
-Yeah.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:15.692
It was a girl who was there
for dance lessons like me.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.995
She was also very young.
A student like me.

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:21.598
At first, I thought she was really pretty.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.466
HA HA HA HA HA

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.235
ADORABLE FIRST LOVE STORY

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.937
But then I started
seeing her really often.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.373
Then the teacher told me,

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:34.110
-"Go talk to her! Just once."
-Really?

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.147
HAPPY WITH THE STORY

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.315
CRACKING UP

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.950
But I was like,
"How? I don't even speak English."

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.452
We couldn't communicate.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.120
But if it were now?

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.890
-Maybe I would go for it.
-Right?

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.226
[in English] I like you.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.761
I like you.

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.833
SHY BOY

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.369
That's actually a cute story.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.371
-No need to edit it out.
-[in Korean] Yeah.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.006
-Only in 8th grade.
-I was young.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:07.077
-You still remember it fondly, huh?
-Of course.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.979
Like an unfulfilled love kind of thing.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.949
-"The Truth Untold."
-Yeah, "The Truth Untold."

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.118
I couldn't even say a word.

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:20.824
[singing]

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.226
[both singing]

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:38.675
IN BEAUTIFUL ZERMATT

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:42.479
THEY REMINISCE ABOUT BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:47.751
You know how we sang "The Truth Untold"
back in the army karaoke?

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:52.789
If we approach it the way we practiced
back then, it'll come out smoother.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.791
Honestly, that song...

01:04:55.458 --> 01:05:01.030
During BTS concerts, it always felt like
a bit of trauma for me.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.666
Even though we practiced together
in the military,

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.536
I also had lessons after I got out.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.805
-Right.
-But there's one problem.

01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.540
-What?
-It's...

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.542
It doesn't sound cool.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:13.610
Cool?

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:18.581
Well, you can add that flair
after you get comfortable with it.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.150
At first, I was taken aback.

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:22.886
Because you can't just add coolness

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:27.857
-unless you've sung like that before.
-Right.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:31.661
-I'd never sung like that in 10 years.
-Yes. Right.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:33.863
Only now, after all that new training,

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.533
I can finally sing
without hurting my throat.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.334
And...

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.906
I think singing clean and simple
might sound better.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:46.910
I still take lessons with my teacher,
but I also have you, you know?

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.645
I listen to how you sing,

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.614
then think back to what I've learned.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.950
And I think there's this connection.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.453
What you say and what my teacher says

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.521
are totally different,

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.357
-Right.
-but when I hear you sing,

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.793
it actually sounds pretty similar.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.195
Listening nearby...

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.997
Anyway, I've realized one thing for sure.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:13.736
You have great strengths,
and we're totally different.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.072
I've learned that.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:21.644
And despite that,
since we've practiced together,

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:23.646
all the advice you've given me

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:27.350
has always helped me a lot.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.786
That's the most important part.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:32.755
Shall we go?

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:35.692
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go. I'll go pay.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.494
You're paying, right?

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.396
Give us one chance a day.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:41.831
One card-swipe chance.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:44.634
For the director and all the staff, too.

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.603
Whatever it is, just once.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.670
Jimin Chance?

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:50.073
You want anything?

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.140
JIMIN CHANCE DAY

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.208
You already ordered?

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:54.244
JIMIN MADE SURE THE STAFF GOT THEIR MEALS

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.745
Okay.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:56.813
Sounds good.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.782
Honestly, I was so tired today.
I didn't want to come out.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:04.020
But I did because I wanted to grab
some beer with all the staff.

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:06.890
We insisted on it, and I'm glad we did.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.625
SO NICE

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.759
I'm happy right now.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.530
[man] Jimin's buying.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.466
THUMBS UP

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.967
We made you come here.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:22.071
It wasn't even on today's schedule.
We were supposed to rest.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.575
We're supposed to play a game, right?

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:27.010
A GAME WAS SCHEDULED TONIGHT

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.344
Who cares about the game?

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:30.713
We should. We need an allowance.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.849
-[man] You must do it tomorrow.
-Of course.

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:35.852
AT THE COUNTER

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.927
JUST ONE TAP, AND THE PAYMENT GOES THROUGH

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.161
JUST TAP

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:46.796
This is modern life.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.901
PARK JIMIN FLEX

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:01.210
A HEALING EVENING FROM START TO FINISH

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.781
APPLAUSE! COOL GUY PARK JIMIN

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:08.251
Thank you, everyone!

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.219
AN EVENING WHERE EVERYONE WAS HAPPY

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.021
[both laughing]

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:16.259
LIKE THE ENDING OF A YOUTH MOVIE

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:24.534
-[Jimin] Good night.
-[Jung Kook] Good night!

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:29.272
CHECKING HIS APPEARANCE ON CAMERA
EVEN BEFORE BED

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.915
You'll see it on screen,

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:42.685
but when I look at the camera here,

01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.189
it follows my eyes and face around.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.824
CAMERA VIEW JIMIN IS LOOKING AT

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:48.891
FUN, RIGHT?

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.563
JIMIN TIPTOES OFF TO WASH UP

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.165
JIMIN EXITS, JUNG KOOK ENTERS

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:02.171
WHERE IS IT?

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.678
THERE IT IS

01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:14.584
FOUND PAJAMAS HIDDEN BETWEEN PILLOWS

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:22.425
JUNG KOOK IN PAJAMAS

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.528
JIMIN'S READY FOR BED TOO

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.296
HYDRATION TIME +1

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.133
HYDRATION TIME +2

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:36.105
FLOPPING

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.643
FWOOSH

01:09:41.244 --> 01:09:44.280
MASSAGING

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:51.487
FOOT MASSAGE

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:59.996
SATISFIED

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:02.965
TIME TO GO TO SLEEP

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:07.970
ZZZ...

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.740
Let's go to bed.

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:13.009
Today was a long, tiring day.

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:16.412
Is this it?

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.283
God, nothing's going my way.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.688
You go there.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.259
And you here.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:35.531
GETTING INTO BED, PERFECTLY POSITIONED

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:44.841
I got to set an alarm.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:52.982
ALARM SET FOR 7:20

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:55.651

ALARM SET FOR 7:25

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.490
I'm going to sleep.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:02.925
Good night, everyone.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:08.531
See you tomorrow.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:11.367
Bye.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.308
SNORING

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.477
SNORING

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.780
SNORING

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:36.359
NIGHT PASSES
AND MORNING DAWNS AGAIN OVER ZERMATT

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:41.330
THE MATTERHORN BATHED IN GOLDEN SUNLIGHT

[birds chirping]

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:44.734
WARM RAYS FILL THE AIR

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:48.104
A PEACEFUL MORNING IN ZERMATT

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:52.842
THE FIFTH DAY IN SWITZERLAND BEGINS

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.977
TODAY'S PLAN:
SKI AND SNOWBOARD

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.480
GROCERY SHOPPING, DINNER,
A TORCHLIGHT TOUR

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.983
STILL QUIET INSIDE THE LODGE

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:11.661
ALARM GOES OFF

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:18.201
FEET WAKE UP FIRST

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.437
7:15 A.M.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:29.478

2ND ALARM ATTACK, 7:20

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.125
AN ALARM THAT REFUSES TO GIVE UP

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.569
IS HE GETTING UP NOW...?

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.905
TURNING OFF THE ALARM

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:07.917
3RD ALARM ATTACK, 7:25

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.792
THE ALARM LOSES THE BATTLE

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.065
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.135

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.949
I'LL GO GET CHANGED, HEHE

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.617
HEY, I REALLY NEED TO GET CHANGED

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:23.452
WHY IS THIS...

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:26.789
HE'S ALL DRESSED NOW

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:30.659
TA-DA

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:40.169
JUNG KOOK'S ALREADY OUTSIDE WAITING

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.238
Should we take this?

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.744
QUICK STEPS TO PUT ON SHOES

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.546
I SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.688
ALL READY FOR REAL THIS TIME

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:01.791
Should we bring water?

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:04.026
[man] Nope, we'll buy it there.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.196
KICKING OFF EXCITING DAY 5

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:14.804

-[in English] Thank you.
-[man] You're welcome.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.212
[in Korean] Let's go, let's go.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.149
How can we snowboard
in this kind of weather?

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:28.217
EXCITEMENT LEVEL: MAX

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:29.618
I can't believe it.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.854
[♪ upbeat music playing]

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:35.157
VAST SKI SLOPES
SPREADING AROUND THE MATTERHORN

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:39.128
A MASTERPIECE OF NATURE'S MAKING

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:42.364
MATTERHORN SKI PARADISE

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.400
EUROPE'S HIGHEST SKI RESORT

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.435
WHERE YOU CAN SKI ALL YEAR ROUND

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:48.704
TAKING THE GONDOLA TO THE TOP

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.539
-[Jimin] Should I put mine, too?
-Yeah.

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:56.946
FULL OF ANTICIPATION

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.547
Feels like I'm on a ride.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:05.921
THE GONDOLA GLIDES ENDLESSLY
OVER THE GREEN SCENERY

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.724
It goes all the way up there?

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.361
It's climbing faster than I thought.

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:15.431
In winter, this whole mountain
must be covered in snow.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:17.466
Right?

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:18.534
Wow.

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.570
EXCITEMENT RISING ALONG WITH THE GONDOLA

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.771
It's going to be epic.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:28.010
Once we pass that point,
you'll see the Matterhorn.

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.379
We'll show you.

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:32.648
You'll see the Matterhorn, on the right.

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:34.216
[Jung Kook] Wait, there.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.284
It really is.

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:37.853
-That's it? My gosh.
-[Jimin] It is.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.823
-We're so close now.
-Yeah, right?

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:45.060
AS THEY ASCEND TOWARD THE MATTERHORN

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.496
THE SNOW-CAPPED PEAKS SLOWLY APPEAR

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:50.332
It feels like we're floating.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.067
Like this.

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:54.770
FLOATING IN MID-AIR(?)

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.038
About to drop down.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:58.841
You see, gravity...

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:01.243
is really something.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.545
[laughing]

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.782
It must feel amazing
to actually fly up here.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.150
Totally.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:12.588
I fell asleep thinking about flying.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.624
So? Did you fly in your dream?

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.260
No, I fought with my mom in my dream.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.797
I was back in the army.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.633
YIKES, THAT'S ROUGH...

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:26.635
AFTER ROCKY TERRAIN

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.337
THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN FINALLY APPEARS

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.339
Wow, we're climbing so high.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:33.008
-I think it's that side, over there.
-Right.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:37.346
But that slope's definitely not my level.

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.015
I wonder if there's an easier one for me.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:41.584
I'm so excited.

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:43.752
We should get ready to get off.

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.455
-[Jimin] Let's go.
-[Jung Kook] Let's go.

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:47.723
[Jimin] Wait a sec.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:48.791
TIME TO HIT THE SLOPES

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:53.762
HEARTS RACING

01:18:54.697 --> 01:19:00.269
GETTING FULLY GEARED UP

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.777
-[Jimin] The snow's blinding.
-Yup.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:12.414
SURROUNDED BY DAZZLING WHITE SNOW

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:16.252
AFTER A 3,883-METER GONDOLA RIDE
TO THE TOP

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:19.588
THE EUROPEAN SKI SPOT
THAT WELCOMES SNOW LOVERS YEAR-ROUND

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.758
MATTERHORN GLACIER PARADISE

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:23.892
CLIFFS HIDDEN BENEATH

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.761
BOUNDARIES INVISIBLE, STAY CAUTIOUS

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:29.465
ONE-ON-ONE SAFETY LESSON BEGINS

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.467
JIMIN IN BASIC TRAINING

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.168
Left, right.

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:36.939
Push. You let it slide. Yeah, exactly.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:40.442
In place... Good. Yeah, exactly. One more.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:44.747
MEANWHILE, JUNG KOOK
IS PRACTICING SNOWBOARDING

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.550
This is hard.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:53.622
[exclaims]

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:56.759
It's not working.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:58.627
Go, and...

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:04.166
[grunts, chuckles]

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:05.234
Nope.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:07.336
So tough.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:11.807
You just have to keep riding it.

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:16.745
DOING IT FOR REAL IS THE BEST TRAINING

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:22.351
360-DEGREE SPIN, SUCCESS

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:28.557
GOT THE HANG OF IT

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:32.394
READY TO GO FOR REAL

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:37.299
PLEASE ENJOY FOR A MOMENT
WITHOUT SUBTITLES

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:43.605
JUNG KOOK

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:53.215
JUNG KOOK

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.152
[grunts]

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.289
JUNG KOOK

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:04.693
THIS TIME, HIGHER DIFFICULTY

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.163
[speaking indistinctly]

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.065
FALLING

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.500
[groans]

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:15.404
HOW FAR DOWN ARE YOU GOING?

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:21.477
EVEN FALLING DOWN IS FUN, HEHE

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:22.945
THUMBS UP

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:28.884
WITH A PICTURE-PERFECT BACKGROUND

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:32.287
JUNG KOOK SPEEDS DOWN THE SLOPE

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:34.490
This is so fun.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.559
JUNG KOOK

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.061
ACROSS THE PURE WHITE SNOW

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:40.295
So fun.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.832
SNOWBOARDING CONTINUES

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.134
[exclaiming]

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:52.341
This is fun.

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:54.343
So much fun.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:55.878
SATISFACTION LEVEL: MAX

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:04.887
HERE COMES ANOTHER EAGER STUDENT, JIMIN

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.588
JIMIN

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:11.860
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING
THE HANG OF IT NOW...?

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.730
Why do I keep stopping mid-way?

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:16.799
The right side works fine.

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:19.635
THEN...

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:23.472
PRACTICING REPEATEDLY IS THE ONLY WAY

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:30.345
[in English] Okay.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.951
JIMIN STARTS TO ENJOY IT TOO

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.454
[Jimin] Really good, really good.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.521
-Really fun.
-Good job!

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:40.589
Thank you.

01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:44.026
NOW THAT HE'S WARMED UP,
TIME TO REALLY ENJOY

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:49.731
JIMIN GOES OFF FIRST

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.901
FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTOR

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.803
MASTERED HOW TO MOVE ON FLAT GROUND

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:56.104
[in Korean] So this is how.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.142
Ah.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:01.510
[in English] Like skate.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:08.050
[in Korean] My balance was completely off.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.719
Whoa!

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.654
[exhales]

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.225
Keep it like this? Balance?

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.127
I can walk on flat ground now.

01:23:19.795 --> 01:23:21.930
EXCITED

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:26.568
PICKING UP MOMENTUM,
HE TRIES STANDING ON ONE FOOT

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:32.641
[exclaims, laughs]

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:35.210
[whoops]

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.248
[gasping]

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:44.920
OUT OF ENERGY

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:47.789
[in English] Here, here. Fire.

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:49.324
[groans]

01:23:52.728 --> 01:23:53.929
Where is my friend?

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:55.030
[laughs]

01:23:55.464 --> 01:24:00.602
NOW IT'S JUNG KOOK'S TURN

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:04.706
STARTING OFF WITH A CAREFREE WAVE

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:05.774
JUNG KOOK

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:10.379
CARVING SMOOTHLY
THROUGH A SNOW-WHITE CANVAS

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:16.885
Come on!

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.288
[in Korean] I was waiting for you.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.658
JUNG KOOK

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.792
[in English] Okay.

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:25.527
[in Korean] He's good now.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.062
Oh.

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:31.366
JUNG KOOK

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.434
Show me.

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:36.872
SHOWING OFF PRO-LEVEL(?) BOARDING SKILLS

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:38.874
[Jimin] My thighs are going to explode.

01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:40.609
-[Jung Kook] Tired?
-Yeah.

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:43.445
[Jung Kook] It's been forever
since we did this.

01:24:45.147 --> 01:24:46.715
Are your thighs okay?

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.817
My calves hurt more.

01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:49.952
Calves for you.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.921
Tell me when you're ready.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.826
[Jimin in English] I love it.

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:58.927
Uh!

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:00.896
What was that?

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:05.467
Felt more like poop than a rock.

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:10.872
HE LOVES TO PULL A PRANK ON JIMIN
AND JIMIN'S USED TO IT

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.277
Let's go.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.880
You good? [in English] Let's go?

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.549
-Do you want to go?
-I want to go.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.654
I'm a strong man.

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:29.658
JIMIN IS STRONG

01:25:29.725 --> 01:25:31.893
Up, down.

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:35.697
Up, down.

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:41.169
A LITTLE SHAKY,
BUT SURPRISINGLY DOING WELL

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:45.874
[exclaiming nervously]

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:50.779
FLAP FLAP

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:53.215
[laughs]

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:54.883
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.685
[in Korean] The ice all melted.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:58.720
It's a water park now.

01:26:00.122 --> 01:26:01.123
SLIP

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:04.159
JUNG KOOK SLIDING ON MELTED SNOW

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.227
So hard.

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:09.264
FOLLOWING BEHIND

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:10.399
Jung Kook's not coming.

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:16.038
Snow's melting, so the flat part
must be tougher for boards.

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:18.440
DRAINING JUNG KOOK'S ENERGY

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.508
I'm exhausted.

01:26:21.143 --> 01:26:22.310
I'll lose weight.

01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:24.813
I finally made it.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.250
JIMIN

01:26:30.052 --> 01:26:31.520
SLIP

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:35.624
A NEAR-MISS LANDING AT THE FINISH LINE

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.959
The ice melted so much, it's tough.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.629
I DID IT

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:43.532
A GRATEFUL HIGH-FIVE

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.902
KNOCKED OUT

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.170
This is really tough.

GOOD JOB, GUYS
