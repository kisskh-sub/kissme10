WEBVTT

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:08.353
(Male participants, please
head over to enjoy breakfast.)

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:13.253
(A breakfast date with 5 younger men?)

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:16.423
(Who does the empty seat belong to?)

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:20.793
(So Hyun, the fifth older woman
to appear before the younger men)

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:22.409
(Breakfast date, )

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.209
(So Hyun's benefit for joining later)

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.739
(We'll treat you really well today.)

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.333
(Don't do a thing. We'll do everything.)

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.319
(The breakfast date for So Hyun...)

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:32.703
(with the five younger men)

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.643
(And with the date ticket on the line, )

00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:39.443
(the younger men's 3-Minute Match)

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:44.553
(A match concerning
the younger men's pride)

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.629
(The younger men work
hard to go on a date...)

00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:50.153
(with the younger woman they want.)

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:53.939
(After the match, )

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:57.303
(Bon Hee naturally takes care of Mu Jin.)

00:00:58.263 --> 00:00:59.563
(Glancing)

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:03.073
(Sang Hyeon had a lot on
his mind while watching them.)

00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:06.003
(Bon Hee, can I talk to you briefly?)

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.863
(Sang Hyeon asks to talk to Bon
Hee while she is with everyone.)

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:13.419
(I realized that he
wasn't interested in me.)

00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:16.129
(You were the only one I
was interested in romantically, )

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:18.029
(and so I wanted to talk to you.)

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:20.099
(It's hard not to notice...)

00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:21.363
(how Mu Jin takes care of you.)

00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:25.069
(It made me realize that
you two were already...)

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:26.939
(into each other so deeply.)

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:28.083
He's telling her everything.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:33.833
(I think I should give up on you.)

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:41.949
(And that night, someone
comes to see Sang Hyeon.)

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:43.373
(Tapping)

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:52.729
(So Hyun asked to talk to Sang Hyeon.)

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:54.669
(Feeling shy)

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:56.453
(Let me catch my breath.)

00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:58.999
(Since it happened out of the blue, )

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:00.693
(I was really bewildered.)

00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:03.263
(It was quite fascinating.)

00:02:03.903 --> 00:02:04.933
Nice.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:08.173
Last week, the younger men's...

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:11.573
Three-Minute Match caused quite a stir.

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:13.549
Sang Hyeon,

00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:15.649
having seen Bon Hee
hand a water bottle to Mu Jin,

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.189
- was deeply hurt.
- He was.

00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:19.459
What came as a relief, however, - Yes?

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:21.853
Was that So Hyun asked
to talk to Sang Hyeon,

00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:23.589
and told him she was rooting for him.

00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:25.229
- She spoke openly about it.
- Yes.

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:26.399
- Of course, she should.
- It must have

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:27.893
opened his heart to So Hyun.

00:02:28.153 --> 00:02:29.399
As someone rooting,

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:30.469
for Sang Hyeon,

00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:31.569
- that made me happy.
- But...

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:32.663
Same.

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:36.833
(While So Hyun is opening up
about her feelings to Sang Hyeon)

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:39.063
I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.

00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:41.473
I really want to know what we'll be doing.

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:42.873
We'll probably go on a date.

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:44.879
But I want to know

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:46.149
how the date will be decided.

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:47.543
Do we choose directly?

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:49.789
Or is it random?

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:51.283
Which do you prefer?

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:52.913
Choosing directly.

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:55.283
- Choosing yourself?
- Random

00:02:55.883 --> 00:02:57.223
is literally random.

00:02:57.723 --> 00:02:59.159
(Thinking)

00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:02.053
But you could always ask to talk directly.

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:04.239
It doesn't have to be a date.

00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:05.523
Yes, true.

00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:07.163
We can totally talk,

00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:08.709
- but it's better...
- You want the date

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.009
in a more comfy setting

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.709
- to be at a nice place.
- With good food.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.239
Sang Won, weren't you

00:03:13.263 --> 00:03:14.609
going to give me medicine for this?

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.509
- Oh, right.
- Can't you give me one?

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.879
- It's ointment.
- Yes, you don't have it?

00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:20.249
- No, I do. It's upstairs.
- Me too.

00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:21.949
You know what it is, right?

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.489
Are you talking about the dabbing thing?

00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:25.659
You squeeze a little on a
cotton swab or your finger...

00:03:25.683 --> 00:03:26.719
- What?
- And dab it on

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:27.989
- before bed.
- I got something right here too.

00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:29.053
Does it disappear?

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.829
Wait, but keep a poker face.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.669
- It gets better.
- I see.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.069
Apply a thick layer,

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:37.423
- and it absorbs.
- What?

00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:41.793
Sang Won approached me first,

00:03:41.963 --> 00:03:44.963
and asked if we could talk.

00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:47.273
We agreed to talk right then and there.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.709
- I always wanted to talk to you.
- You did?

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:51.079
- How about we talk?
- Okay.

00:03:51.103 --> 00:03:52.303
We've got some time right now.

00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:54.143
On our first day, - Yes?

00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:57.189
- We barely spoke to each other.
- True.

00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:00.613
When you talked with the
others, it piqued my interest.

00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:02.343
I wanted to know what you talked about.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.623
That's why I sent you the
Love QR Code yesterday.

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:07.569
(Realizing)

00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:08.693
Really?

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:10.323
Because

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:13.263
I've been really curious.

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:16.863
You're someone I can't read at all.

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:19.379
It's only natural for me
to find him interesting

00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:21.749
now that he has told
me he's interested in me.

00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:22.949
Anyone would.

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.543
So I want to get to know him more.

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:26.919
It's a grueling schedule, - So

00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:28.513
even for the skin.

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.743
All of the men in my family
wash their faces before bed.

00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:35.453
Where's the drink we made?

00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:36.853
Right, we need to do that.

00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:39.059
- Made what?
- The drink we made.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:42.499
That move is to change the subject to her.

00:04:42.523 --> 00:04:44.039
The memory only the two of them know.

00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:45.539
(Ye Eun and Sang Won...)

00:04:45.563 --> 00:04:47.193
(made makgeolli together.)

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:49.709
Where's the drink we made?

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:50.939
Right, we need to do that.

00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:52.203
- Yes.
- Let's do it right now.

00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:53.979
(Bewildered)

00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:56.103
- Made what?
- The drink we made.

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.179
- The makgeolli we made.
- Really?

00:04:58.203 --> 00:04:59.363
- Nice.
- It slipped my mind.

00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.419
I came down to do that but totally forgot

00:05:01.443 --> 00:05:02.573
because you weren't here.

00:05:03.173 --> 00:05:04.589
You should've called
me over if it was for that.

00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:05.783
Why didn't you?

00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:12.729
No, I came down thinking
about whether I should do it.

00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:13.883
But I was talking to her.

00:05:14.453 --> 00:05:18.493
(Ultimately, Ye Eun successfully
secured time alone with Sang Won.)

00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:21.640
Are you drinking it?

00:05:21.664 --> 00:05:22.863
- Makgeolli.
- We...

00:05:23.563 --> 00:05:25.839
- Let's take a photo of it.
- Went to a makgeolli studio.

00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:27.409
- Okay.
- We made it.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:30.279
But apparently, we have to stir it today.

00:05:30.303 --> 00:05:33.049
- I had no idea.
- That makgeolli is really special.

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:34.089
I agree.

00:05:34.113 --> 00:05:36.389
(Pink Princess and Puppy,
the names they gave each other)

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:38.083
Do I just stir it?

00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:39.220
(Laughing)

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:40.489
- Like...
- What did the instructor say?

00:05:40.513 --> 00:05:41.913
To stir it diligently.

00:05:42.753 --> 00:05:44.123
I'll give it a go.

00:05:45.153 --> 00:05:46.353
Give what a go?

00:05:46.683 --> 00:05:47.999
- Are you going to shake it?
- Yes.

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:49.399
What if it bursts open?

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:50.939
(Ye Eun naturally puts her hand on top.)

00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:51.963
No, like this.

00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:54.393
Oh, no.

00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:57.603
(I'll grab my own hand.)

00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:59.333
(Grabbing)

00:05:59.863 --> 00:06:01.373
(Surprised)

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:02.979
Is it okay?

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:04.773
(Her hands are frozen.)

00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:08.113
It's not mixing at all.

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.189
(Shaking)

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:11.283
You're right.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:13.159
- I can't use it.
- How cute.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:15.029
Nothing fits.

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:16.213
(Ye Eun finds Sang Won cute.)

00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:17.959
- Puppy.
- It's working.

00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:19.053
Is it?

00:06:19.623 --> 00:06:20.969
It's nice

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:22.429
- how the two have...
- Done.

00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:24.393
- Something to talk about.
- Exactly.

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:25.923
- Wash your hands.
- Wait.

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.509
I have to pat it.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:28.709
(Patting)

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:29.833
Make sure to turn out well.

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:32.509
- Become delicious.
- Delicious.

00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:33.839
It's as if everyone

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:36.273
has gone back to when
they had their first date.

00:06:38.473 --> 00:06:40.719
(Ji Yung has come upstairs alone.)

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:41.720
(Glancing at So Hyun's room)

00:06:41.744 --> 00:06:42.873
So Hyun's room?

00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:46.489
(Setting up snacks and wine glasses...)

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.013
(in an empty living room)

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.623
(Looking around)

00:06:53.783 --> 00:06:55.593
Who is he waiting for?

00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:59.123
It's So Hyun.

00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:00.869
I want to talk to her more.

00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:02.963
I want to get to know her better.

00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:04.763
That's what I want to do.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.033
(After the glamping date)

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:09.533
It's

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:12.203
kind of cute when you get flustered.

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:16.543
(Ji Yung's feelings for So
Hyun have grown bigger.)

00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:18.389
(Ji Yung, who kept hesitating, )

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:19.959
Just call her out.

00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:22.559
(heads toward So Hyun's room.)

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:23.560
(Knocking)

00:07:23.584 --> 00:07:24.623
Yes?

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:26.729
- Ji Yung.
- Yes.

00:07:26.753 --> 00:07:27.923
Why are you here?

00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:29.270
(Flustered)

00:07:29.294 --> 00:07:30.353
It's nothing.

00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:32.500
Did he leave because So Hyun

00:07:32.524 --> 00:07:33.563
- isn't there?
- Yes.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.309
I was just about to ask

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:37.563
if we could talk.

00:07:37.803 --> 00:07:38.979
Go and ask now.

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:40.833
- Yes, go now.
- Should I?

00:07:42.273 --> 00:07:45.343
(Is So Hyun over here?)

00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:48.243
(Looking around)

00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:51.759
Are you looking for someone?

00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:53.189
- No.
- I see.

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:54.313
Can we talk,

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:57.483
- for a minute?
- Sure.

00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:05.963
I feel like we don't have much time,

00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:08.963
and I've always wanted

00:08:09.163 --> 00:08:10.509
to talk to you.

00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:11.563
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:13.763
Shall we go to my room?

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:16.679
- What about...
- If it's not cold,

00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:18.843
- how about the terrace?
- Yes, I'm in.

00:08:22.813 --> 00:08:24.919
(Of all people)

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:25.920
What?

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:28.189
- That was when they were talking.
- What?

00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:29.359
How did that happen?

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:30.743
- What...
- How could that happen?

00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:33.829
(So Hyun, whom Ji Yung was looking for, )

00:08:33.853 --> 00:08:35.693
(and Sang Hyeon are on the terrace.)

00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:36.870
I'm sorry.

00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:38.463
- Sorry.
- And his shoe came off.

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:41.433
I'm sorry. Let's go
somewhere else. Not good.

00:08:41.863 --> 00:08:43.939
- He said, "Not good."
- I feel bad for Ji Yung.

00:08:43.963 --> 00:08:45.003
He's all flustered.

00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:47.509
(Laughing)

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:50.179
What was that? People rarely come here.

00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:51.279
- Really?
- This spot

00:08:51.303 --> 00:08:52.423
has suddenly become popular.

00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:54.343
To think they'd meet there.

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:55.913
- Was someone there?
- Yes.

00:08:56.043 --> 00:08:57.613
Why don't we go over here?

00:08:58.113 --> 00:09:00.843
- There's another terrace.
- I feel bad for Ji Yung.

00:09:01.513 --> 00:09:03.683
- Are you not cold?
- No, I'm fine.

00:09:04.553 --> 00:09:07.023
It was bad timing in many ways.

00:09:07.183 --> 00:09:08.799
Ji Yung won't be able to focus anymore.

00:09:08.823 --> 00:09:11.263
Exactly. At least he found So Hyun.

00:09:11.493 --> 00:09:12.663
For real.

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:14.309
- He found where she was.
- He found her.

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:15.333
You're right.

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.339
Here.

00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:21.309
(Ji Won and Ji Yung
talk on the other terrace.)

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.549
It'd be great if we got a
chance to go on a date,

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:26.679
but it didn't seem like we had much time.

00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:28.943
- So...
- They didn't have many chances.

00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:33.243
You being full of confidence

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:36.689
is charming,

00:09:36.713 --> 00:09:38.683
and it'd be a bummer
if I didn't talk to you.

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:40.283
- She's very straightforward.
- Yes.

00:09:40.483 --> 00:09:43.053
What's your ideal type of woman?

00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:45.239
(Ji Won asked about Ji Yung's
ideal type when he joined.)

00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:48.793
Someone who is proud of her job.

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.209
(I want to talk to Ji Yung.)

00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:53.363
Do you like to run?

00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:54.849
I do.

00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:56.479
Really? How about a run tomorrow?

00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.273
- May I join?
- Sure.

00:09:58.703 --> 00:10:00.803
Who do you want to go on a date with today?

00:10:01.373 --> 00:10:02.373
I'd like

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:04.313
to go with Ji Yung.

00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:07.143
- I want to talk to him.
- Is that so?

00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:11.183
I wasn't sure how to
strike up a conversation.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.299
But there weren't many situations

00:10:13.323 --> 00:10:14.993
- where I could talk to you.
- I see.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.393
That's why...

00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:19.599
Only when I tell you in person
that I'm interested in you

00:10:19.623 --> 00:10:21.993
will you realize it.

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:24.979
And I'd be able to hear about

00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:28.103
- your feelings.
- Hear about it. I see.

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:31.573
First off, I'm sure

00:10:31.743 --> 00:10:34.289
it must've been hard, but
thank you for telling me first.

00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:36.273
- No, of course.
- I'm serious.

00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:39.813
But

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:43.183
- when I talked...
- Yes?

00:10:43.983 --> 00:10:45.353
To So Hyun today, - Yes?

00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:49.993
We clicked really well.

00:10:51.423 --> 00:10:53.523
To say it like that?

00:10:53.593 --> 00:10:56.863
Out of all the people I've met until now,

00:10:57.463 --> 00:11:00.803
I was surprised at how well we
could keep a conversation going.

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:02.579
- It was really nice.
- I see.

00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:04.963
- You found her very charming.
- I found her very charming.

00:11:05.573 --> 00:11:07.373
- If I'm being honest.
- Right.

00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:10.813
What's crossing my mind
right now is that I want...

00:11:11.043 --> 00:11:13.159
- You want to focus on her.
- To focus on So Hyun.

00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:14.583
It really hit me today.

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:18.559
I felt this certainty today.

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:19.759
(Ji Yung is being honest
about his feelings.)

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:21.653
So you've made up your mind.

00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:24.293
Yes, it seems like it.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:26.163
I get it.

00:11:26.863 --> 00:11:27.969
(Embarrassed)

00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:28.993
Thank you.

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:31.303
It's nothing to thank me about.

00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:34.303
You just told me about your feelings.

00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:36.203
That's why I'm thanking you.

00:11:36.703 --> 00:11:39.279
I know it must not have been easy,
but you told me about your feelings.

00:11:39.303 --> 00:11:43.013
But this is something for myself as well.

00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:46.583
Either way, if I hadn't talked to you,

00:11:47.283 --> 00:11:48.929
I would've regretted it.

00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:51.659
Then I would've regretted
the time I spent here.

00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:54.669
- True.
- "I should've talked to Ji Yung."

00:11:54.693 --> 00:11:56.469
I didn't want to have that regret,

00:11:56.493 --> 00:11:58.499
so I'm glad I asked to talk

00:11:58.523 --> 00:11:59.669
- to you today.
- I see.

00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:01.109
(Ji Won doesn't want to leave any regrets.)

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:04.539
I can't help but wonder if he had to be

00:12:04.563 --> 00:12:06.939
that clear with his answer.

00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:10.933
Couldn't he have just expressed
his gratitude for her feelings,

00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:14.523
- and ended the conversation there?
- Yes. After hearing how she felt

00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:16.243
- "I see."
- "Thank you."

00:12:16.843 --> 00:12:19.389
It's not like Ji Won asked him out.

00:12:19.413 --> 00:12:21.989
As a third party, it's
heartbreaking to watch.

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:24.723
But it was a healthy
conversation, wasn't it?

00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:26.829
They expressed their feelings.

00:12:26.853 --> 00:12:29.529
And the two did so

00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.069
in an honest-to-goodness way.

00:12:31.093 --> 00:12:34.393
I personally think it was a rash call.

00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:36.193
"I'm certain about So Hyun."

00:12:36.593 --> 00:12:38.109
Saying that to someone.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.279
Exactly. That's what makes me...

00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:43.649
Imagine if things don't work
out with So Hyun in the end.

00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:44.833
I don't think it'll work out.

00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:46.279
(Laughing)

00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:49.273
You saw the two of them
during the swimming pool date.

00:12:49.343 --> 00:12:51.489
So Hyun's expression is totally different.

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:52.713
When she looks at Ji Yung,

00:12:53.643 --> 00:12:55.583
it's like, "What a cute guy."

00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:58.629
But when she looks at Sang Hyeon,

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.493
her face is like a fully bloomed flower.

00:13:02.453 --> 00:13:03.893
This is tough.

00:13:04.153 --> 00:13:05.963
(Oh, no. What now?)

00:13:06.563 --> 00:13:11.433
(Mu Jin has come downstairs
to the older women's floor.)

00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:15.733
Can I come in?

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:17.233
I'll head outside.

00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:22.913
(Mu Jin asks to see Bon Hee privately.)

00:13:23.013 --> 00:13:24.119
Can we go outside?

00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:25.983
- How about we take a walk outside?
- Sure.

00:13:26.883 --> 00:13:28.253
Or outside over there?

00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:30.753
Outside over there? You mean outside here?

00:13:31.183 --> 00:13:32.199
Sure.

00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:33.783
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin decide to talk.)

00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:37.323
Did you eat something?

00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:40.239
Earlier, when I watched the match,

00:13:40.263 --> 00:13:41.509
I got all nervous myself.

00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:42.510
(Laughing)

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:44.703
- You couldn't eat? Really?
- I'm serious.

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:46.533
Yes, I got nervous.

00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:48.079
Honestly, it was tough.

00:13:48.103 --> 00:13:50.533
Right? I didn't expect you to be that good.

00:13:51.003 --> 00:13:52.173
I was really surprised.

00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:57.713
I worked hard to go on a date with you.

00:13:57.943 --> 00:13:59.043
I know.

00:14:02.253 --> 00:14:04.153
Come to think of it, - Yes?

00:14:05.723 --> 00:14:08.929
Our first date happened
because of the card.

00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:11.193
- Our second date was the bus date.
- The bus date.

00:14:13.123 --> 00:14:15.693
I wanted to go on our next date quickly.

00:14:16.463 --> 00:14:17.633
That's what I thought.

00:14:18.163 --> 00:14:20.333
But things haven't been working out.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.409
They only had two dates.

00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:24.479
It's a lot less than I expected.

00:14:24.503 --> 00:14:26.403
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin only had two dates.)

00:14:26.773 --> 00:14:29.173
Have you talked to the others?

00:14:30.213 --> 00:14:31.419
I have.

00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:33.589
Once with Ji Yung. And
I've talked with Sang Hyeon.

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:35.459
- Who?
- Sang Hyeon.

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:36.683
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:41.269
I was fond of Bon Hee

00:14:41.293 --> 00:14:43.323
from the get-go.

00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:49.439
(Sang Hyeon had a
private talk with Bon Hee.)

00:14:49.463 --> 00:14:52.639
Mu Jin knows Bon Hee and
Sang Hyeon have talked

00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:56.603
after Sang Hyeon
declared war during the day.

00:14:57.073 --> 00:14:58.243
It bothered me.

00:15:00.403 --> 00:15:01.389
And I've talked with Sang Hyeon.

00:15:01.413 --> 00:15:03.449
- Who?
- Sang Hyeon.

00:15:03.473 --> 00:15:04.783
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.643
- Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon.

00:15:08.313 --> 00:15:09.559
You know who it is, right?

00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:10.813
- Sang Won and...
- I do.

00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:12.883
Sang Hyeon and I talked.

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:17.769
You two didn't go on a date, right?

00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:19.263
No, we only talked.

00:15:19.393 --> 00:15:21.163
(Thinking)

00:15:24.603 --> 00:15:26.243
Who else do you want to get to know more?

00:15:26.733 --> 00:15:27.973
Get to know more?

00:15:33.043 --> 00:15:34.573
- Get to know more?
- Yes.

00:15:37.243 --> 00:15:39.083
(Feeling nervous)

00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:49.723
(Bon Hee can't answer him easily.)

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:57.633
- I've wanted to tell you this.
- What?

00:15:57.863 --> 00:15:59.333
When I had just joined,

00:16:00.803 --> 00:16:03.603
the only person I was interested
in from the first impression I got

00:16:04.403 --> 00:16:06.003
was you.

00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:11.743
I believe I was lucky.

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.883
- How so?
- It's just...

00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:17.213
When you came to the coffee shop.

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:20.623
Our first date.

00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:25.923
It's because I believe in it.

00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:27.623
Do you believe in fate?

00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:31.833
I believe fate exists.

00:16:33.203 --> 00:16:34.303
Yes.

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:38.449
You liking my first impression

00:16:38.473 --> 00:16:40.243
- the most.
- Yes?

00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:44.573
You choosing my card.

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:46.983
And coming to the coffee shop.

00:16:48.183 --> 00:16:49.783
All of them feel like fate to me.

00:16:55.553 --> 00:16:56.593
That's why

00:16:58.223 --> 00:17:00.769
if things

00:17:00.793 --> 00:17:04.109
go well with someone here,

00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:07.863
I want us to see each other for
longer once we leave this place.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.033
I'm wishing that would be great.

00:17:13.543 --> 00:17:15.543
Honestly, I love

00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:17.949
how we can focus on

00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:19.583
that person themselves while we're here.

00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:22.489
Outside, if anyone had been a lot younger,

00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:24.289
I don't know if I could've done all of this.

00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:26.923
I wouldn't have accepted the blind date.

00:17:27.323 --> 00:17:28.853
If it were a blind date, I mean.

00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:32.399
I wouldn't have felt this
way if we were outside.

00:17:32.423 --> 00:17:34.023
- I may have liked you, though.
- Right.

00:17:34.523 --> 00:17:36.133
- I would have.
- But you wouldn't...

00:17:40.103 --> 00:17:41.333
That's why I'm also curious.

00:17:41.803 --> 00:17:43.533
I wonder if I'll change my mind

00:17:43.873 --> 00:17:46.903
if our age gap is too big.

00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:48.813
I'm not sure.

00:17:49.813 --> 00:17:51.243
At the moment,

00:17:53.043 --> 00:17:54.923
I don't care too much
about our age difference.

00:17:55.453 --> 00:17:58.859
We're talking and dating

00:17:58.883 --> 00:18:01.723
without considering that.

00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:07.763
(Mu Jin told Bon Hee his honest feelings.)

00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:09.739
Mu Jin is impressive.

00:18:09.763 --> 00:18:10.969
He's so cool.

00:18:10.993 --> 00:18:12.109
- I love that guy.
- He's straightforward.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.509
I love him.

00:18:13.533 --> 00:18:14.879
- You love him?
- Yes.

00:18:14.903 --> 00:18:16.249
- Because he's consistent.
- Mu Jin

00:18:16.273 --> 00:18:18.379
I'm also in love with him now.

00:18:18.403 --> 00:18:20.573
Isn't he the type of guy
that every girl wants?

00:18:20.673 --> 00:18:21.813
- Definitely.
- Right?

00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:24.843
But Mu Jin... He's laughing at me again.

00:18:25.943 --> 00:18:26.959
Why?

00:18:26.983 --> 00:18:28.889
- She's like, "My Mu Jin!"
- "My Mu Jin!"

00:18:28.913 --> 00:18:30.553
"Mu Jin, you're amazing!"

00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:32.999
These two are the
president and vice-president

00:18:33.023 --> 00:18:34.753
of Mu Jin's fan club.

00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:38.569
Mu Jin must feel rushed now.

00:18:38.593 --> 00:18:39.623
Right.

00:18:39.763 --> 00:18:42.809
But he was leaning back like this.

00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:43.810
(Almost possessed by Mu Jin)

00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:45.403
Are you curious about anyone else?

00:18:45.703 --> 00:18:46.680
(Here he goes again.)

00:18:46.704 --> 00:18:49.379
And we often say, "We got lucky."

00:18:49.403 --> 00:18:50.673
- "We got lucky."
- Right.

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.649
But that sounded like
a love confession to me.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:55.119
- Right.
- "We got lucky" sounds all right.

00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:57.673
But I'm not sure about fate.

00:18:57.873 --> 00:18:59.583
(I like it, though.)

00:19:00.643 --> 00:19:04.059
(The night when honest feelings
were exchanged has passed, )

00:19:04.083 --> 00:19:07.223
(and morning has dawned.)

00:19:07.853 --> 00:19:11.569
(Bon Hee is getting dolled
up early in the morning.)

00:19:11.593 --> 00:19:14.123
(Applying)

00:19:23.073 --> 00:19:25.143
- Who's that? I think it's So Hyun.
- It's So Hyun.

00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:30.173
(Moaning)

00:19:31.313 --> 00:19:34.883
(So Hyun starts the day by stretching.)

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:36.759
(Lifting)

00:19:36.783 --> 00:19:37.789
She's flexible.

00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:39.523
That's a great sunlight.

00:19:41.023 --> 00:19:42.353
(Picking them up)

00:19:42.953 --> 00:19:45.939
(After stretching, )

00:19:45.963 --> 00:19:49.209
(she returns to her room.)

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:50.593
This is the base.

00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:53.433
I hope everyone goes

00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:56.103
on a date with the person they want.

00:19:56.773 --> 00:19:58.943
How was talking to Sang Hyeon last night?

00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:01.843
Last night... Yes, let's talk about that.

00:20:02.073 --> 00:20:03.143
I want to know.

00:20:04.273 --> 00:20:08.483
(She tells Bon Hee about
the talk with Sang Hyeon.)

00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:10.853
He just told me everything honestly.

00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:14.653
He was actually interested in you at first.

00:20:14.823 --> 00:20:17.499
Then, I started expressing my interest,

00:20:17.523 --> 00:20:22.369
so he said he'd keep me in mind

00:20:22.393 --> 00:20:23.933
while he stays here.

00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:27.863
He's so cute.

00:20:27.963 --> 00:20:30.303
He's so thoughtful.

00:20:31.403 --> 00:20:32.779
But

00:20:32.803 --> 00:20:35.043
I'm not sure what's on Bon Hee's mind.

00:20:39.543 --> 00:20:42.059
(Ji Won is up.)

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.783
Good morning.

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.523
Did the talk go well last night?

00:20:46.623 --> 00:20:48.159
Yes, it did.

00:20:48.183 --> 00:20:49.983
(Now, she hears about
the chat with Ji Yung.)

00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:51.393
You know,

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.793
I told him that I wanted
to get to know him.

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:58.833
But he said he was
interested in someone else.

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:00.603
- That's what he said?
- Yes.

00:21:00.703 --> 00:21:03.333
And you don't want to take another shot?

00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:07.443
He said he only sets eyes on one person.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:11.143
He politely rejected me.

00:21:11.513 --> 00:21:12.559
Really?

00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:14.119
"Politely rejected."

00:21:14.143 --> 00:21:15.983
But who knows what will happen?

00:21:16.353 --> 00:21:17.413
Right.

00:21:20.953 --> 00:21:24.093
I think her timing was bad.

00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:28.933
(Older women, please come
to the Secret Room one by one.)

00:21:30.693 --> 00:21:33.279
(Today, the older women
will pick their dates.)

00:21:33.303 --> 00:21:34.403
The older women will pick.

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.349
(Memory Location Date)

00:21:38.373 --> 00:21:39.350
"Memory Location?"

00:21:39.374 --> 00:21:44.149
(Put a photo of a memory of yours...)

00:21:44.173 --> 00:21:49.083
(into the drawer of the
younger man you want to date.)

00:21:51.753 --> 00:21:52.983
Are they old photos?

00:21:53.223 --> 00:21:54.969
She looks good in long hair too.

00:21:54.993 --> 00:21:56.029
(The older women's stories
they want to tell the younger men)

00:21:56.053 --> 00:21:57.030
(Ye Eun)

00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:58.693
Ye Eun was so cute!

00:21:58.793 --> 00:22:01.063
That was her in high school?

00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:04.309
So Hyun is so cute.

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.579
(The older women invite the younger men...)

00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:07.109
(to their memorable places.)

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:08.179
Ji Won.

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:10.579
(Ji Won)

00:22:10.603 --> 00:22:11.580
(Yeong Gyeong)

00:22:11.604 --> 00:22:12.903
Yeong Gyeong.

00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:17.019
(The younger men are
gathered in a room at the time.)

00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:18.043
Maybe.

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:20.943
That's mine.

00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:26.783
(Mu Jin, go to the Secret
Room and see who your date is.)

00:22:27.553 --> 00:22:29.653
(Grinning)

00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:33.793
- What is it?
- Why did you smile?

00:22:34.263 --> 00:22:36.369
- He did that on purpose.
- Is it good news?

00:22:36.393 --> 00:22:38.539
(The younger men are stirred
by the most insignificant actions.)

00:22:38.563 --> 00:22:39.863
I want to know too.

00:22:40.363 --> 00:22:41.563
I'm dying to know.

00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:43.749
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

00:22:43.773 --> 00:22:44.909
(Mu Jin excitedly goes to the Secret Room.)

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:47.573
- We must be going down one by one.
- Are we getting chosen again?

00:22:47.603 --> 00:22:49.419
(The younger men are nervous...)

00:22:49.443 --> 00:22:51.549
(as they don't know what's happening.)

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:54.159
What if one of them doesn't get chosen?

00:22:54.183 --> 00:22:55.889
(Another one left behind?)

00:22:55.913 --> 00:22:58.829
- Sang Won.
- I was thinking it,

00:22:58.853 --> 00:23:00.229
- but I couldn't say it out loud.
- Sang Won or

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.599
I think it's Sang Won.

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:03.499
(Sang Won, the name
that everyone was thinking)

00:23:03.523 --> 00:23:05.563
What if he gets zero votes again?

00:23:05.793 --> 00:23:07.273
Are we getting into their cars again?

00:23:07.993 --> 00:23:10.733
(Mu Jin heads to the Secret Room.)

00:23:12.803 --> 00:23:15.273
(There's a card in front of him.)

00:23:15.373 --> 00:23:17.109
(There is a photo containing
the memories of the older women.)

00:23:17.133 --> 00:23:19.049
(Open your own drawer,
and if there is a photo, )

00:23:19.073 --> 00:23:21.393
(go to the location in the photo
and create a new memory.)

00:23:22.273 --> 00:23:27.543
(Will there be a photo in Mu Jin's drawer?)

00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:28.583
(Mu Jin)

00:23:28.688 --> 00:23:33.294
(Will there be a photo in Mu Jin's drawer?)

00:23:33.354 --> 00:23:34.824
(Mu Jin)

00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:39.864
(There's a photo for Mu Jin.)

00:23:40.064 --> 00:23:42.404
(Staring)

00:23:43.574 --> 00:23:49.544
(Who's the woman in the
photo inside his drawer?)

00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:55.184
(The second younger man, Sang Won)

00:23:55.884 --> 00:23:57.054
(Is he knocking?)

00:23:58.814 --> 00:23:59.854
Sang Won.

00:24:00.624 --> 00:24:02.460
Sang Won is...

00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:03.530
(He's not familiar with this room, )

00:24:03.554 --> 00:24:04.970
(so he has to knock.)

00:24:04.994 --> 00:24:07.094
Oh, it's his first time coming here.

00:24:07.264 --> 00:24:09.870
(Only the ones with the
most Love QR messages...)

00:24:09.894 --> 00:24:11.894
(were allowed in this room until now.)

00:24:13.604 --> 00:24:15.404
(Looking around)

00:24:17.104 --> 00:24:18.874
(Focused)

00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:20.680
You're expecting him to
get zero votes, aren't you?

00:24:20.704 --> 00:24:23.274
No, I'm not. No!

00:24:23.544 --> 00:24:26.414
I could sense how intrigued he was.

00:24:26.714 --> 00:24:27.944
(It feels hot.)

00:24:29.084 --> 00:24:32.654
(He sees his drawer for the first time.)

00:24:34.884 --> 00:24:35.900
- Please.
- Please.

00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:37.830
(Will there be a photo in the drawer...)

00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:39.770
(that he's opening for the first time?)

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:40.870
There is!

00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:41.894
What?

00:24:44.064 --> 00:24:46.194
(There are two photos?)

00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:47.980
- What? There are two photos!
- Two photos?

00:24:48.004 --> 00:24:50.734
(There are two photos?)

00:24:51.334 --> 00:24:52.934
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

00:24:53.104 --> 00:24:54.081
You can still do it, Sang Won.

00:24:54.105 --> 00:24:55.880
Look how big his eyes have gotten.

00:24:55.904 --> 00:24:59.190
I was very flustered

00:24:59.214 --> 00:25:02.644
because I had never imagined it.

00:25:04.114 --> 00:25:05.784
I was surprised.

00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:07.784
He's like, "Are these really for me?"

00:25:09.724 --> 00:25:13.764
(Sang Won, who had 0 votes,
was chosen by 2 older women.)

00:25:14.964 --> 00:25:17.770
(There are 2 photos
and 3 younger men left.)

00:25:17.794 --> 00:25:19.370
Then, one of them isn't getting a photo.

00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:21.704
(There are 2 photos
and 3 younger men left.)

00:25:23.204 --> 00:25:26.250
(The third younger man to open
the door to the Secret Room)

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:29.004
(Hyeon Jun)

00:25:30.514 --> 00:25:32.844
I hope that it's Yeong Gyeong,

00:25:34.214 --> 00:25:36.384
but I'm not sure how she feels.

00:25:37.914 --> 00:25:39.754
(Do you want to go on a date with me?)

00:25:40.254 --> 00:25:43.894
(He kept showing his
feelings for Yeong Gyeong.)

00:25:44.894 --> 00:25:46.500
(But she didn't choose him back.)

00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:49.124
I don't think she's interested
in Hyeon Jun anymore.

00:25:50.664 --> 00:25:54.080
(Will there be her photo in his drawer?)

00:25:54.104 --> 00:25:55.134
What?

00:25:56.004 --> 00:25:57.004
What?

00:25:58.834 --> 00:26:00.080
It must be empty.

00:26:00.104 --> 00:26:01.280
(His drawer is...)

00:26:01.304 --> 00:26:02.280
(empty.)

00:26:02.304 --> 00:26:03.304
There's nothing.

00:26:05.144 --> 00:26:09.960
(He looks around the empty
drawer as if he can't believe it.)

00:26:09.984 --> 00:26:13.384
Please don't break the drawer, Hyeon Jun.

00:26:13.824 --> 00:26:15.060
He can't believe it.

00:26:15.084 --> 00:26:16.154
(Is it really empty?)

00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:19.694
He's very surprised.

00:26:20.294 --> 00:26:25.064
(He wasn't chosen by anyone.)

00:26:25.264 --> 00:26:28.004
I was disappointed.

00:26:33.774 --> 00:26:34.820
Ji Yung.

00:26:34.844 --> 00:26:37.844
(The fourth younger man, Ji Yung)

00:26:41.084 --> 00:26:43.784
(Opening)

00:26:45.584 --> 00:26:47.084
- What?
- It's empty.

00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:50.624
(He fiddles with the camera.)

00:26:51.024 --> 00:26:52.894
(What?)

00:26:54.794 --> 00:26:56.500
- Ji Yung is so funny.
- You laughed too hard.

00:26:56.524 --> 00:26:58.244
He put his hand in as if there was a photo.

00:26:59.194 --> 00:27:00.680
Did I laugh too hard?

00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:03.204
I mean, look at his face!

00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:04.974
I feel so bad for him.

00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:07.704
(Puzzled)

00:27:09.874 --> 00:27:14.644
(Ji Yung also wasn't chosen by anyone.)

00:27:15.714 --> 00:27:17.814
I did see it coming, though.

00:27:18.084 --> 00:27:19.260
He said he saw it coming.

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:21.554
Stop lying! You didn't look like you did.

00:27:22.284 --> 00:27:24.454
So Hyun has recently joined us,

00:27:25.094 --> 00:27:26.530
and even I would have

00:27:26.554 --> 00:27:29.164
wanted to have a talk with others.

00:27:30.364 --> 00:27:32.334
I'll keep trying

00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:35.664
to showcase my strengths,

00:27:36.164 --> 00:27:38.404
and my attractiveness.

00:27:39.834 --> 00:27:41.804
Do you know why life is all about timing?

00:27:42.144 --> 00:27:44.574
If Ji Won

00:27:44.944 --> 00:27:47.984
hadn't said a word to Ji Yung yesterday,

00:27:48.484 --> 00:27:51.314
and picked her date today,

00:27:51.554 --> 00:27:53.584
Ji Yung would have gone on a date with her.

00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:57.130
Then, she would have
been able to take her time,

00:27:57.154 --> 00:27:59.154
and charm him in a new place.

00:27:59.654 --> 00:28:01.000
But she felt so rushed

00:28:01.024 --> 00:28:03.094
when she saw Ji Yung looking for So Hyun.

00:28:03.694 --> 00:28:06.234
She went, "Let's have a chat. I like you."

00:28:06.594 --> 00:28:07.880
"But I like someone else."

00:28:07.904 --> 00:28:08.934
"Okay."

00:28:09.364 --> 00:28:11.204
That's how it ended.

00:28:11.874 --> 00:28:13.080
(Jumping up and down as she's upset)

00:28:13.104 --> 00:28:14.350
I think you need to take your time

00:28:14.374 --> 00:28:15.780
in Yeon House.

00:28:15.804 --> 00:28:18.220
On the other hand, Sang
Won is even more confused.

00:28:18.244 --> 00:28:19.790
(He must be very confused.)

00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:20.884
I'm so happy for him.

00:28:22.814 --> 00:28:23.930
There's Sang Hyeon.

00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:24.954
(Impressed)

00:28:25.514 --> 00:28:27.060
(Amazed)

00:28:27.084 --> 00:28:29.654
(The last younger guy is Sang Hyeon.)

00:28:31.354 --> 00:28:33.234
It's also his first time
coming into this room.

00:28:33.894 --> 00:28:36.270
Oh, it's his first time.

00:28:36.294 --> 00:28:38.534
(He carefully reads the instructions.)

00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:41.404
If I have a photo?

00:28:42.334 --> 00:28:47.004
(Whose photo does he want to see?)

00:28:47.774 --> 00:28:50.274
If I get a chance to go
on a date with Bon Hee,

00:28:50.574 --> 00:28:52.750
or if she says,

00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:54.344
"I'd like to go on a date with you..."

00:28:54.484 --> 00:28:55.744
"As we've never gone together,"

00:28:56.384 --> 00:28:58.914
and we get to go,

00:28:59.414 --> 00:29:00.954
I'd be more than happy.

00:29:02.954 --> 00:29:06.594
(Will there be Bon Hee's photo?)

00:29:07.224 --> 00:29:10.224
(A photo comes out of his drawer.)

00:29:12.364 --> 00:29:13.434
Two photos.

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.764
(Laughing)

00:29:22.074 --> 00:29:24.620
(He got 2 photos, but none
of them was Bon Hee's.)

00:29:24.644 --> 00:29:25.744
Poor him.

00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:31.954
I can tell for sure

00:29:32.614 --> 00:29:34.324
that they're both into each other.

00:29:34.824 --> 00:29:36.464
I don't think they'll change their minds.

00:29:39.654 --> 00:29:40.840
Bon Hee...

00:29:40.864 --> 00:29:42.900
(Bon Hee...)

00:29:42.924 --> 00:29:44.310
I think he should let her go, right?

00:29:44.334 --> 00:29:45.664
I think he should.

00:29:46.194 --> 00:29:48.180
I'm going to need some
time to clear my mind.

00:29:48.204 --> 00:29:51.234
(I'm going to need some
time to clear my mind.)

00:29:52.434 --> 00:29:54.020
(He has come to definitely know...)

00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:56.574
(Bon Hee's feelings
through today's choice.)

00:29:57.344 --> 00:29:59.720
(Will he have a change of heart...)

00:29:59.744 --> 00:30:03.414
(after today's date?)

00:30:04.154 --> 00:30:06.884
Do you think Bon Hee

00:30:07.584 --> 00:30:11.124
will change her mind just
because Sang Hyeon tries?

00:30:11.354 --> 00:30:13.124
- I don't think so.
- I agree.

00:30:13.324 --> 00:30:15.540
He could let go of his pride and ask her,

00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.224
for a second chat,

00:30:17.364 --> 00:30:19.140
but I bet he'll stop asking,

00:30:19.164 --> 00:30:20.240
for her sake.

00:30:20.264 --> 00:30:22.764
- You're right.
- It'd be too much pressure for her.

00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:26.080
That's how you can tell
that he actually cares for her.

00:30:26.104 --> 00:30:27.604
- Exactly.
- If he does care for her.

00:30:29.404 --> 00:30:36.084
(The older women are waiting
at the memorable places.)

00:30:39.314 --> 00:30:42.000
(The younger men are headed toward them...)

00:30:42.024 --> 00:30:45.194
(half-excited and half-nervous.)

00:30:47.594 --> 00:30:49.200
The younger men are on the move.

00:30:49.224 --> 00:30:51.064
(How will their Memory Location Date go?)

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:54.840
(A place that feels special for
no reason, an amusement park)

00:30:54.864 --> 00:30:58.034
It's an amusement park.
Which woman is waiting?

00:30:58.374 --> 00:31:00.210
It's been so long since I last went to one.

00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:05.274
(One older woman is waiting there.)

00:31:07.484 --> 00:31:10.590
(A younger man walks in.)

00:31:10.614 --> 00:31:11.714
It's Sang Hyeon.

00:31:12.484 --> 00:31:14.024
(He spots her.)

00:31:14.584 --> 00:31:16.654
I was expecting someone to pick me

00:31:17.024 --> 00:31:20.554
if the women get to choose.

00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:23.400
(The 1st photo of the
2 photos in his drawer)

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:25.494
- That's obviously So Hyun.
- How adorable.

00:31:26.464 --> 00:31:28.664
So Hyun looks beautiful today.

00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:31.974
I went there often with my
parents when I was little.

00:31:32.234 --> 00:31:34.574
I also worked part-time
there, and I often visited,

00:31:35.004 --> 00:31:37.774
for my outside activities,
so it's very memorable.

00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:39.344
She's so cute today.

00:31:41.884 --> 00:31:44.684
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon)

00:31:45.254 --> 00:31:46.784
(Smiling brightly)

00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:49.454
He looks so happy.

00:31:49.724 --> 00:31:51.024
Hello.

00:31:51.554 --> 00:31:53.800
- You must have waited long.
- It's fine.

00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:54.801
- Should we...
- Why are you sitting?

00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.694
- We shouldn't sit.
- Why are you sitting?

00:31:57.394 --> 00:31:58.534
Sorry.

00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:01.440
It took me too long to pick an outfit.

00:32:01.464 --> 00:32:03.210
- It took a while.
- Picking took you long?

00:32:03.234 --> 00:32:04.750
Yes, I was picking my outfit.

00:32:04.774 --> 00:32:05.874
- Oh, your clothes?
- Yes.

00:32:06.334 --> 00:32:07.674
You picked the right one.

00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:09.704
(Shy)

00:32:11.174 --> 00:32:13.254
Where are we going? Should
we get back to the bench?

00:32:13.674 --> 00:32:15.460
(He turns away from the entrance.)

00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:16.784
(Anxious)

00:32:17.514 --> 00:32:18.960
He was cute.

00:32:18.984 --> 00:32:21.284
He felt like a giant puppy.

00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:22.684
He is cute.

00:32:27.094 --> 00:32:28.840
(It's a day to grow closer to one another.)

00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:31.504
(Please speak casually, including
the way you address each other.)

00:32:31.994 --> 00:32:34.664
They told us to speak
casually during our date.

00:32:36.234 --> 00:32:38.374
- Are you all right with that?
- Let's do that.

00:32:39.974 --> 00:32:40.974
(Shy)

00:32:42.604 --> 00:32:44.150
Oh, it was an order!

00:32:44.174 --> 00:32:45.650
(They're forced to drop the honorifics.)

00:32:45.674 --> 00:32:47.884
- I think they'll get closer.
- Instantly.

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:52.354
I have a fan. Should we use it?

00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:54.654
I brought a fan,

00:32:55.154 --> 00:32:56.260
and a cooling...

00:32:56.284 --> 00:32:58.530
It's awkward to speak in non-honorifics.

00:32:58.554 --> 00:33:00.824
I know, right? Let's just do it.

00:33:01.764 --> 00:33:03.170
(How will their date go...)

00:33:03.194 --> 00:33:04.710
(without the honorifics?)

00:33:04.734 --> 00:33:05.794
Come on.

00:33:07.394 --> 00:33:09.840
It brings back old memories.

00:33:09.864 --> 00:33:11.580
- It's interesting.
- Really? Do you like coming here?

00:33:11.604 --> 00:33:12.850
I do. Animals...

00:33:12.874 --> 00:33:15.550
- Well...
- Do you like the zoo,

00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:17.444
- or the amusement park?
- I like animals.

00:33:17.814 --> 00:33:19.790
So, I liked coming here as
I could see them up close.

00:33:19.814 --> 00:33:21.244
Oh, I see.

00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:24.384
What's your favorite animal?

00:33:24.914 --> 00:33:27.160
These days, quokkas are my favorite.

00:33:27.184 --> 00:33:28.161
Quokkas?

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.930
Is there a quokka headband?

00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:32.930
I want to pick one for you.

00:33:32.954 --> 00:33:35.140
(I want to pick one for you.)

00:33:35.164 --> 00:33:37.340
(Surprised)

00:33:37.364 --> 00:33:39.170
He just dropped the honorifics.

00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:41.404
I like hearing that.

00:33:41.704 --> 00:33:43.880
Using the honorifics or
not makes a big difference.

00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:45.150
- Of course.
- It does.

00:33:45.174 --> 00:33:46.380
(The non-honorifics change
the mood immediately.)

00:33:46.404 --> 00:33:47.381
Quokka

00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:49.350
I want to pick one for you.

00:33:49.374 --> 00:33:52.174
(Flustered)

00:33:52.444 --> 00:33:55.844
He just said, "You,"
without the honorifics.

00:33:56.444 --> 00:33:58.014
I was surprised,

00:33:58.214 --> 00:34:01.654
but I realized how natural he could be.

00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:03.384
I felt

00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:07.154
more intimate all of a sudden.

00:34:07.764 --> 00:34:09.524
Speaking in the non-honorifics to her

00:34:11.294 --> 00:34:12.364
was easy.

00:34:12.464 --> 00:34:15.380
I wasn't hesitant to use it at all.

00:34:15.404 --> 00:34:16.464
I just

00:34:17.004 --> 00:34:19.134
I didn't want to call her "noon a."

00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:25.014
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:34:25.474 --> 00:34:26.820
- We'll take these.
- Hello.

00:34:26.844 --> 00:34:28.460
I'll get rid of the tags right away.

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:29.514
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:34:30.514 --> 00:34:32.330
- I didn't bring my wallet.
- That will be 22 dollars.

00:34:32.354 --> 00:34:33.331
You didn't?

00:34:33.355 --> 00:34:34.854
I didn't bring it at all.

00:34:35.154 --> 00:34:36.330
- He didn't bring his wallet?
- What?

00:34:36.354 --> 00:34:38.000
- What?
- Oh, no.

00:34:38.024 --> 00:34:39.194
(This can't be.)

00:34:39.594 --> 00:34:42.464
(Sang Hyeon forgot to
bring his wallet by mistake.)

00:34:42.564 --> 00:34:43.770
- I...
- How could you leave your wallet

00:34:43.794 --> 00:34:45.194
on a date?

00:34:45.994 --> 00:34:47.170
I...

00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:48.204
(Restless)

00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:51.550
- I'll send you the money.
- That's fine.

00:34:51.574 --> 00:34:53.854
- "I'll send you the money."
- "I'll send you the money."

00:34:54.034 --> 00:34:55.580
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

00:34:55.604 --> 00:34:57.474
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:34:57.974 --> 00:34:59.244
- Hold it for me.
- Okay.

00:34:59.914 --> 00:35:01.260
The older woman bought it for him.

00:35:01.284 --> 00:35:02.760
- I make good money.
- You make good money?

00:35:02.784 --> 00:35:05.060
I can afford this much.

00:35:05.084 --> 00:35:06.360
(He feels bad, so he
tells her that he's capable.)

00:35:06.384 --> 00:35:08.024
- I know.
- Let's go.

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:11.854
It's on me today.

00:35:13.094 --> 00:35:15.194
He didn't bring his wallet to a date?

00:35:15.664 --> 00:35:17.524
Then, the older woman can pay.

00:35:17.634 --> 00:35:20.194
Why would the guy
bring his wallet to a date?

00:35:20.394 --> 00:35:21.680
(In love with her)

00:35:21.704 --> 00:35:23.740
That was a great line just now.

00:35:23.764 --> 00:35:25.650
(A line that would make a
younger guy's heart flutter)

00:35:25.674 --> 00:35:26.810
That was amazing.

00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:29.850
I'd think, "Is he not interested in me?"

00:35:29.874 --> 00:35:31.044
Of course.

00:35:31.374 --> 00:35:35.014
I don't know why Sang
Hyeon is laughing right now,

00:35:35.484 --> 00:35:36.790
but he must feel...

00:35:36.814 --> 00:35:38.790
- He's flustered.
- A lot of mental stress.

00:35:38.814 --> 00:35:40.284
- Right?
- Yes.

00:35:40.884 --> 00:35:41.960
I couldn't agree with him more.

00:35:41.984 --> 00:35:44.000
Obviously,

00:35:44.024 --> 00:35:47.054
she wouldn't be mistaken because of that.

00:35:47.154 --> 00:35:49.670
Say that actually happened to you.

00:35:49.694 --> 00:35:51.664
- Okay.
- What would you do?

00:35:52.064 --> 00:35:53.070
I could say, "I'm so sorry about today."

00:35:53.094 --> 00:35:55.040
"I'll pay for everything on our next date,"

00:35:55.064 --> 00:35:56.580
"so let's go on another date."

00:35:56.604 --> 00:35:58.204
- I like that.
- That's good.

00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:02.680
(The two head to the place in her photo.)

00:36:02.704 --> 00:36:04.104
Should we try it?

00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:05.844
Is it here?

00:36:08.544 --> 00:36:10.290
(The location in So Hyun's photo...)

00:36:10.314 --> 00:36:12.030
It's a trail.

00:36:12.054 --> 00:36:14.190
(is now a trail.)

00:36:14.214 --> 00:36:17.694
But this place is completely

00:36:18.124 --> 00:36:19.630
- I think...
- Did it change?

00:36:19.654 --> 00:36:20.770
There's the pirate ship,

00:36:20.794 --> 00:36:23.200
so it must have been around here.

00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:25.394
(She vaguely remembers
the memorable place.)

00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:27.780
I'll take a photo of you.

00:36:27.804 --> 00:36:29.504
A photo? Here?

00:36:30.704 --> 00:36:31.980
Do you want it to be taken
from a short or long distance?

00:36:32.004 --> 00:36:33.680
(Sang Hyeon wants to help So Hyun
make a good memory as she's sad.)

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:35.620
Take one from a short
distance and another from afar.

00:36:35.644 --> 00:36:36.884
Do I look okay under the shade?

00:36:37.274 --> 00:36:38.754
Yes, you look better under the shade.

00:36:43.214 --> 00:36:45.930
(She poses for a photo at a
place she came to as a little girl.)

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:46.984
She looks cute.

00:36:49.984 --> 00:36:51.754
You're so good at taking photos.

00:36:51.994 --> 00:36:53.354
- I approve.
- It feels rewarding.

00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:55.064
- I approve.
- It feels rewarding.

00:36:55.494 --> 00:36:56.624
You must be feeling hot.

00:36:57.294 --> 00:36:59.664
I sweat easily.

00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:07.274
(So Hyun wipes sweat off his face.)

00:37:09.174 --> 00:37:10.274
It's so hot.

00:37:11.274 --> 00:37:12.754
Can't we have a photo taken together?

00:37:13.374 --> 00:37:14.820
- Shall we do it together?
- Let's take a selfie together.

00:37:14.844 --> 00:37:15.884
Under the shade.

00:37:20.854 --> 00:37:22.960
One, two... Come a
little farther to this side.

00:37:22.984 --> 00:37:24.030
(They take a selfie
together for the first time.)

00:37:24.054 --> 00:37:25.224
One, two, three.

00:37:26.094 --> 00:37:28.140
(Our first photo together taken
at a place in old memories)

00:37:28.164 --> 00:37:29.924
They look great together.

00:37:30.994 --> 00:37:34.264
I came back to the place
where I made good memories.

00:37:35.604 --> 00:37:37.974
And I'm here with the person
I want to be with. It's nice.

00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:40.750
She expressed her feelings
so clearly and explicitly.

00:37:40.774 --> 00:37:42.574
I'm not used to hearing
that kind of comment.

00:37:43.044 --> 00:37:44.050
You took me by surprise.

00:37:44.074 --> 00:37:46.674
(I'm not used to hearing that kind
of comment. You surprised me.)

00:37:48.214 --> 00:37:50.314
Yesterday, after having a chat with you,

00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:53.460
I went back up to the third floor.

00:37:53.484 --> 00:37:55.860
I stayed in my room for a while,

00:37:55.884 --> 00:37:58.100
spending some time calming myself down.

00:37:58.124 --> 00:37:59.324
Oh, my goodness.

00:37:59.624 --> 00:38:01.624
- I was so...
- He's telling her how he felt then.

00:38:02.524 --> 00:38:05.540
(So Hyun told Sang Hyeon
how she felt for him last night.)

00:38:05.564 --> 00:38:08.210
I wanted to talk to you.

00:38:08.234 --> 00:38:09.464
- Really?
- Yes.

00:38:09.934 --> 00:38:10.911
My goodness.

00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:12.780
(So Hyun asked him to talk with
her, which was so unexpected...)

00:38:12.804 --> 00:38:13.780
(that his legs became wobbly.)

00:38:13.804 --> 00:38:14.804
He got that surprised?

00:38:15.404 --> 00:38:17.650
- My goodness.
- He was taken aback.

00:38:17.674 --> 00:38:19.154
He must've been like, "What do I do?"

00:38:19.314 --> 00:38:20.291
I don't know how to put it.

00:38:20.315 --> 00:38:22.944
- I remained that way for a while.
- Really?

00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:26.030
I flopped on the floor and
stayed seated for a while.

00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:27.330
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Why?

00:38:27.354 --> 00:38:28.430
(She finds him cute.)

00:38:28.454 --> 00:38:30.684
That means he was really happy.

00:38:31.754 --> 00:38:34.130
- This is it. Thunder Falls.
- Thunder Falls.

00:38:34.154 --> 00:38:35.824
- It'll be fun.
- It'll be so much fun.

00:38:35.924 --> 00:38:37.484
Don't you get wet on that kind of ride?

00:38:37.624 --> 00:38:38.610
Probably.

00:38:38.634 --> 00:38:42.064
(They get on a ride
together for the first time.)

00:38:42.704 --> 00:38:43.934
Oh, dear me.

00:38:45.204 --> 00:38:47.004
(Sitting closely together)

00:38:47.134 --> 00:38:49.880
Their arms are touching. When that happens,

00:38:49.904 --> 00:38:52.614
it makes your heart flutter.

00:38:53.214 --> 00:38:55.760
Don't you feel that way, Woo
Young? Your arms would touch.

00:38:55.784 --> 00:38:57.384
Did you get a vaccine shot or something?

00:38:57.584 --> 00:38:59.054
Gosh, I can't speak to you.

00:38:59.514 --> 00:39:00.954
You just don't get it.

00:39:01.824 --> 00:39:03.884
(Sitting closely together)

00:39:04.154 --> 00:39:07.070
We'll get wet? Then I should... Oh, no.

00:39:07.094 --> 00:39:09.724
I'll put this fan in my bag.

00:39:10.024 --> 00:39:12.694
- I don't want it to get wet.
- I'll be sure to protect your bag.

00:39:12.964 --> 00:39:15.040
- I'll hold it like this.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

00:39:15.064 --> 00:39:16.234
(I'll protect your bag.)

00:39:16.664 --> 00:39:18.074
(Surprised)

00:39:18.604 --> 00:39:19.910
(Laughing)

00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:21.350
What was that reaction?
You can handle rides, right?

00:39:21.374 --> 00:39:23.820
- Yes. But I don't like to get wet.
- Right?

00:39:23.844 --> 00:39:24.844
- Oh, I see.
- Okay.

00:39:25.044 --> 00:39:26.114
I don't like to get wet.

00:39:29.084 --> 00:39:31.484
- Oh, gosh. Wait. Really?
- We're not falling just yet.

00:39:33.384 --> 00:39:34.530
(Protecting the quokka)

00:39:34.554 --> 00:39:36.854
(Getting closer to him)

00:39:37.254 --> 00:39:38.294
What's going on?

00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:42.064
(He finds her cute.)

00:39:42.324 --> 00:39:44.324
Why do I hate water so much?

00:39:44.794 --> 00:39:47.864
- But it's fun. It's really fun.
- It's fun, indeed.

00:39:48.764 --> 00:39:49.934
All right. Here we go.

00:39:50.164 --> 00:39:52.550
- We're falling backward?
- No way.

00:39:52.574 --> 00:39:54.280
- Right. That won't happen.
- It will turn around and fall.

00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:55.444
Let's go.

00:39:58.644 --> 00:39:59.674
Here we go!

00:40:01.844 --> 00:40:03.284
(She hides in the end.)

00:40:07.954 --> 00:40:09.314
My gosh. It creates a huge splash.

00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:12.954
- I wonder what Sang Hyeon will do.
- He's not blocking water for her.

00:40:13.054 --> 00:40:14.940
(So Hyun is soaking wet.)

00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:17.664
Look at my hair. My gosh.
I didn't know I'd get so wet.

00:40:17.994 --> 00:40:20.310
She's soaking wet. Look at her hair.

00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:22.140
I kept your bag dry as I promised.

00:40:22.164 --> 00:40:23.640
- Really?
- I kept it dry.

00:40:23.664 --> 00:40:26.050
You should've kept my hair dry, not my bag.

00:40:26.074 --> 00:40:27.074
(Sorry)

00:40:29.504 --> 00:40:30.904
Why didn't he cover her face?

00:40:31.074 --> 00:40:33.450
- He should've covered her face.
- Right. I wish he had done it.

00:40:33.474 --> 00:40:35.190
But he... I guess you didn't notice it.

00:40:35.214 --> 00:40:37.214
In my opinion, he covered her face.

00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:38.830
- By turning his head toward her?
- Yes.

00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:40.490
You're wrong. He did that

00:40:40.514 --> 00:40:42.930
- to keep his face dry.
- He was just protecting his face.

00:40:42.954 --> 00:40:44.130
That's why he leaned forward.

00:40:44.154 --> 00:40:46.830
Knowing Sang Hyeon,
he would've been too shy

00:40:46.854 --> 00:40:48.600
to cover her face with
his arms. So instead,

00:40:48.624 --> 00:40:50.264
he turned his head while leaning forward.

00:40:51.694 --> 00:40:52.934
He did that to block water.

00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:55.140
He actively expressed
his feelings by doing so.

00:40:55.164 --> 00:40:56.434
(SOOBIN finds it funny.)

00:40:56.534 --> 00:40:57.910
He was feeling very shy,

00:40:57.934 --> 00:40:59.634
but he tried to protect her.

00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:01.750
- Was that him protecting her?
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:41:01.774 --> 00:41:03.604
To be honest, I would...

00:41:03.974 --> 00:41:06.644
Maybe because I'm a little conservative,

00:41:06.814 --> 00:41:09.490
I'd cover her face like
this if she's my girlfriend.

00:41:09.514 --> 00:41:11.690
- You can just put a hand up.
- Like this.

00:41:11.714 --> 00:41:13.990
I mean, it's their first date,

00:41:14.014 --> 00:41:15.900
and they've known each
other for only two days.

00:41:15.924 --> 00:41:17.030
Covering her face with his
hands would also be a little...

00:41:17.054 --> 00:41:18.654
- But...
- What if you like her so much?

00:41:18.894 --> 00:41:21.294
What if you're really into her?

00:41:22.164 --> 00:41:23.870
You wouldn't cover her face
even if you're really into her?

00:41:23.894 --> 00:41:24.994
If I'm really into her?

00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:28.940
I thought Seul Hye's eyes would pop out.

00:41:28.964 --> 00:41:31.210
I was just curious... Aren't you curious?

00:41:31.234 --> 00:41:32.604
"SOOBIN, I really like it."

00:41:33.204 --> 00:41:34.534
"Cover my face, please."

00:41:35.504 --> 00:41:36.680
- "Can't you do it for me?"
- In that situation...

00:41:36.704 --> 00:41:38.074
(Cracking up)

00:41:41.584 --> 00:41:45.184
Let's eat first since we're
hungry. Let's just grab a bite...

00:41:46.454 --> 00:41:48.174
Goodness. Let me take this off for a while.

00:41:50.024 --> 00:41:51.654
My hair must've gotten flattened.

00:41:52.254 --> 00:41:55.564
But you don't look so bad.

00:41:56.264 --> 00:41:58.194
You look okay. Can
you come a little closer?

00:41:58.494 --> 00:41:59.471
(Leaning forward)

00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:00.534
Can you lower your head?

00:42:01.604 --> 00:42:02.704
That's good.

00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:05.250
- I applied hair product.
- No, it's not that. Look at this.

00:42:05.274 --> 00:42:06.514
You had this lint on your hair.

00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:08.674
That's nice.

00:42:09.804 --> 00:42:11.374
(Smiling)

00:42:12.214 --> 00:42:14.350
Do you mind if I ask you
this? Do you have any...

00:42:14.374 --> 00:42:16.620
Do you have any siblings?

00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:17.744
What do you think?

00:42:18.984 --> 00:42:20.030
(Thinking)

00:42:20.054 --> 00:42:21.824
- It's hard to guess.
- Is it?

00:42:21.954 --> 00:42:23.054
Honestly, I think...

00:42:24.624 --> 00:42:26.030
It feels like you'd have a younger sibling.

00:42:26.054 --> 00:42:27.870
- A younger sibling?
- Yes.

00:42:27.894 --> 00:42:29.500
- A sister or a brother?
- A brother.

00:42:29.524 --> 00:42:31.410
Oh, really? I wonder why.

00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:33.110
But many women with a younger brother

00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:35.604
don't think of a younger
man as more than a friend.

00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:38.110
They say that a younger man
feels like a younger brother.

00:42:38.134 --> 00:42:40.374
- Right. Indeed.
- I've heard that.

00:42:42.044 --> 00:42:43.274
(Curious)

00:42:43.474 --> 00:42:45.074
I have an older sister.

00:42:46.074 --> 00:42:47.990
(Smiling)

00:42:48.014 --> 00:42:49.084
Should I be relieved?

00:42:49.684 --> 00:42:50.790
"Should I be relieved?"

00:42:50.814 --> 00:42:52.884
I've seen some people who thought that way.

00:42:53.984 --> 00:42:55.754
Oh, my. Look at him. He seems happy.

00:42:57.124 --> 00:42:59.324
- You majored in computer science.
- Yes.

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.900
- I majored in computer science too.
- Really?

00:43:01.924 --> 00:43:03.194
- Really?
- Yes.

00:43:03.294 --> 00:43:04.524
- Is that true?
- Yes.

00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:08.504
The computer science lectures

00:43:08.704 --> 00:43:10.334
were really difficult for me.

00:43:11.064 --> 00:43:12.474
They were so difficult for me

00:43:13.134 --> 00:43:15.174
that I rarely went to school.

00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:16.821
(It's hard to believe.)

00:43:16.845 --> 00:43:17.880
I often went out to have fun.

00:43:17.904 --> 00:43:22.514
I believed I should have
fun during my college years.

00:43:22.784 --> 00:43:24.144
You're the opposite of me.

00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:25.384
Why? What's so different?

00:43:26.514 --> 00:43:28.714
I believed I should study
hard during my college years.

00:43:29.054 --> 00:43:30.354
I didn't drink.

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:31.624
Oh, right.

00:43:32.324 --> 00:43:33.524
I never had a drink.

00:43:34.224 --> 00:43:36.264
- Right.
- Of course, I also...

00:43:38.294 --> 00:43:40.670
You believed you were
supposed to study hard at college.

00:43:40.694 --> 00:43:43.710
Then when you were studying hard...

00:43:43.734 --> 00:43:44.950
(The 1st date is over. Please go
to the location in the 2nd photo.)

00:43:44.974 --> 00:43:47.110
- You must've had your own goal.
- The date is over already?

00:43:47.134 --> 00:43:48.674
You studied hard...

00:43:52.444 --> 00:43:53.744
(Snorting)

00:43:54.074 --> 00:43:56.184
(What's going on?)

00:43:56.784 --> 00:43:58.784
- Hold on a second.
- What's wrong?

00:43:59.784 --> 00:44:02.960
- We just rode a water ride, right?
- We rode a water ride.

00:44:02.984 --> 00:44:04.970
- It starts with "Thunder."
- We rode Thunder Falls.

00:44:04.994 --> 00:44:07.170
- Why?
- I want to ride T Express with you.

00:44:07.194 --> 00:44:08.264
Yes?

00:44:08.494 --> 00:44:09.924
Please don't say you can't.

00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:11.994
Please.

00:44:12.234 --> 00:44:14.634
- Please don't say you can't.
- Wait, no...

00:44:17.034 --> 00:44:19.874
(Sang Hyeon feels so
bad that he can't tell her.)

00:44:20.434 --> 00:44:22.004
What does it say?

00:44:24.404 --> 00:44:25.414
It says

00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:28.644
that the first Memory
Location Date is over.

00:44:30.414 --> 00:44:32.714
That the first Memory
Location Date is over.

00:44:35.054 --> 00:44:37.684
The first Memory Location Date is over?

00:44:41.964 --> 00:44:44.084
- What time is it now?
- Maybe we should've eaten it.

00:44:44.164 --> 00:44:46.094
- I mean, we should've ridden it.
- It's 4:30pm.

00:44:46.294 --> 00:44:47.494
We should've ridden T Express.

00:44:47.894 --> 00:44:49.640
It's over?

00:44:49.664 --> 00:44:51.080
Why didn't I get the message?

00:44:51.104 --> 00:44:52.550
(She checks her phone
as she's sad it's over.)

00:44:52.574 --> 00:44:53.934
Really? Then should you leave now?

00:44:54.704 --> 00:44:56.144
Is their date over?

00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:00.574
I think I should... Should I leave now?

00:45:00.814 --> 00:45:03.360
- I think I should leave now.
- Oh, no.

00:45:03.384 --> 00:45:04.614
We haven't ridden T Express.

00:45:05.384 --> 00:45:06.830
Let's come back here some other time.

00:45:06.854 --> 00:45:07.960
You really should see it.

00:45:07.984 --> 00:45:09.030
I wanted to go on a safari.

00:45:09.054 --> 00:45:11.430
And you wanted to ride T Express.

00:45:11.454 --> 00:45:12.724
You wanted to ride it.

00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:15.774
At least, it gave us a reason
to come back here together.

00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:18.534
We have a reason to come back.

00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:21.470
I'm sorry. For some reason...

00:45:21.494 --> 00:45:23.880
- Why?
- Sorry for leaving like this.

00:45:23.904 --> 00:45:25.704
- What are you sorry for?
- I mean...

00:45:26.504 --> 00:45:28.584
We couldn't do all the
things you wanted to do here.

00:45:31.204 --> 00:45:32.990
I couldn't understand what you
said. Why do you feel bad about it?

00:45:33.014 --> 00:45:34.020
Don't feel that way.

00:45:34.044 --> 00:45:35.584
I wanted to ride it too.

00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:39.354
- This is...
- You seem more disappointed.

00:45:40.714 --> 00:45:42.184
We had too little time.

00:45:43.284 --> 00:45:45.970
I would like to go

00:45:45.994 --> 00:45:48.564
on a date with Sang Hyeon again.

00:45:48.694 --> 00:45:50.224
I found him cute.

00:45:51.164 --> 00:45:53.310
It was nice. I had a
really great time with him.

00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.240
(I had a great time with him.)

00:45:55.264 --> 00:45:56.334
I'm embarrassed.

00:45:57.064 --> 00:45:58.374
Oh, my.

00:45:58.874 --> 00:46:00.574
Today, we just went

00:46:00.934 --> 00:46:02.180
to a fun place.

00:46:02.204 --> 00:46:04.120
I would've had fun there
no matter whom I was with.

00:46:04.144 --> 00:46:05.650
- No matter whom he was with?
- I would've been happy

00:46:05.674 --> 00:46:08.174
no matter whom I was with.

00:46:08.414 --> 00:46:11.784
The place made me feel like I was in love.

00:46:12.484 --> 00:46:14.360
So I was very sad

00:46:14.384 --> 00:46:17.284
because our date was over so early.

00:46:19.024 --> 00:46:20.330
I guess that's why couples often go

00:46:20.354 --> 00:46:22.140
- to an amusement park.
- That must be why.

00:46:22.164 --> 00:46:23.840
That place makes you feel that way, indeed.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:25.270
(Did the date with So Hyun
change Sang Hyeon's heart?)

00:46:25.294 --> 00:46:27.210
Their date

00:46:27.234 --> 00:46:29.640
made me jealous, and it
was nice to see them like that.

00:46:29.664 --> 00:46:32.680
I thought they could make a cute couple,

00:46:32.704 --> 00:46:34.980
for the first time while
watching their date.

00:46:35.004 --> 00:46:38.844
But the last thing that Sang Hyeon said

00:46:39.444 --> 00:46:40.744
bothers me.

00:46:40.974 --> 00:46:42.514
- "Whomever he was with?"
- Yes.

00:46:42.984 --> 00:46:45.760
He said that it was the place...

00:46:45.784 --> 00:46:47.360
- It was a special place?
- That made their date special.

00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:48.954
It sounded like that when he said that.

00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:51.630
He just talked about how
special the place made their date

00:46:51.654 --> 00:46:53.694
instead of talking about
his feelings about her.

00:46:53.794 --> 00:46:57.924
I guess that's all that he feels for now.

00:46:58.394 --> 00:47:02.240
But when Sang Hyeon was
on a date with the other women,

00:47:02.264 --> 00:47:03.310
he couldn't make eye contact with them.

00:47:03.334 --> 00:47:05.650
- He kept looking down at the floor.
- Right. He wasn't like that today.

00:47:05.674 --> 00:47:07.280
- He seemed very relaxed.
- He didn't act that way.

00:47:07.304 --> 00:47:08.504
He seemed most relaxed so far.

00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:10.450
- He seemed most relaxed so far.
- Oh, I didn't realize that.

00:47:10.474 --> 00:47:13.090
When their date was
over, he said he was sad

00:47:13.114 --> 00:47:14.850
they couldn't ride T
Express and everything.

00:47:14.874 --> 00:47:16.720
He seemed very disappointed

00:47:16.744 --> 00:47:19.260
that their date was over so
early, saying they couldn't ride it.

00:47:19.284 --> 00:47:22.284
And he said they had a reason
to go back there sometime.

00:47:22.484 --> 00:47:24.000
I think he said those things

00:47:24.024 --> 00:47:25.784
- because he was interested in her.
- I see.

00:47:25.954 --> 00:47:27.074
The thought crossed my mind.

00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:30.794
- Oh, right.
- There are 2 men, not just 1.

00:47:31.294 --> 00:47:36.934
(They're running to feel less sad?)

00:47:37.034 --> 00:47:38.080
(High five!)

00:47:38.104 --> 00:47:39.104
Oh, my.

00:47:39.704 --> 00:47:42.744
My goodness. I can't believe
this. He's shirtless again.

00:47:43.004 --> 00:47:44.974
The two of them look good together.

00:47:47.244 --> 00:47:50.514
That's good. Way to go.
They are enjoying themselves.

00:47:50.614 --> 00:47:51.814
My goodness.

00:47:52.014 --> 00:47:54.254
- I'm so glad they're doing that.
- I feel bad for them.

00:47:54.314 --> 00:47:57.584
- That's good. Hold it. Okay.
- You should make most of your time.

00:47:57.924 --> 00:47:58.930
Nice.

00:47:58.954 --> 00:48:00.230
(The physical pain will make
their emotional pain go away.)

00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:01.724
They're forcing themselves to smile.

00:48:01.824 --> 00:48:04.070
They made themselves
feel better by exercising.

00:48:04.094 --> 00:48:05.454
(Now shall we wait for the girls?)

00:48:05.764 --> 00:48:09.640
(A small art gallery in the
mountain in Gangwon Province)

00:48:09.664 --> 00:48:10.734
An art gallery?

00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.080
(And there is an older woman...)

00:48:15.104 --> 00:48:18.620
(who's waiting for a younger man...)

00:48:18.644 --> 00:48:22.444
(in the art gallery.)

00:48:23.884 --> 00:48:27.154
(A car is coming up
toward the art gallery.)

00:48:29.424 --> 00:48:34.600
(The younger man
arrives at the art gallery.)

00:48:34.624 --> 00:48:39.664
(It's Mu Jin.)

00:48:42.034 --> 00:48:45.550
She seemed different from
now. She looked younger.

00:48:45.574 --> 00:48:46.551
(She seemed different
and younger in her photo.)

00:48:46.575 --> 00:48:48.895
Since I heard it was a place
where she made good memories,

00:48:49.044 --> 00:48:50.580
I looked forward to our date.

00:48:50.604 --> 00:48:52.074
And I was curious about the place.

00:48:55.014 --> 00:49:00.154
(Chun Sung Myung)

00:49:03.854 --> 00:49:06.294
(Looking around)

00:49:16.904 --> 00:49:20.104
(He smiles as soon as he sees her.)

00:49:26.507 --> 00:49:29.317
(He smiles as soon as he sees her.)

00:49:29.917 --> 00:49:34.963
(The girl in the photo that
was in Mu Jin's drawer)

00:49:34.987 --> 00:49:38.403
(Bon Hee)

00:49:38.427 --> 00:49:39.903
They see each other every day at home.

00:49:39.927 --> 00:49:42.367
But seeing each other outside
must make their hearts flutter.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:46.360
- Hello.
- You're here.

00:49:46.597 --> 00:49:48.537
(He's simply happy.)

00:49:48.917 --> 00:49:50.019
- Did you wait long?
- Sorry?

00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:51.913
- Did you wait long?
- No, just a little bit.

00:49:52.437 --> 00:49:53.907
I didn't wait long.

00:49:54.507 --> 00:49:56.253
Shall we sit for a while
before looking around?

00:49:56.277 --> 00:49:57.277
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.393
I opened my drawer and found this photo.

00:50:03.836 --> 00:50:04.946
Was this photo taken here?

00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:08.517
- In this building. Yes.
- In this building?

00:50:10.387 --> 00:50:13.727
How did you feel when you saw this photo?

00:50:14.757 --> 00:50:16.127
I'm so embarrassed.

00:50:16.427 --> 00:50:18.667
- When I opened the drawer?
- Yes, how did you feel?

00:50:19.067 --> 00:50:21.043
- I was like, "Finally."
- "Finally?"

00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:22.097
It felt good.

00:50:24.937 --> 00:50:27.807
I thought, "I can finally go
on a date with Bon Hee."

00:50:29.277 --> 00:50:31.207
Mu Jin is aggressive as he always is.

00:50:32.307 --> 00:50:33.877
(Embarrassed)

00:50:34.517 --> 00:50:35.717
- Shall we go now?
- Okay.

00:50:36.947 --> 00:50:38.587
(Looking carefully)

00:50:39.087 --> 00:50:40.363
You brought your camera?

00:50:40.387 --> 00:50:42.157
I brought my film camera.

00:50:43.157 --> 00:50:46.357
Being back in this place makes me feel...

00:50:47.427 --> 00:50:49.067
- Does it bring back old memories?
- Yes.

00:50:51.297 --> 00:50:54.797
I came to Chuncheon on
a trip with my older sister.

00:50:55.697 --> 00:50:57.897
And we came to this
gallery. I really liked this place.

00:50:57.967 --> 00:50:59.767
It was before I opened my own studio.

00:50:59.967 --> 00:51:01.077
I see.

00:51:02.743 --> 00:51:04.713
How do you feel coming back here?

00:51:06.007 --> 00:51:08.493
It reminds me of the time

00:51:08.517 --> 00:51:11.847
when I was preparing to open my studio.

00:51:12.687 --> 00:51:14.287
I also remember how I felt then.

00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:19.787
I heard it was a meaningful
place for you, so I was curious.

00:51:24.127 --> 00:51:27.403
This is where the photo was taken.

00:51:27.427 --> 00:51:28.643
- Oh, it was taken here?
- Yes.

00:51:28.667 --> 00:51:31.137
(They found the spot where
her old photo was taken.)

00:51:32.267 --> 00:51:33.707
- Can I see the photo?
- Sure.

00:51:36.477 --> 00:51:38.707
- I think it was here.
- So this is it?

00:51:39.247 --> 00:51:41.047
Yes. Looking at this
spot, I remember it now.

00:51:41.677 --> 00:51:43.747
I feel that it was here.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.380
Shall I take a photo of
you at the same spot?

00:51:47.566 --> 00:51:48.982
Do you think you can use the camera?

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:50.163
- Yes, I'll do it.
- Really?

00:51:50.187 --> 00:51:52.433
Then I'll show you how to do it.

00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:54.133
- Show me.
- Okay.

00:51:54.157 --> 00:51:56.397
First, you should adjust
the horizontal axis.

00:51:57.057 --> 00:51:59.797
I'll set the aperture for you.

00:52:00.327 --> 00:52:02.573
You can just push this
button in the middle.

00:52:02.597 --> 00:52:04.567
- I just have to push it once?
- Yes.

00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:05.807
How about you try it?

00:52:06.007 --> 00:52:07.737
I set everything for you.

00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:10.083
How should I hold it to
make myself look good?

00:52:10.107 --> 00:52:12.177
Support the bottom of the camera like this.

00:52:12.847 --> 00:52:15.923
Hold the lens with your fingers like this.

00:52:15.947 --> 00:52:16.993
(A photographer's tip on how to hold
a camera to make yourself look good)

00:52:17.017 --> 00:52:18.177
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

00:52:19.247 --> 00:52:20.647
- Like this?
- That's right.

00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:26.203
- Their vibes match, right?
- Right.

00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:27.857
- Can you see?
- Yes, I can see.

00:52:28.197 --> 00:52:30.297
- Shall I stand there now?
- Yes, go ahead.

00:52:33.697 --> 00:52:35.497
Here? Shall I stand here?

00:52:36.637 --> 00:52:38.607
(He sees Bon Hee inside the frame.)

00:52:40.507 --> 00:52:42.037
You look like a good photographer.

00:52:42.277 --> 00:52:44.247
(Chuckling)

00:52:44.407 --> 00:52:46.377
You look perfect now.

00:52:47.077 --> 00:52:48.477
Perfect? Okay.

00:52:49.517 --> 00:52:50.677
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

00:52:51.747 --> 00:52:54.687
One, two, three.

00:52:55.617 --> 00:52:58.657
(She poses, holding her old photo.)

00:52:58.827 --> 00:53:01.527
- I hope it will come out great.
- I'm sure it will.

00:53:02.957 --> 00:53:04.603
My, Bon Hee looks so pretty.

00:53:04.627 --> 00:53:06.707
(Bon Hee in the old days,
on a trip with her family)

00:53:06.797 --> 00:53:09.143
- He did a great job.
- He took the photo well.

00:53:09.167 --> 00:53:10.887
(Bon Hee in the photo Mu Jin took just now)

00:53:11.307 --> 00:53:13.843
"I'm taking a photo of
you taking a photo of me."

00:53:13.867 --> 00:53:16.667
(She made a good memory with Mu
Jin at the place in her old memories.)

00:53:16.977 --> 00:53:19.147
- It's so nice.
- Indeed.

00:53:20.147 --> 00:53:23.847
I can see that autumn has
come. The sky is so clear.

00:53:26.687 --> 00:53:29.057
When they designed this building...

00:53:29.757 --> 00:53:32.627
They made it round,
which symbolizes the moon.

00:53:33.027 --> 00:53:34.527
- It symbolizes the moon?
- Yes.

00:53:34.727 --> 00:53:38.927
There's a light on the edge,
which is turned on at night.

00:53:39.697 --> 00:53:41.067
- It would look splendid.
- Yes.

00:53:41.897 --> 00:53:44.167
Shall we come back here at night...

00:53:44.867 --> 00:53:46.067
- Sounds great.
- Sometime?

00:53:47.877 --> 00:53:49.207
Was that a flirty comment?

00:53:49.307 --> 00:53:51.353
- Yes, it was explicit.
- "Shall we come at night?"

00:53:51.377 --> 00:53:52.417
This place is really nice.

00:53:52.607 --> 00:53:54.477
You smell really good today.

00:53:54.577 --> 00:53:58.287
I applied hair essence.
It may be the scent of it.

00:53:59.217 --> 00:54:02.333
- Anything you want to teach me?
- Like what?

00:54:02.357 --> 00:54:05.057
I taught you how to use a film camera.

00:54:05.687 --> 00:54:06.727
It could be your hobby.

00:54:06.927 --> 00:54:08.767
- My hobby?
- Trivial things would do as well.

00:54:11.597 --> 00:54:15.113
I want to hike or run
with my future girlfriend.

00:54:15.137 --> 00:54:16.937
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:54:18.037 --> 00:54:19.507
Where do you run?

00:54:19.607 --> 00:54:20.667
- Where do I run?
- Yes.

00:54:21.437 --> 00:54:24.177
I usually run in my
neighborhood or along the river.

00:54:25.377 --> 00:54:27.017
I guess I should go to your neighborhood.

00:54:28.117 --> 00:54:32.317
I could go to Seoul to run
with you along the Han River.

00:54:33.447 --> 00:54:34.517
What about hiking?

00:54:34.617 --> 00:54:36.633
Hiking would be really nice.

00:54:36.657 --> 00:54:38.457
It'd be really nice if we go hiking together.

00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:40.433
I thought of hiking too.

00:54:40.457 --> 00:54:43.127
Since I was 20,

00:54:45.167 --> 00:54:48.797
I've been dreaming of climbing
Mount Halla with my future husband.

00:54:49.737 --> 00:54:52.543
I used to tell my sisters
such things like that.

00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:53.637
I see.

00:54:54.007 --> 00:54:57.207
- I climbed Mount Halla once.
- I think I did so.

00:54:57.507 --> 00:54:58.607
It was so exhausting.

00:54:59.177 --> 00:55:02.293
I thought that unless my
future wife or my father-in-law...

00:55:02.317 --> 00:55:04.687
- Your father-in-law?
- I mean, my future father-in-law.

00:55:05.087 --> 00:55:07.757
Unless they ask me to climb Mount Halla...

00:55:08.517 --> 00:55:11.117
- You'd never go back there?
- Yes, I thought I'd never go there.

00:55:14.327 --> 00:55:17.897
But if you want, I'll climb
Mount Halla with you.

00:55:27.537 --> 00:55:28.677
A metal workshop?

00:55:29.407 --> 00:55:32.877
Last time we came
here, I wanted to try this.

00:55:33.507 --> 00:55:35.817
But this was closed back then.

00:55:36.877 --> 00:55:38.393
- So, we came to do it today.
- Yes.

00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:41.257
(Metal workshop)

00:55:42.317 --> 00:55:43.463
Is it a metal workshop?

00:55:43.487 --> 00:55:45.457
(A metal workshop located
under an art museum)

00:55:46.657 --> 00:55:49.703
You can make something
yourself and take it home.

00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:50.833
(A place where you can
make couple's items...)

00:55:50.857 --> 00:55:52.043
(like necklaces, bracelets, or rings)

00:55:52.067 --> 00:55:53.473
You can look at what you want to try,

00:55:53.497 --> 00:55:55.897
and tell me once you've decided.

00:55:56.837 --> 00:55:58.707
You can decide what you want to do.

00:55:59.067 --> 00:56:00.347
- Something I want to do?
- Yes.

00:56:01.307 --> 00:56:03.627
- Couple's rings, of course.
- They're even getting rings?

00:56:04.547 --> 00:56:09.177
(Contemplating)

00:56:09.547 --> 00:56:11.393
Bracelets, rings...

00:56:11.417 --> 00:56:12.617
Go for the rings!

00:56:13.187 --> 00:56:15.533
- Don't do a necklace.
- Wouldn't a bracelet be better?

00:56:15.557 --> 00:56:18.077
(Thinking for a long time
since it's their first couple's item)

00:56:19.027 --> 00:56:20.027
Rings?

00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:21.697
Okay.

00:56:22.127 --> 00:56:23.157
Oh, rings.

00:56:23.527 --> 00:56:24.867
Isn't that too obvious?

00:56:25.567 --> 00:56:26.544
Good!

00:56:26.568 --> 00:56:28.167
- Why would you get rings?
- Good!

00:56:28.637 --> 00:56:29.697
Indeed.

00:56:30.937 --> 00:56:32.483
(Rings?)

00:56:32.507 --> 00:56:33.707
(Okay!)

00:56:34.777 --> 00:56:37.037
Sir, we'll go with rings.

00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:38.777
- Rings?
- Yes.

00:56:39.107 --> 00:56:42.323
A ring has a different meaning,

00:56:42.347 --> 00:56:43.717
compared to other accessories.

00:56:44.487 --> 00:56:47.017
Sharing something for the first time

00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:51.227
is memorable, and I'm very aware of that.

00:56:51.857 --> 00:56:54.027
I think it's meaningful for me too.

00:56:55.497 --> 00:56:59.067
I actually thought he
obviously wouldn't choose rings,

00:56:59.367 --> 00:57:02.637
so I gave him other choices on purpose.

00:57:03.297 --> 00:57:05.937
But he chose rings, which I
was kind of surprised about.

00:57:06.967 --> 00:57:08.737
I think it felt weird.

00:57:09.277 --> 00:57:11.357
Of course it feels weird if
you make rings together.

00:57:13.277 --> 00:57:15.377
- Try it on.
- Wait, okay, let's try them on.

00:57:16.617 --> 00:57:18.177
Which finger do you want to wear it on?

00:57:19.717 --> 00:57:22.433
I think I'll see my index
finger when I take photos.

00:57:22.457 --> 00:57:24.903
So, I want to wear it on this
one. I press the shutter with it.

00:57:24.927 --> 00:57:26.663
Oh, as she presses the
shutter, - Can you help me?

00:57:26.687 --> 00:57:28.327
- It'll be shiny, right?
- Like that?

00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:32.367
We got texts. I'll read it first.

00:57:33.197 --> 00:57:35.373
(It's a day to grow closer to one another.)

00:57:35.397 --> 00:57:39.807
(Please speak casually, including
the way you address each other.)

00:57:40.307 --> 00:57:42.753
It says we have to
address each other casually.

00:57:42.777 --> 00:57:43.953
"Please speak casually,"
- Yes.

00:57:43.977 --> 00:57:45.283
"Including the way you address each other."

00:57:45.307 --> 00:57:46.723
- I think Mu Jin will do fine.
- Right.

00:57:46.747 --> 00:57:47.724
- I know, right?
- Yes.

00:57:47.748 --> 00:57:50.493
I usually don't speak casually.

00:57:50.517 --> 00:57:52.017
I speak with honorifics

00:57:52.947 --> 00:57:54.817
even to my employees.

00:57:56.687 --> 00:57:57.957
Speak comfortably.

00:57:59.087 --> 00:58:00.357
What should we do?

00:58:00.787 --> 00:58:01.997
I will try.

00:58:02.297 --> 00:58:04.057
- Can you do it?
- I'll try.

00:58:05.467 --> 00:58:07.243
I may not speak that much, but...

00:58:07.267 --> 00:58:08.343
(Giggling)

00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:10.597
I may speak less, but
you have to understand.

00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:12.637
I'll try. I can do it.

00:58:13.567 --> 00:58:15.283
How we address each
other? We have to decide.

00:58:15.307 --> 00:58:16.377
How we address each other?

00:58:16.777 --> 00:58:18.677
I just

00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:21.077
prefer calling each other by name.

00:58:21.347 --> 00:58:24.817
I think I'd be most comfortable
with calling you Mu Jin.

00:58:24.987 --> 00:58:26.123
How should I address you?

00:58:26.147 --> 00:58:27.623
Sang Hyeon called So Hyun, "You."

00:58:27.647 --> 00:58:28.757
Should we do the same?

00:58:29.117 --> 00:58:30.187
- Just Bon Hee?
- Yes.

00:58:30.487 --> 00:58:32.687
(Embarrassed after saying it himself)

00:58:34.127 --> 00:58:35.727
Do you not like being called "Noona?"

00:58:37.927 --> 00:58:39.503
I like being called by name the most.

00:58:39.527 --> 00:58:40.597
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:58:41.167 --> 00:58:42.573
We don't like being called "Noona."

00:58:42.597 --> 00:58:44.907
- I like being called "Noona."
- I don't like it.

00:58:45.367 --> 00:58:47.043
From the man's perspective,

00:58:47.067 --> 00:58:50.553
do you usually call a woman
"Noona" if you're interested in her?

00:58:50.577 --> 00:58:51.747
What do you guys think?

00:58:51.907 --> 00:58:53.453
Wouldn't I naturally call her "Noona?"

00:58:53.477 --> 00:58:54.593
Even if you like her?

00:58:54.617 --> 00:58:55.693
- Doesn't it matter?
- No.

00:58:55.717 --> 00:58:56.793
Regardless of your feelings for her,

00:58:56.817 --> 00:58:58.123
- you just call her, "Noona?"
- Yes.

00:58:58.147 --> 00:58:59.993
Even if you go on a date with her,

00:59:00.017 --> 00:59:01.223
- you still call her "Noona?"
- Yes.

00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:03.563
I would call her "Noona" even
when I date her and marry her.

00:59:03.587 --> 00:59:05.327
- Right.
- Until you die?

00:59:05.557 --> 00:59:08.173
Even when you're 80
years old, you'll go, "Noona?"

00:59:08.197 --> 00:59:09.174
I think I would.

00:59:09.198 --> 00:59:10.397
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:11.743
What about you, Woo Young?

00:59:11.767 --> 00:59:14.813
I think I would use whatever
my partner is comfortable with.

00:59:14.837 --> 00:59:17.173
If she says, "I don't like Noona.
Call me something else," then...

00:59:17.197 --> 00:59:19.537
Then, I'd cater to you. Yes.

00:59:20.467 --> 00:59:22.453
- I would cater to you.
- What do you mean, cater to me?

00:59:22.477 --> 00:59:23.837
What do you feel comfortable with?

00:59:24.407 --> 00:59:25.577
I would cater to you.

00:59:26.277 --> 00:59:29.217
What? Ms. Han? Or
like... I would cater to you.

00:59:30.577 --> 00:59:32.787
- Then, I'll call you Bon Hee.
- Okay.

00:59:34.587 --> 00:59:37.817
(Feeling shy for some reason)

00:59:39.687 --> 00:59:40.787
- From here?
- From here...

00:59:40.987 --> 00:59:42.597
Have you ever made a ring before?

00:59:43.297 --> 00:59:44.427
A ring?

00:59:44.527 --> 00:59:46.443
A ring? A long time ago.

00:59:46.467 --> 00:59:47.697
- A long time ago?
- Yes.

00:59:49.537 --> 00:59:52.667
I've never had couple's rings before.

00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:54.343
- Really?
- I've never had one before.

00:59:54.367 --> 00:59:55.813
(Really?)

00:59:55.837 --> 00:59:57.957
I've never worn couple's
T-shirts or anything either.

00:59:58.807 --> 01:00:00.047
Really?

01:00:02.447 --> 01:00:03.947
So, this is your first couple's ring?

01:00:06.087 --> 01:00:08.217
Why didn't you have one until now?

01:00:09.717 --> 01:00:12.087
(Curious)

01:00:14.327 --> 01:00:15.973
I wanted to get one when I got married.

01:00:15.997 --> 01:00:18.297
(I wanted to get one when I got married.)

01:00:19.527 --> 01:00:22.667
(Laughing)

01:00:23.137 --> 01:00:25.243
So, couple's rings had meaning for you.

01:00:25.267 --> 01:00:26.267
Yes.

01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:31.407
I don't think I've dated anyone
I wanted to share one with.

01:00:34.277 --> 01:00:36.147
Then, these are very meaningful rings.

01:00:36.317 --> 01:00:39.517
Then, does this mean she is
considering marriage with Mu Jin?

01:00:41.187 --> 01:00:42.917
Should we make one for each other?

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:44.987
(Nodding)

01:00:49.027 --> 01:00:50.787
- That's good, right?
- You're good at this.

01:00:51.157 --> 01:00:52.267
This is fun.

01:00:52.367 --> 01:00:54.927
- It's more fun than I thought.
- A lot more fun than I thought.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:56.673
(Slipping)

01:00:56.697 --> 01:00:57.767
What?

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:00.467
Gosh, I almost made a huge mistake.

01:01:02.337 --> 01:01:05.007
I think it's fun to make mistakes, though.

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:07.877
Because...

01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:09.423
Because?

01:01:09.447 --> 01:01:11.967
I think I'll remember you making
a mistake every time I see it.

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:14.547
Rather than being so good at this.

01:01:16.817 --> 01:01:19.103
Bon Hee herself is

01:01:19.127 --> 01:01:21.403
- giving the ring a lot of meaning.
- Right.

01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:24.067
(Making couple's rings with Bon
Hee and Mu Jin's memories in them)

01:01:24.897 --> 01:01:26.797
So, that's how they're made.

01:01:27.897 --> 01:01:31.397
You chose sizes 15 and 18, right?

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.267
I have skinny fingers.

01:01:34.137 --> 01:01:36.077
You have pretty hands.

01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:37.977
- Are they?
- Yes.

01:01:39.207 --> 01:01:40.777
Noona, your hands are pretty too.

01:01:42.217 --> 01:01:44.117
- Sorry?
- Your hands are pretty too.

01:01:46.147 --> 01:01:47.517
(Shy)

01:01:50.987 --> 01:01:55.297
Mu Jin called me
"Noona" for the first time.

01:01:55.497 --> 01:01:57.057
At the time, I...

01:01:58.797 --> 01:02:00.643
It kind of felt real for the first time.

01:02:00.667 --> 01:02:01.644
Really?

01:02:01.668 --> 01:02:05.307
Until now, I was kind of immersed
in the emotions from before.

01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:10.253
I was just happy and having fun.

01:02:10.277 --> 01:02:12.247
But earlier, - She
must've been taken aback.

01:02:12.377 --> 01:02:14.453
I had so many thoughts
in my head about Mu Jin.

01:02:14.477 --> 01:02:15.493
This is huge.

01:02:15.517 --> 01:02:19.087
Because I have a younger brother
who's much younger than me.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:23.487
In that case... I am attracted to Mu Jin,

01:02:24.257 --> 01:02:26.863
but will we really be okay
once we learn about our ages?

01:02:26.887 --> 01:02:29.927
I still have that thought.

01:02:30.797 --> 01:02:32.403
We can just think about dating,

01:02:32.427 --> 01:02:35.273
but I'm usually the type who
considers marriage as I date.

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:37.073
- She's very careful and serious.
- So,

01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:40.283
later on, when our
ages are finally revealed,

01:02:40.307 --> 01:02:42.277
will we be okay? I'm
curious about that myself.

01:02:44.737 --> 01:02:48.817
(Bon Hee has a rush of emotions
upon hearing the word "Noona.")

01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:50.847
- Let's try them on.
- Okay.

01:02:54.747 --> 01:02:55.933
(Slipping it on)

01:02:55.957 --> 01:02:57.157
- It's just...
- Perfect.

01:02:57.387 --> 01:02:58.557
It fits perfectly for me too.

01:03:01.387 --> 01:03:04.257
They're really pretty. I like them.

01:03:04.597 --> 01:03:06.767
- Do you like them?
- Yes, they're so pretty.

01:03:06.927 --> 01:03:09.197
- We should take a photo.
- Okay.

01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:12.237
Crossed? Like this?

01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:16.013
We both have pretty hands.

01:03:16.037 --> 01:03:17.283
Yes, they're pretty.

01:03:17.307 --> 01:03:19.207
- Like this?
- In 1, 2, 3.

01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:22.947
- They look good on us.
- Yes.

01:03:23.517 --> 01:03:24.617
They're so pretty.

01:03:25.147 --> 01:03:28.263
By the way, if they wear those back
to Yeon House, there will be chaos.

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:30.117
Sang Hyeon might feel heartbroken.

01:03:30.387 --> 01:03:33.727
Is being called "Noona"
such a shocking incident?

01:03:36.057 --> 01:03:37.627
I know. I feel the same way.

01:03:37.757 --> 01:03:38.873
- Right?
- Yes.

01:03:38.897 --> 01:03:42.167
Gosh, this is... It's simply...

01:03:42.797 --> 01:03:46.437
It's not like a pet name.
You're just addressing someone.

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:49.107
It's a way to address someone,
but suddenly, from that...

01:03:49.707 --> 01:03:52.547
Like, all of a sudden, she
seems to have woken up.

01:03:52.847 --> 01:03:54.947
"How many years are we apart?"

01:03:55.117 --> 01:03:56.923
"When I hear this man's age,"

01:03:56.947 --> 01:03:59.293
"will I still be able to
feel attracted to him?"

01:03:59.317 --> 01:04:01.017
I think I've felt that way before too.

01:04:01.317 --> 01:04:02.793
Not in a relationship,

01:04:02.817 --> 01:04:05.157
but when someone is
expressing his interest in me.

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:08.497
I also want to date with marriage in mind,

01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:10.203
but I wondered, "Can I
just date casually like this?"

01:04:10.227 --> 01:04:13.397
It made me sensitive about
even the smallest things.

01:04:16.067 --> 01:04:18.437
(Mount Nam)

01:04:19.267 --> 01:04:22.377
(Holding a ticket for the
cable cars in her hand, )

01:04:22.877 --> 01:04:26.207
(the older woman waits for her date
on Mount Nam, a memory location.)

01:04:27.107 --> 01:04:31.153
(And a younger man comes to Mount Nam.)

01:04:31.177 --> 01:04:32.487
Finally, Sang Won...

01:04:34.117 --> 01:04:35.987
- Ji Won?
- What?

01:04:36.487 --> 01:04:42.603
(The 1st of 2 photos in Sang Won's drawer)

01:04:42.627 --> 01:04:44.827
(Ji Won)

01:04:45.467 --> 01:04:48.227
(Ji Won greets Sang
Won with a bright smile.)

01:04:49.867 --> 01:04:51.913
- This is from you, right?
- It is.

01:04:51.937 --> 01:04:53.737
How old is this photo?

01:04:54.267 --> 01:04:56.237
- How long ago was this taken?
- Yes.

01:04:56.637 --> 01:04:59.853
This was in my early 20s.

01:04:59.877 --> 01:05:01.107
- Early 20s?
- Yes.

01:05:01.747 --> 01:05:05.347
(The photo in Sang Won's
drawer is of Ji Won in her 20s.)

01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:08.487
I mean, it's obviously you,

01:05:09.387 --> 01:05:10.627
but the quality of the photo...

01:05:12.157 --> 01:05:14.463
Well, the quality...

01:05:14.487 --> 01:05:15.757
- Is that so?
- A bit.

01:05:16.457 --> 01:05:17.533
By the way, wasn't it hot?

01:05:17.557 --> 01:05:18.743
- It's hot right now.
- It is, right?

01:05:18.767 --> 01:05:19.903
You should have some of this.

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:22.467
- Can I have this?
- Yes, you can.

01:05:22.737 --> 01:05:23.714
(Sang Won brought
beverages to share with Ji Won.)

01:05:23.738 --> 01:05:25.643
Did you bring these tumblers?

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:27.937
- Yes, I brought some drinks.
- They're cute.

01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:30.577
- Can we drink them now?
- Oh, that's how it works.

01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:31.953
(Satisfied)

01:05:31.977 --> 01:05:32.977
It's nice and cool.

01:05:34.647 --> 01:05:37.453
I had said I was curious about Sang Won,

01:05:37.477 --> 01:05:39.287
and Yang Ji Yung.

01:05:39.447 --> 01:05:43.957
Last night, I spoke with Ji Yung for a bit.

01:05:45.427 --> 01:05:51.273
(Ji Yung had been honest about
wanting to focus on So Hyun.)

01:05:51.297 --> 01:05:55.537
From his answer, I just
made up my mind right away.

01:05:56.197 --> 01:06:00.137
I only want to talk more with Sang Won now,

01:06:00.407 --> 01:06:02.637
and I want to get to know him more.

01:06:03.307 --> 01:06:05.747
I just hope Sang Won doesn't ruin it.

01:06:06.607 --> 01:06:08.847
(Concerned about Sang Won)

01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:12.063
Then, are we going up on the cable car now?

01:06:12.087 --> 01:06:14.963
- Yes, I got us a ticket.
- Oh, thank you.

01:06:14.987 --> 01:06:16.693
So, we can take that up.

01:06:16.717 --> 01:06:17.817
For two?

01:06:17.887 --> 01:06:19.027
Where are we going?

01:06:23.857 --> 01:06:24.857
Thank you.

01:06:26.727 --> 01:06:29.567
"Please speak casually, including
the way you address each other."

01:06:30.037 --> 01:06:32.213
- How we address each other?
- How we address each other?

01:06:32.237 --> 01:06:33.213
What should I call you?

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:34.237
(Staring into her eyes)

01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:36.537
What should I call you?
How we address each other?

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.383
Our names both end in Won.

01:06:38.407 --> 01:06:40.123
- I know, I thought about that too.
- Won and Won...

01:06:40.147 --> 01:06:41.583
- Oh, Sang Won and Ji Won?
- Shall we just

01:06:41.607 --> 01:06:44.453
- call each other Won?
- Oh, for each other?

01:06:44.477 --> 01:06:46.293
- Won. What do you think?
- Nice.

01:06:46.317 --> 01:06:48.093
I like it. Then, starting right now?

01:06:48.117 --> 01:06:49.217
- What?
- Casual mode.

01:06:50.117 --> 01:06:51.463
- Let's try.
- Let's do it.

01:06:51.487 --> 01:06:53.087
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:06:53.187 --> 01:06:54.263
Won, shall we go?

01:06:54.287 --> 01:06:55.327
Let's go.

01:06:55.627 --> 01:06:58.303
- Shall we go to ride the cable car?
- Let's go.

01:06:58.327 --> 01:07:00.343
- All right.
- Ji Won leads a man so well.

01:07:00.367 --> 01:07:01.473
(Won and Won start their Mount Nam date.)

01:07:01.497 --> 01:07:04.267
My, we're riding the
cable car. I'm excited.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:05.837
It's nice.

01:07:06.337 --> 01:07:07.314
(The cable car goes up
to the top of Mount Nam.)

01:07:07.338 --> 01:07:09.377
It's really nice. This is fascinating.

01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:13.177
How beautiful.

01:07:13.277 --> 01:07:15.077
I've never ridden it
before in my whole life.

01:07:15.117 --> 01:07:16.223
- Really?
- Yes.

01:07:16.247 --> 01:07:18.377
I don't think I've ever
ridden a cable car here.

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:20.323
I think this is my first time coming here.

01:07:20.347 --> 01:07:22.117
This is the date I wanted to go on.

01:07:30.257 --> 01:07:33.167
(Impressed)

01:07:34.197 --> 01:07:35.313
- It's beautiful.
- I mean,

01:07:35.337 --> 01:07:37.043
- thank you for taking me here.
- Do you mean that?

01:07:37.067 --> 01:07:38.787
- I'm at Mount Nam thanks to you.
- Really?

01:07:39.037 --> 01:07:40.137
I mean it.

01:07:40.237 --> 01:07:42.153
I've never had a chance
to enjoy a scenery like this.

01:07:42.177 --> 01:07:44.177
I planned this date.

01:07:44.337 --> 01:07:45.823
This is so nice. I'm really excited.

01:07:45.847 --> 01:07:47.147
- Really?
- Really.

01:07:47.707 --> 01:07:49.947
- My, the view here is beautiful.
- Indeed.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:53.363
- I don't think I've seen it before.
- Exactly.

01:07:53.387 --> 01:07:55.093
I didn't know I could
enjoy such a scenery here.

01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:56.163
This is really nice.

01:07:56.187 --> 01:07:57.333
(You can see Seoul at a
glance on top of Mount Nam.)

01:07:57.357 --> 01:07:59.457
Thank you so much for coming here with me.

01:07:59.487 --> 01:08:01.873
Don't say that. I should be thanking you.

01:08:01.897 --> 01:08:05.003
While I was alone, waiting
for you, I started to worry

01:08:05.027 --> 01:08:06.743
no one might come.

01:08:06.767 --> 01:08:07.943
Is that possible?

01:08:07.967 --> 01:08:10.073
- I thought it could be the case.
- I see.

01:08:10.097 --> 01:08:11.457
- You just thought vaguely?
- Yes.

01:08:11.597 --> 01:08:12.983
- I see.
- So I thought

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:15.453
- that I would take a selfie...
- Take a selfie alone?

01:08:15.477 --> 01:08:17.483
In front of the wall of locks
just as I did in my old photo.

01:08:17.507 --> 01:08:20.153
I was going to take a
selfie there and go back.

01:08:20.177 --> 01:08:22.147
But then suddenly, you appeared behind me.

01:08:22.747 --> 01:08:24.993
I heard you calling me.

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:26.193
(She was happy to hear his voice.)

01:08:26.217 --> 01:08:27.517
I got excited that you came.

01:08:28.317 --> 01:08:30.617
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

01:08:31.557 --> 01:08:34.157
- Do you remember this day clearly?
- Yes.

01:08:34.287 --> 01:08:36.303
Yes. This is when I

01:08:36.327 --> 01:08:38.743
- I transferred to another college.
- I see.

01:08:38.767 --> 01:08:41.803
This is when I was studying
for the transfer exam.

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:45.167
I wanted to get some fresh air
since all I did was study back then.

01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:49.213
So I decided to come to Seoul
Tower with a female friend.

01:08:49.237 --> 01:08:51.513
- With a female friend?
- Yes. I told myself

01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:55.123
to become splendid just like Seoul Tower.

01:08:55.147 --> 01:08:56.187
It made me think that way.

01:08:56.347 --> 01:08:58.763
And right now, I'm studying
to become a co-pilot.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:09:00.863
- You're preparing to be one.
- I'm preparing

01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:02.263
to become a co-pilot as I hope.

01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:04.663
So I kind of have the same feelings
I had when this photo was taken.

01:09:04.687 --> 01:09:06.103
- You feel that way again.
- Yes.

01:09:06.127 --> 01:09:10.173
I want to see the splendid scenery...

01:09:10.197 --> 01:09:12.203
- To boost your morale?
- Yes, to boost my morale.

01:09:12.227 --> 01:09:14.273
When you look back later in your life,

01:09:14.297 --> 01:09:15.873
you'll realize how important

01:09:15.897 --> 01:09:17.573
the process of the preparation
and planning for the future is.

01:09:17.597 --> 01:09:19.267
We just don't realize it yet.

01:09:20.267 --> 01:09:22.907
Don't think you're not splendid now.

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:24.837
You're shining brightly now.

01:09:26.507 --> 01:09:27.707
You're shining brightly now.

01:09:29.647 --> 01:09:31.293
- My, Sang Won impressed me.
- How sweet.

01:09:31.317 --> 01:09:32.294
(Impressed)

01:09:32.318 --> 01:09:33.638
That's such a thoughtful comment.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:34.963
He didn't ruin it.

01:09:34.987 --> 01:09:36.987
- Doesn't he seem so attractive?
- Of course.

01:09:37.717 --> 01:09:39.203
We've never seen him like this before.

01:09:39.227 --> 01:09:40.557
Right. It's a new side of him.

01:09:40.887 --> 01:09:42.927
I hope things will go well
between the two of them.

01:09:44.127 --> 01:09:48.873
(You're shining brightly now.)

01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.173
(Touched)

01:09:50.197 --> 01:09:51.513
Think that when you look in the mirror.

01:09:51.537 --> 01:09:53.637
- The sun makes me shine right now.
- Right.

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:55.737
Maybe it's your sweat
that's sparkling in the sun.

01:09:56.337 --> 01:09:58.477
- Can we go there to see it?
- Let's do that.

01:10:00.207 --> 01:10:01.607
This is really nice.

01:10:02.117 --> 01:10:03.277
It's magnificent.

01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:05.947
I'm so grateful toward
you. I really mean it.

01:10:06.117 --> 01:10:07.417
- Really?
- It feels like

01:10:07.547 --> 01:10:09.393
I've been living in Seoul
since I was a little boy.

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:13.227
But I rarely visit famous places
like the Han River or Seoul Tower.

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:15.673
- You don't visit such places?
- I rarely visit those places.

01:10:15.697 --> 01:10:17.227
Have you ever visited Seosulla-gil?

01:10:17.597 --> 01:10:19.073
- Yes, just once.
- Really?

01:10:19.097 --> 01:10:21.097
- Really?
- Was it next to Jongmyo?

01:10:21.297 --> 01:10:22.817
- I think it was.
- Yes. That's right.

01:10:23.497 --> 01:10:24.697
Have you visited there before?

01:10:24.897 --> 01:10:26.483
- I'm going to.
- You haven't?

01:10:26.507 --> 01:10:27.767
- With you.
- "With you."

01:10:28.507 --> 01:10:29.613
- Today?
- No.

01:10:29.637 --> 01:10:32.353
I was surprised. I thought
we were going to Seosulla-gil

01:10:32.377 --> 01:10:33.707
after this.

01:10:33.907 --> 01:10:36.293
No, that's not the case. Let's
take some photos over there.

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:37.577
I want to save this memory.

01:10:37.847 --> 01:10:39.247
- What do you say?
- Let's do that.

01:10:39.687 --> 01:10:41.163
I'm really good at taking photos.

01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:42.263
- You are?
- Yes.

01:10:42.287 --> 01:10:43.557
(Staying close together)

01:10:44.057 --> 01:10:45.063
(He's so sweet. He blocks the sun for her.)

01:10:45.087 --> 01:10:47.263
Look at this couple. They're so sweet.

01:10:47.287 --> 01:10:48.403
This is unexpected.

01:10:48.427 --> 01:10:49.587
You should take it like this.

01:10:49.897 --> 01:10:51.527
Things are going so smoothly.

01:10:51.757 --> 01:10:53.297
They seem so close to each other.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:54.797
I can't see it.

01:10:54.967 --> 01:10:56.143
I hope things will go well between them.

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:57.673
(They take a selfie before the
locks like in Ji Won's old photo.)

01:10:57.697 --> 01:10:58.857
I'm rooting for the director.

01:11:03.377 --> 01:11:06.307
(She came to Mount Nam alone
when she was having a hard time.)

01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:07.983
In the future, I can compare this

01:11:08.007 --> 01:11:10.123
- to my old photo...
- You can compare the photos.

01:11:10.147 --> 01:11:12.287
- Sang Won caters to her too.
- Right.

01:11:12.317 --> 01:11:14.293
I hope I can come back here very soon.

01:11:14.317 --> 01:11:16.617
Really? Will you let me come with you?

01:11:16.657 --> 01:11:18.293
- Yes. We should come together.
- Really?

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:20.117
I can't come here alone
because it's too far.

01:11:21.057 --> 01:11:22.173
Let's go up there.

01:11:22.197 --> 01:11:23.773
- Can we go up there?
- Yes.

01:11:23.797 --> 01:11:25.467
What are we going to do next?

01:11:25.897 --> 01:11:27.173
Do you like pork cutlet?

01:11:27.197 --> 01:11:29.167
- I love it. Most men like it.
- Oh, I see.

01:11:32.907 --> 01:11:34.137
The view is amazing.

01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:36.413
I've never heard about this place.

01:11:36.437 --> 01:11:37.414
(The restaurant on top of Mount
Nam with a wide-open view)

01:11:37.438 --> 01:11:38.537
- It's beautiful.
- Right.

01:11:45.487 --> 01:11:47.093
(Hesitating)

01:11:47.117 --> 01:11:49.077
I'm not sure if it's okay
for me to ask you this.

01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:52.433
Was each of you allowed
to put in only one photo?

01:11:52.457 --> 01:11:54.127
- Or several photos?
- Only one photo.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.457
- Really?
- Yes.

01:11:56.397 --> 01:11:57.403
- I put this in your drawer.
- I see.

01:11:57.427 --> 01:11:59.927
- You put it in my drawer?
- Yes, I put it in there myself.

01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:03.273
We were told you put our
old photos in the drawer

01:12:03.297 --> 01:12:05.983
of the man we wanted to go on a date with.

01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:08.013
(Sang Won found out that Ji Won chose him.)

01:12:08.037 --> 01:12:10.277
- Oh, that's how it was decided.
- Yes, that's how...

01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:12.777
Did you have one photo in your drawer?

01:12:14.377 --> 01:12:15.777
There were two photos in my drawer.

01:12:16.817 --> 01:12:17.823
There were two photos in my drawer.

01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:18.993
(Realizing)

01:12:19.017 --> 01:12:20.863
- Ji Won is smart.
- I decided to come to Mount Nam.

01:12:20.887 --> 01:12:22.767
She asked if there was
one photo in his drawer.

01:12:23.057 --> 01:12:25.633
I wasn't surprised that he
received more than one photo

01:12:25.657 --> 01:12:26.957
since he was a popular type.

01:12:28.127 --> 01:12:30.597
I tried to think of some things I could do

01:12:31.157 --> 01:12:32.567
to make him find me attractive.

01:12:33.467 --> 01:12:36.197
I think it was Ye Eun.

01:12:36.867 --> 01:12:38.337
I didn't ask him who it was,

01:12:39.537 --> 01:12:40.767
but I knew it was her.

01:12:42.737 --> 01:12:43.753
Here's your food.

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.083
- Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

01:12:45.107 --> 01:12:46.453
- Is this diet soda?
- Yes, that's diet soda.

01:12:46.477 --> 01:12:48.647
- Thanks. Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:12:48.977 --> 01:12:51.117
- Let's clink our cups.
- Let's do that.

01:12:51.677 --> 01:12:52.717
Cheers.

01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:56.333
- Do you prefer regular cola?
- Yes.

01:12:56.357 --> 01:12:57.393
Really?

01:12:57.417 --> 01:12:59.063
Isn't this your first time drinking
regular soda since the show began?

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.087
That's right.

01:13:00.787 --> 01:13:02.087
- Soda with sugar.
- Right.

01:13:02.697 --> 01:13:03.797
You should've said so.

01:13:04.657 --> 01:13:06.567
If you go grocery shopping next time,

01:13:07.027 --> 01:13:09.797
- You want regular Coke?
- Pick up some regular Coke for me.

01:13:09.937 --> 01:13:12.567
I heard you had a really good memory.

01:13:12.637 --> 01:13:13.707
- Yes, I do.
- Right.

01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:17.183
That you remember other people's
preferences and things like that.

01:13:17.207 --> 01:13:18.507
I heard that.

01:13:19.377 --> 01:13:23.693
(The day when Sang Won
bought wasabi that Ye Eun liked)

01:13:23.717 --> 01:13:25.423
I think I ate all the wasabi here.

01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:27.347
- She's a wasabi lover.
- I'm glad I bought it.

01:13:28.047 --> 01:13:31.487
(Ji Won remembered
Sang Won's thoughtfulness.)

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:33.957
- I like to take care of others.
- I see.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.557
And to take care of
someone I like, in my opinion,

01:13:37.057 --> 01:13:41.197
I should memorize what she likes,

01:13:41.327 --> 01:13:43.397
and what she needs.

01:13:44.037 --> 01:13:45.837
So I put in some effort.

01:13:47.367 --> 01:13:48.767
I now know you prefer regular Coke.

01:13:49.277 --> 01:13:51.577
Once I memorize something, I never forget.

01:13:51.837 --> 01:13:52.847
Really?

01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:54.783
(Smiling happily)

01:13:54.807 --> 01:13:57.093
"I heard you had a really good memory."

01:13:57.117 --> 01:13:58.447
Ji Won said that.

01:13:58.577 --> 01:14:00.523
I wonder why she brought that up.

01:14:00.547 --> 01:14:02.333
Do you think she was wary of Ye Eun?

01:14:02.357 --> 01:14:05.257
Or do you think she didn't
mean anything by that?

01:14:05.757 --> 01:14:08.803
I think she said that to sound
him out for many reasons.

01:14:08.827 --> 01:14:10.173
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, for many reasons.

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:12.273
So you think she was wary of Ye Eun.

01:14:12.297 --> 01:14:14.527
Yes, and she wanted
to hear from Sang Won

01:14:15.067 --> 01:14:16.137
about why he did it.

01:14:16.637 --> 01:14:17.973
She wanted to know if he
was just kind to Ye Eun,

01:14:17.997 --> 01:14:19.783
or it was because he was interested in her.

01:14:19.807 --> 01:14:22.237
I think she subtly sounded him out.

01:14:22.577 --> 01:14:25.983
Sang Won answered
her question quite wisely.

01:14:26.007 --> 01:14:29.453
He said he always tried to
memorize the preferences

01:14:29.477 --> 01:14:32.623
of someone he was interested in.

01:14:32.647 --> 01:14:34.463
And then he said he had memorized that

01:14:34.487 --> 01:14:35.464
- she prefered regular Coke.
- He memorized it.

01:14:35.488 --> 01:14:37.893
He promised to get regular
Coke for her in the future.

01:14:37.917 --> 01:14:40.933
So if he buys regular
Coke, Ji Won will wonder

01:14:40.957 --> 01:14:43.373
if he bought it for her.

01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:46.043
- She'll know he cares about her.
- He made her think that way.

01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:48.597
I'm worried he might buy
both regular Coke and wasabi.

01:14:49.097 --> 01:14:50.913
- There may be more items to buy.
- Exactly.

01:14:50.937 --> 01:14:52.783
- Wasabi, regular Coke, and...
- That'll drive the girls crazy.

01:14:52.807 --> 01:14:56.237
Right. That's what worries me, but...

01:14:57.607 --> 01:14:59.183
- It looks good.
- Actually

01:14:59.207 --> 01:15:01.207
I haven't had this type
of pork cutlet in a while.

01:15:02.077 --> 01:15:03.517
(Having a bite)

01:15:03.647 --> 01:15:06.017
(Impressed)

01:15:08.687 --> 01:15:10.957
Didn't you say you'd do
something regarding makgeolli?

01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:15.257
Ye Eun and I made makgeolli together

01:15:15.797 --> 01:15:17.097
on the second day.

01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:20.497
We were told to stir the makgeolli
on the third day after making it.

01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:22.243
(Bothered)

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.137
Who takes that makgeolli then?

01:15:24.837 --> 01:15:26.637
I guess we will each take one.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:28.667
Shouldn't we do that?

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:30.853
I can't take all.

01:15:30.877 --> 01:15:32.153
- Are there 2 bottles?
- Yes, there are 2 bottles.

01:15:32.177 --> 01:15:33.847
- There are 2 bottles.
- We each made 1.

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:35.793
Right. You didn't know
that we each made one.

01:15:35.817 --> 01:15:36.817
No.

01:15:37.577 --> 01:15:39.623
Sang Won, while you're here,

01:15:39.647 --> 01:15:43.757
is there anyone else you want to

01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:46.757
get to know?

01:15:48.927 --> 01:15:50.647
I think he's going to say there is someone.

01:15:52.057 --> 01:15:54.243
- The nightmare of a test.
- I think he's going to say it.

01:15:54.267 --> 01:15:55.307
- It's a nightmare.
- Yes.

01:15:56.597 --> 01:15:58.797
To be honest, there was
someone I wanted to talk to.

01:15:59.807 --> 01:16:04.337
Right now, it's a mere curiosity.

01:16:04.437 --> 01:16:05.577
That's about it.

01:16:06.407 --> 01:16:09.247
But there isn't much time left,

01:16:09.547 --> 01:16:13.147
so I mean to resolve that
curiosity as soon as I can.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.663
That way, I can communicate my
emotion in a more stable manner.

01:16:16.687 --> 01:16:18.567
That's what I've been
thinking since yesterday.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.187
I don't want to be lost.

01:16:23.727 --> 01:16:27.173
(While they're on a date, )

01:16:27.197 --> 01:16:31.697
(another person waits for Sang Won.)

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:36.677
(What will happen to
their relationships next?)

01:16:38.077 --> 01:16:41.347
(Sang Won has the second
Memory Location Date with Ye Eun.)

01:16:42.677 --> 01:16:44.577
(Did you know I was
going to be on two dates?)

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:48.117
(I hoped you wouldn't go on two dates.)

01:16:49.117 --> 01:16:51.663
(After going on dates with the two, )

01:16:51.687 --> 01:16:53.757
(I felt the difference instantly.)

01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:56.033
(What I loved about...)

01:16:56.057 --> 01:16:57.627
(today's dates is...)

01:16:58.357 --> 01:17:01.827
(that I got to compare them instantly.)

01:17:02.397 --> 01:17:05.273
(Did you not talk to Sang Won?)

01:17:05.297 --> 01:17:08.167
(About how he studied?)

01:17:08.637 --> 01:17:11.137
(I didn't ask him about it in detail.)

01:17:12.177 --> 01:17:15.717
(After the date, they start
keeping each other in check.)

01:17:17.417 --> 01:17:20.123
(Honestly, )

01:17:20.147 --> 01:17:21.387
(I am not too happy about it.)

01:17:21.647 --> 01:17:22.917
Knock, knock.

01:17:23.687 --> 01:17:30.657
(Ji Won appears, and
their conversation stops.)

01:17:31.997 --> 01:17:33.467
(Sighing)

01:17:34.127 --> 01:17:38.067
(We share the same struggles, )

01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:41.967
(and we are also rivals,
fighting with good intentions.)

01:17:42.677 --> 01:17:45.107
(Sang Won will make the decision.)

01:17:46.407 --> 01:17:49.277
(Who will Sang Won's heart lean toward?)
