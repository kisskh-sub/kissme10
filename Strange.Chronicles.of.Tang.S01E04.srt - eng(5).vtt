[Episode 4]

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.070
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.300
Am I free now?

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.980
Am I finally free?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.200
Thank you, Officers.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.320
Thank you all.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.170
I can't wait

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.960
to visit the East Market,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.830
eat a bowl of Xiao's wontons,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.310
and buy myself some decent clothes.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.990
And then

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.630
have some fun in the Pingkang District.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870
I go to the Pingkang District

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.940
just to listen to the songstresses

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.940
playing the pipa.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.490
It's been months

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.920
since I heard any music.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.310
I really can't stand it anymore.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.759
Did you really not write the blood letter?

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.560
No, I didn't.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.610
Why don't you check again?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.840
Biting my finger would hurt so much.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.440
I can't bring myself to do it.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.910
Write down your name.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.920
Why?

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.120
Cut the crap.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.920
Is this a place for you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920
to ask questions?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.750
I'll write it. I'll write it.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.000
[Xie Xia]

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.040
Why did those 3 women

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.470
imprison you?

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.800
They are bad people.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.990
Then how did you get

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.560
the nickname "Woe-Reliever"?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.960
I...

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.280
Yeah,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.950
it's my fault.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.520
I seduced them first.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.079
I admit that.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000
Later, I wanted to leave,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.130
but I couldn't get away.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.810
You brought this on yourself.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.579
With such poor character,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.430
you don't deserve
to become a jinshi scholar.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.830
Go back to your hometown!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.530
I could tell at first glance

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.020
that the blood letter
wasn't written by him.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.100
But what I want to say

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.680
is whoever wrote that blood letter

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.710
must be a scholar.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.430
Writing with blood

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.840
and still making such neat letters

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
isn't easy at all.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.710
I understand.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.480
Thank you for your work.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.140
[Honesty and Diligence]

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.600
The 3 women are neighbors,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.910
all widows.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.400
Is this kind of situation

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000
common in the Xiuzhen District?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.660
Not common.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.000
I believe this would be unusual

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.060
anywhere else too.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.850
Have they always lived there?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.690
Not exactly.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.079
Cong has lived

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.110
in the Xiuzhen District since childhood.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.370
She married a live-in man.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.829
That man was quite honest.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.960
Later on,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.190
he caught an unknown illness

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.750
and died.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.310
As for Manniang and Hua,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.280
they moved here in the past few years.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Manniang came earlier,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.030
and Hua

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.370
a few months later.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.080
Was Cong's husband

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120
still alive then?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.340
I need to think about that carefully.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.190
In the glorious capital,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.860
you dared to imprison someone as a slave.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.000
What punishment do you deserve?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.290
Captain Xue.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.159
They're not answering.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.270
Apply torture!

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.270
Apply torture!

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.610
I am the mastermind.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.950
The underground chamber is in my house.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.870
The idea of imprisoning Xie You

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.680
was also mine.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.750
These 2 had nothing to do with it.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.150
Having Manniang and Hua

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.670
move in as your neighbors

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.460
was also your idea, wasn't it?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.750
How did your husband die?

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.600
Take her away.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.360
Yes!

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.080
Manniang.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.070
Your martial skills are impressive.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.730
How many lives have you taken?

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.870
Take her away too.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.450
Yes!

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.510
[Loyalty]

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.390
Hua!

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.440
I...

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.840
I'm just an accomplice.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.830
I was an assassin before,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.450
but I only assisted others.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.420
I've never killed anyone myself!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.210
If I didn't have evidence,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.820
would I let you stay alone?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.430
You killed Cong's husband,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.510
didn't you?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.870
No, no, I didn't kill him!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.000
It was Manniang!

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.630
Manniang

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.800
was the handler for Cong and me.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.630
Because of my carelessness,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.800
Cong's husband

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.230
found out about our past.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.070
Manniang didn't even give a warning

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.130
before she struck.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.830
His blood splattered all over me.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.070
It was terrifying.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.210
What happened in the past?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.390
Nothing important.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.680
Not talking?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.390
Luo, Jia, Liu!

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.680
Silence!

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.630
I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.120
Manniang

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.830
was an assassin from the Crimson Pact.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.400
Cong and I were her subordinates.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.080
How did you find the flaw?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.120
When you went mushroom picking
at Leyouyuan

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.480
to celebrate his birthday,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.610
he had supposedly moved away already.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.160
It's all because of Hua's big mouth.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.900
Of course, it's also my fault.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.980
I was seduced by the Woe-Reliever

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.140
and ended up like this.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.200
About the Crimson Pact,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.080
I won't say anything.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.970
Just cut off my head!

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.070
Yingtao,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.080
you're a heroine.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.920
When you were saving Su Wuming,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.480
you weren't afraid of death.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.480
And you're now afraid
of my mere acupuncture needles?

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.960
Don't move. Don't move.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.130
Done.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.750
Although I've removed the needles,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.880
you should still lie down a bit longer.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.450
Don't worry.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.870
With me here,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.590
everything will be fine.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.720
Yingtao used all her strength

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.920
to protect me.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.360
Those 2 assassins, a man and a woman,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.310
were highly skilled in martial arts.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.160
I've been thinking,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.430
but I can't figure it out.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.510
I have no enemies.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.310
Who would want to kill me?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.460
How did you all
get involved with assassins?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.190
Those 3 women,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.800
though ordinary in martial arts,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.600
have been confirmed
to be Crimson Pact assassins.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.020
Ordinary in martial arts?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.360
They're just minions at best.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.390
What are minions?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.600
Minions

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.920
are part of the Crimson Pact

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.169
but not really assassins.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.090
They can develop their own subordinates

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.750
but have only one direct handler.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.070
If they lose contact

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.370
with their handler,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.380
they'll become abandoned pieces

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.080
and can never find
their assassin group again.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.390
The core assassins of the Crimson Pact

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.840
are either highly skilled martial artists

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.840
or experts with extraordinary abilities,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.030
including those who excel in poisoning

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.750
or illusion.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.120
In short,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.290
their common characteristic

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.600
is that they're all extremely arrogant.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.360
Assassins of high caliber like Beacon Fire

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.390
and Silent Ember

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.310
naturally have

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.160
all kinds of business

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.970
from clients seeking them out.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.680
But if the target

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.430
is just an ordinary nobody,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.670
even if you offer them a fortune,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.650
they won't do the job themselves.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.810
That's why they have minions

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.600
handle the minor tasks.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.890
Some masters even train

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960
their disciples to become minions.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.900
I must say, Mr. Fei,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.030
you seem to know

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.290
quite a lot about this.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.840
Of course I do.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.450
After all, I once treated

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.810
Silent Ember's wounds.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.440
Su Wuming.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.000
Why don't you

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.120
take another look at this thing?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.420
You said it's 15 days old,

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.830
but Mr. Fei suggested

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.300
it's 5 days old.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.880
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.120
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.590
The bloodstains seeped into the linen,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.490
winding like trails left by earthworms
crawling through mud.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.630
Though it was just a quick assessment
back then,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.150
it seems correct now.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.910
Something this completely dried out

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.120
and brittle

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.320
should be at least 15 days old, right?

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.200
Su Wuming,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.720
you've learned well from Master Di.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.030
When criminals leave traces,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.920
they can't escape your keen eye.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.400
But when it comes to human blood,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.380
I have seen

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.300
more than most.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.440
I didn't just guess it was 5 days old.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.880
I smelled it.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.250
Try it yourself.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.440
Your noses aren't good enough.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.350
Haven't you smelled the blood?

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.030
No, I haven't.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.600
Scrape off a bit more

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.320
and dissolve it in water, then smell.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.880
Especially the word

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.160
"Relieve."

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.810
The first 2 words "Save Lives"

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.510
are clearly lighter
than the following words.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.000
This is because the blood was still thin

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.240
at the initial stage of writing,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.440
requiring the writer

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.670
to bite his fingertips repeatedly.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:40.960
[Save Lives, Relieve Woes]

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.750
Look, it turns as red as cinnabar

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.240
toward the end.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.010
My mentor Sun Simiao once said

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.910
once drawn from the body, human blood will
develop a putrid odor after 3 days

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.600
and decompose by the fifth.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.800
Now, smell the blood in the water again.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.630
There is indeed a faint putrid odor.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.360
This is a sign that the vital essence
in the blood hasn't dispersed.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.000
According to
the "Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon,"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.600
based on the principles
of blood decomposition,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.550
it is definitely no more than 5 days old,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.390
likely between 3 and 5 days old.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.910
But the cracking level of these words...

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.030
I understand now.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.960
Recently, the Maestros of Rain in Chang'an

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.080
have all been praying for rain,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.030
which only came this afternoon.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.080
The robe

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.480
was hanging in Ascension Forest.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.510
The robe was exposed to wind and sun,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.540
which accelerated its drying.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.970
That's why

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.600
this blood writing
that's only a few days old

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.480
appears

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.960
to be half a month old.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.930
That's right.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.640
Thank you, Miracle Doctor Fei,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.520
for correcting my misjudgment.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.630
No need for that.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.480
We're a team.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.730
Such a grand gesture

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.550
might shorten my life.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.840
In the future,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.030
if there's anything you don't understand,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.860
just ask me.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.200
I'll give you some guidance anytime.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.670
Alright,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.990
both of you, sit down.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.370
Whether it's 15 or 5 days old,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.210
the leads have gone cold on both sides.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.000
Didn't we capture

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.330
the 3 female assassins?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.260
That's quite an achievement.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.970
What a coincidence.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.720
Today, when I left the district office,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.600
I ran into Mr. Hou from Hero Restaurant.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.640
So I ordered

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.470
some of their signature dishes.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.950
They should arrive soon.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.960
How about we have a few drinks?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.430
A few drinks sounds good.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.740
A few drinks can help blood circulation,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.680
which is perfect

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.320
for my back to heal faster.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.670
Ruan Daxiong has gone beyond the border.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.270
Mr. Hou is running the restaurant alone.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.420
He must be very busy.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.510
The restaurant is already short-staffed.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.360
And you've made them

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.790
deliver food all the way here.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.600
Won't that interfere with

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.260
Hero Restaurant's business?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.080
It sounds like

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.150
Official Lu has invested

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.430
in Hero Restaurant.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.010
Besides,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.670
I wouldn't have

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.910
their staff deliver it.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.960
I hired an errand service to pick it up.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.910
Everyone's been so busy lately.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.200
Lu Lingfeng and Xue Huan
used to stay at the district office,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.800
so it's rare for us to gather.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.720
There's no time to cook,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.200
so this is the best I can do.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.480
I've already asked Xue Huan

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.750
to buy some good wine.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.550
Xijun, you really understand me.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.960
My gold-plated silver flask

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.370
with a dancing horse pattern

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.650
is already empty.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.670
Doesn't the name
I came up with for this flask,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.530
the one Xijun gave me, sound nice?

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.870
It's nice,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.770
but just a bit of a mouthful.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.670
According to my original plan,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.360
tomorrow, the district circuit
shall take place in the Xiuzhen District.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.030
I hope

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.000
I can find some useful clues.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.140
So I won't drink today.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.240
The recent cases we've investigated

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.670
and situations we've encountered

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.020
are all related to this Xiuzhen District.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.840
How about I go with you tomorrow?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.460
You volunteered to go,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.480
so don't complain.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.870
For the sake of the investigation,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.470
when have I ever complained?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.000
Thank you for your work.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.200
Here's your fee.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.320
Thank you, Miss.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.180
To be honest,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.150
I've been working as an errand runner

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.080
for over 6 months now,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.670
but this is my first time delivering food.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.030
On my way here, I was wondering

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.360
who would be rich enough

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.550
to have just a few dishes

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.870
delivered from outside Kaiyuan Gate,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.550
all the way across half of Chang'an.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.480
Little did I know

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.480
you were going to host

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480
the renowned disciple of Master Di.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.320
I've seen Official Lu before.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.870
On district circuit for cases,
he cuts an imposing figure

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.320
and is so kind to us common folk.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.400
This errand trip

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.840
is definitely worth it.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.910
Here,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.040
this is from Official Lu for you.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.240
Thank you, Miss.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.040
Thank you, Official Lu.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.370
Please enjoy your meal.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.200
I'll be on my way now.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.440
I have more deliveries to make.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.040
Farewell.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.530
For an official,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.280
earning the people's approval

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.750
is the greatest joy.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.720
How about you have a few drinks tonight?

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.390
Just a small drink,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.320
not enough to affect
the district circuit tomorrow.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.390
Well then,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.280
a small drink?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.320
A small drink.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.600
In my entire life,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.150
I hate nothing
more than the words "small drink."

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.810
It reeks of pretentiousness.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.320
You 2 can have your small drink.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.320
I shall drink heartily with others.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.330
If we're drinking, let's drink properly!

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.320
Let's go.
