WEBVTT

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.708
(Sang Won asked to talk to Ji
Won, whom he was curious about.)

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.224
(Judging by how bothered I was, )

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:12.724
(I thought it'd be best...)

00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.178
(to ask about your feelings.)

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.094
(I've wanted to get to know you better...)

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.188
(and to talk to you more.)

00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:24.058
(Ji Won is now as curious about Sang Won.)

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.304
(That night)

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:29.128
(A chat between the two,
with Ye Eun in the middle)

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:30.604
- You don't have it?
- No, I have it.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.074
(Me too.)

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.268
You know what it is, right?

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:38.038
(The two keep talking
despite Ye Eun's interruptions.)

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:40.978
Does it disappear?

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:44.284
(Changing the topic)

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:45.478
(Right, we need to do that.)

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.648
(Bewildered)

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:52.718
(Ye Eun takes Sang Won inside.)

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:57.088
(A strange air between the
older women regarding Sang Won)

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.628
(After the chaotic night)

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.334
(Memory Location Date)

00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:03.974
(Put an old photo of
yourself in the drawer...)

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.428
(of the younger man you
want to go on a date with.)

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.768
(Bon Hee chose Mu Jin.)

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:14.454
(Chosen by two older
women were Sang Won...)

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:17.748
(and Sang Hyeon.)

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.024
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin have
a date at an art museum.)

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.348
(I've never had couple's rings before.)

00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:27.918
(Why didn't you have one until now?)

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:31.958
(I wanted to get one when I got married.)

00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:35.858
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon have
a date at an amusement park.)

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.868
(So Hyun keeps getting
close to Sang Hyeon.)

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:43.138
(So Hyun flirts with her
older-woman charm.)

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:45.644
(I would've had fun there
no matter whom I was with.)

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.414
(The place made me feel
like I was in a relationship.)

00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:53.248
(Ji Won and Sang Won
have a date at Mount Nam.)

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:56.148
(Don't think you're not splendid now.)

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:58.118
(You're shining brightly now.)

00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:01.258
(Impressed)

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:04.304
(Ji Won's feelings toward
Sang Won grow bigger.)

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:05.934
(Was each of you allowed
to put in only one photo?)

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:06.964
(Or several photos?)

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:08.034
(Only one photo.)

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:09.035
- Really?
- Yes.

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.528
(Did you have one photo in your drawer?)

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.768
(There were two photos in my drawer.)

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.114
(Who do you think the other one was?)

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:17.568
(I think it was Ye Eun.)

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:20.344
(I didn't ask him who it was, )

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:21.808
(but I knew it was her.)

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.724
(As her feelings have grown,
Ji Won is bothered by Ye Eun.)

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.318
(And Ye Eun is waiting for Sang Won.)

00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:30.788
(To whom will Sang Won's feelings go to?)

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:33.548
We're getting too
emotionally invested here

00:02:33.648 --> 00:02:35.264
- every week.
- Yes, we are.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.434
What's going on?

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.864
Unexpected people
are falling for each other.

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:41.074
- I know, right?
- I'm relieved that So Hyun

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:43.434
is making a move on
Sang Hyeon passionately.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:46.074
I hope things go well between the two.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.944
But I also wonder when
Sang Hyeon will express

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.574
- his feelings properly.
- Same.

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:53.138
Right? It's kind of...

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:55.684
No matter who it is,

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.654
I want Sang Hyeon

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.384
to approach someone boldly.

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:04.188
By the way, Director Park...

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:06.618
- That's hilarious.
- Why does he make me laugh?

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.034
Modifiers like straggler and no-vote guy

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.704
always followed him around.

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:14.898
But now, he's a younger man
being loved by two older women.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.504
Now then, Ji Won and
Sang Won went on their date.

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:20.374
He still has a second date left.

00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:23.238
- That's right.
- Let's check out who his date is.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.078
She's sitting on that
bench like a painting.

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:29.815
Who is it?

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:36.748
(The older woman waiting for
the younger man on a green lawn)

00:03:37.948 --> 00:03:39.694
(And the younger man approaches.)

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:40.934
Sang Won?

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.088
(Sang Won)

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:51.298
Did I keep you waiting?

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:58.684
(The 2nd photo among
the 2 in Sang Won's drawer)

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.314
(Ye Eun)

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:02.878
It's Ye Eun.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.878
Today, I planned

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:11.594
to go to Seoul Arts High
School, where I graduated.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:12.595
(Ye Eun's memory location
is Seoul Arts High School.)

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.558
To me, it's a meaningful place.

00:04:16.058 --> 00:04:17.688
And I thought I should visit it

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:22.528
with someone I have feelings for.

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:25.574
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.044
(Nodding)

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:28.098
Oh, dear.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.898
You're on the lawn.

00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:31.938
Didn't any mosquitoes bite you?

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:33.538
No.

00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:35.684
Is this you?

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.978
Yes, did you find me?

00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:40.224
It was easy because I
only had to find the one

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:41.448
with the smallest head.

00:04:42.878 --> 00:04:44.218
He's right.

00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:47.248
- Yes, her head is tiny.
- How pretty.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.568
- Let's look around.
- Can we tour around?

00:04:49.758 --> 00:04:50.764
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:52.034
- Good.
- Unless you graduate

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.538
from that school, you wouldn't visit.

00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:55.498
What?

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:58.198
I didn't know arts high
schools had a sports field.

00:04:58.328 --> 00:04:59.928
- We have one.
- Do you have P.E.?

00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.598
Yes, we do.

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:03.538
- You do?
- It's one of the subjects.

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.008
The school is huge.

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:08.478
It's like a college campus.

00:05:10.608 --> 00:05:12.054
(Looking around)

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.854
They must be looking
for something to sit on.

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:15.148
There aren't any clean spots.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.194
Is this okay? How about we try over there?

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:19.988
It looks the cleanest. Let me have a look.

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.518
This seems the cleanest.

00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:25.804
(Brushing off)

00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:26.988
- Oh, my.
- This should do.

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:29.128
Thanks.

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:30.698
Let's take a seat.

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:34.338
This seems like the cleanest spot.

00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:37.238
It's nice how Sang Won
is dusting off the stair.

00:05:37.968 --> 00:05:39.614
And I just had to wear white pants.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:40.978
Exactly. But your outfit

00:05:41.138 --> 00:05:42.938
looks like an invited professor.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:47.208
- You know... How do I put it?
- Do I look weird?

00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:50.624
- How do I put it?
- Do I look weird?

00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:52.188
No, it's not weird. I swear it's not.

00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:55.664
- It's a very elegant outfit.
- Is it a very elegant outfit?

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.858
- Yes.
- I see.

00:05:57.058 --> 00:05:58.658
How did you feel after being chosen?

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.398
I was happy and grateful, of course.

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:05.644
Honestly,

00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:07.768
little did I imagine I'd go on two dates.

00:06:08.298 --> 00:06:10.668
That's why... Did you
know I'd go on two dates?

00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:16.978
I hoped you wouldn't.

00:06:18.348 --> 00:06:20.848
I heard you had to put it in
the drawer inside in person.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:22.848
And so...

00:06:25.448 --> 00:06:28.588
You would've guessed so since I was late.

00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:32.458
I knew. I waited knowing about it.

00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:35.258
I waited despite knowing it.

00:06:36.758 --> 00:06:39.698
- What a lovely reaction.
- I see.

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:41.374
My apologies for making you wait.

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:43.174
- Gosh, no.
- I'm sorry.

00:06:43.198 --> 00:06:44.938
- I...
- Especially when I'm not special.

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.638
Don't you think Ye Eun has changed?

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:51.778
Ye Eun has always wanted Sang Won.

00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:55.578
(A little while later in Yeon House)

00:06:57.148 --> 00:06:58.648
Where did you go, Ji Won?

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:00.518
Mount Nam.

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:01.958
It was really nice.

00:07:03.518 --> 00:07:05.764
- I had fun too.
- It looked like it.

00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:07.458
I heard stories from Sang Won.

00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:12.598
(Reading the room)

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:16.374
Did you not talk with Sang Won?

00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:17.708
Like

00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:20.308
how Sang Won studied?

00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:22.078
- How Sang Won studied?
- Yes.

00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:25.348
I didn't ask him detailed questions.

00:07:26.548 --> 00:07:28.754
But I could tell the kind of life

00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:32.288
he lived through one answer from him.

00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:36.388
(Smiling)

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:38.788
(Smiling)

00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.674
(A tense standoff between
the two older women...)

00:07:41.698 --> 00:07:45.768
(who have gone on a date with Sang Won)

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:52.144
(Will Ye Eun be able to win
Sang Won's heart on this date?)

00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:54.238
Did you eat?

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.338
Near the school...

00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:58.448
What was it?

00:07:58.808 --> 00:08:01.448
I went there almost every
day when attending

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.024
- Seoul Arts High School.
- Your favorite place?

00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:07.288
Yes, it's a restaurant right
below the dance studio.

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:10.158
How about we check out the place?

00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:11.528
I'm in.

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:13.664
Let's visit your nostalgic restaurant.

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:15.034
I have a feeling it'd be snack bar food.

00:08:15.058 --> 00:08:16.874
- How did you know?
- If it's your nostalgic food.

00:08:16.898 --> 00:08:18.028
I'm surprised.

00:08:19.568 --> 00:08:23.668
(The sun has set.)

00:08:24.508 --> 00:08:26.184
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:27.384
- Director Park.
- Is this the place?

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:28.614
- That was unexpected.
- This is

00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:30.254
- the place.
- Being thoughtful...

00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:31.908
- Okay.
- Is second nature to Sang Won.

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.378
Right.

00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:36.954
- So he's actually like that.
- Hi.

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:38.394
Hi.

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:39.664
(Ye Eun's Seoul Arts High School
era favorite place with Sang Won)

00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:41.118
It's giving off high school vibes.

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:43.994
Look around closely,
and I'm sure you'll find one.

00:08:44.018 --> 00:08:46.288
Ye Eun must also find it new.

00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:48.204
When was the last time you came here?

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:49.748
You haven't been here in years, right?

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:51.898
It's my first time after graduating.

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:55.438
I wanted to drop by when
I visited my school before,

00:08:55.738 --> 00:08:57.238
but it was closed then.

00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:00.838
It was a bummer I couldn't
eat, but I'm glad I can today.

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:04.284
I'm getting excited. I
haven't had snack bar food

00:09:04.308 --> 00:09:05.754
in such a long time.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.755
(Really?)

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.618
I'm not someone who loves tteokbokki.

00:09:09.718 --> 00:09:11.488
I try to avoid it because I know it's good.

00:09:11.988 --> 00:09:13.468
As you know, the seasoning is strong.

00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:16.358
You worked out like crazy yesterday.

00:09:17.158 --> 00:09:18.158
Three minutes?

00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:22.098
- Literally three minutes.
- But I was genuinely surprised.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.374
Really? All the men and women

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:25.628
are saying that to me.

00:09:26.068 --> 00:09:27.198
You did well.

00:09:27.498 --> 00:09:28.574
She must've fallen for him.

00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:30.038
It was unexpected from him.

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:31.714
He had the best posture.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:35.954
His chest was open,
which was quite a shocker.

00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:37.208
Yes, he had the best posture.

00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.424
Three, four, five, - You
never know what'll happen.

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:40.554
- Six...
- Who knew Ye Eun

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:41.724
would fall for that?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.848
Nobody foresaw it.

00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:45.964
- Was I not that bad?
- It wasn't "not that bad."

00:09:45.988 --> 00:09:47.688
Is that so? I'm glad.

00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:52.088
You kept saying, "I can't do
it." But when you did the pull-up,

00:09:52.488 --> 00:09:53.704
you had amazing posture.

00:09:53.728 --> 00:09:56.928
I was right next to the fitness equipment.

00:09:57.258 --> 00:09:59.768
"For real?" That was the first surprise.

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:01.698
You were good.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.288
- You were even good at sit-ups.
- She has fallen for him.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.744
The push-ups really surprised me.

00:10:06.768 --> 00:10:08.678
- She has fallen head over heels.
- Totally.

00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:12.308
Until now, Sang Won has been underrated.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.654
- He's been underrated.
- "Underrated?"

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:15.918
She's right. Sang Won is
an extraordinary person.

00:10:16.578 --> 00:10:19.048
Everyone was going all
out, so I got absorbed...

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.988
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:22.858
- Thank you.
- It looks good.

00:10:23.318 --> 00:10:24.934
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.238
- Thank you.
- It's on the side.

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:28.734
Should I dish some out?

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.528
No, we can just

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:32.704
I haven't used the chopsticks yet.

00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:34.568
(Dishing some food for Ye Eun)

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.914
- We could've just dug in.
- What?

00:10:36.938 --> 00:10:38.414
(Feeling shy)

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.044
We'll probably end up like that

00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:41.108
- over time.
- True.

00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:43.014
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.108
Of course.

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.508
I thought you wouldn't
like snack bar food

00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:48.548
since you'd have to watch what you eat.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.254
You liked it when you were a student.

00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:51.894
(Eating)

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:53.288
I'm a big eater.

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:58.128
There's no end to taking care of my body.

00:10:59.228 --> 00:11:00.258
It's good.

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:02.758
- Right?
- High school girls

00:11:02.998 --> 00:11:04.698
must love this place.

00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:07.398
I bet they wouldn't want school food.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:09.968
Delicious.

00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:14.068
Since we're at my old school...

00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:19.748
The reason I chose this place was that

00:11:19.948 --> 00:11:22.078
I almost couldn't attend this school.

00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:24.464
Why? Because of financial reasons?

00:11:24.488 --> 00:11:25.548
Yes, financial reasons.

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.258
At the time,

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:32.458
our family went through a very hard time.

00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:37.658
So, they told me that I couldn't

00:11:38.028 --> 00:11:39.068
do ballet anymore.

00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:44.068
We started living in a container home

00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:46.368
with 1 room and 1 bathroom.

00:11:47.338 --> 00:11:49.108
I used to cry every night

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:51.748
in the bathroom with the water running.

00:11:51.948 --> 00:11:53.948
But I guess they heard that.

00:11:54.048 --> 00:11:55.025
Your parents heard that?

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:56.178
(Nodding)

00:11:56.748 --> 00:12:00.618
After some time, she said to me,

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:04.758
"Ye Eun, I'll figure out a way to fix this."

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.828
"I'll find a way,"

00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:13.498
"so go to the arts high
school and keep doing ballet."

00:12:13.598 --> 00:12:16.738
That's why... You know,

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.798
until I joined the Korean National Ballet,

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.438
and became the principal dancer,

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.478
a lot had happened.

00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:32.918
But what drove me and motivated me

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.858
the most was

00:12:35.658 --> 00:12:38.688
the fact that my mom did
her best to support me

00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:40.788
in pursuing my dream.

00:12:43.498 --> 00:12:46.768
You could say it was
the most critical period.

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:49.798
And she supported you during that.

00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:53.738
I believe I have come this far,

00:12:53.968 --> 00:12:56.378
all thanks to her.

00:12:57.008 --> 00:13:00.348
That's why I picked this
as my memorable place.

00:13:02.378 --> 00:13:05.218
To tell you about myself,

00:13:05.748 --> 00:13:08.688
I had to tell you this story as well.

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:13.528
It must have been difficult

00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:15.898
to bring it up.

00:13:17.198 --> 00:13:18.928
Thanks for telling me.

00:13:21.298 --> 00:13:22.568
I also want to know about you.

00:13:27.108 --> 00:13:29.208
I was mostly influenced by my parents.

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:30.788
My father is a doctor, actually.

00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:33.784
I grew up watching that,

00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:36.524
and my parents obviously
believed it was a nice job,

00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:39.488
so I've had this vague
dream since my childhood.

00:13:40.188 --> 00:13:43.834
Then, I went to medical
school and communicated

00:13:43.858 --> 00:13:45.298
with all the professors and seniors,

00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:47.188
and I realized how cool being a doctor was.

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:51.198
I was thankful that I made
the decision to follow this path.

00:13:52.368 --> 00:13:54.944
And it suits me. That's all.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.214
- They're having serious chats.
- Yes.

00:13:57.238 --> 00:13:58.308
This is nice.

00:13:58.408 --> 00:13:59.438
That's cool.

00:14:00.468 --> 00:14:02.454
We all have different talents,

00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:04.254
and we chose different
paths to show for it.

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:06.378
(They got to know each other better.)

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.748
There's something that
can liven up the mood.

00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:12.324
How about a bite of spicy
stir-fried pork with rice?

00:14:12.348 --> 00:14:13.324
(You're unbelievable.)

00:14:13.348 --> 00:14:14.348
Is it too...

00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:15.734
(That was clever.)

00:14:15.758 --> 00:14:18.088
- Sang Won is clever.
- He is.

00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:19.228
- He's delightful.
- Yes.

00:14:19.328 --> 00:14:20.558
(That wasn't so bad.)

00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.934
- It got too depressed, didn't it?
- No, I loved it.

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.344
But it looked like you were feeling bad.

00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:27.698
I was worried things
were getting too serious.

00:14:28.098 --> 00:14:30.414
- I wanted you to tell me...
- Right.

00:14:30.438 --> 00:14:31.768
Comfortably.

00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:34.884
I was only trying to brighten up the mood.

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.054
You don't need to worry

00:14:37.078 --> 00:14:38.654
about bringing the mood down.

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.624
But I believed

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:43.624
that talking about these would help us

00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:45.448
feel more intimate.

00:14:46.888 --> 00:14:49.888
It's not something you tell everyone about.

00:14:51.118 --> 00:14:53.288
From my point of view,

00:14:53.758 --> 00:14:58.468
you may seem shallow on the outside...

00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:01.868
Or you pretend to be shallow.

00:15:02.438 --> 00:15:05.738
But I thought that you
were serious and thoughtful.

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:09.438
I'm thankful that you acknowledge it.

00:15:10.038 --> 00:15:12.754
Ye Eun seems more at ease now.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.518
(They feel more comfortable
than on their first date.)

00:15:17.378 --> 00:15:18.548
(Staring)

00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:21.968
You want to come back for more, don't you?

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.088
I'm sorry,

00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:26.388
but you said this was

00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:28.604
your first time coming
here after your graduation.

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:29.628
(Giggling)

00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:32.498
I wouldn't be able to tell
how long it's been for you,

00:15:33.498 --> 00:15:34.974
but if it took you this long to come back...

00:15:34.998 --> 00:15:36.074
Will you come back another time?

00:15:36.098 --> 00:15:39.538
(Asking again)

00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:42.614
(Nodding)

00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:43.708
If I get a chance.

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.648
If I get a chance. But

00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.648
I don't think you'll come back here.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:50.754
Will you come if I ask?

00:15:50.778 --> 00:15:52.164
(Nodding)

00:15:52.188 --> 00:15:53.348
Of course.

00:15:53.788 --> 00:15:55.734
(They promise to come back.)

00:15:55.758 --> 00:15:57.878
But it even took you all
this time to come back here.

00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:00.858
- How about, "We'll come back?"
- I like it.

00:16:02.058 --> 00:16:03.035
(Yenie and Wonie will come back!)

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.604
(Ye Eun wishes to go
on another date with him.)

00:16:06.628 --> 00:16:08.414
I hope I come back to Mount Nam soon.

00:16:08.438 --> 00:16:09.868
Will you come with me?

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:11.684
- Obviously. We're coming together.
- Really?

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:13.384
(Ji Won also wishes to go
on another date with him.)

00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:15.554
I was curious to know

00:16:15.578 --> 00:16:18.684
who I could talk to easily,

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:19.808
and communicate well with.

00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:22.718
I'm glad I realized who it was.

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:24.864
Oh, he realized?

00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:26.324
Who is it? I'm so curious.

00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:28.434
- So am I.
- Who's the girl?

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:29.958
(Who is Sang Won more interested in?)

00:16:30.888 --> 00:16:32.934
Did you go with Ji Won, then?

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:33.964
No.

00:16:33.988 --> 00:16:36.734
I drove from the Yeon
House to Seoul all by myself,

00:16:36.758 --> 00:16:37.898
and drove here from Seoul.

00:16:39.368 --> 00:16:42.574
Does that mean I'm the
only one who was in your car?

00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:45.168
Yes, I meant it when I said
that you were the only one.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.568
Did you fasten your seat belt?

00:16:47.768 --> 00:16:48.954
- Yes.
- That was quick.

00:16:48.978 --> 00:16:52.054
- Is it that meaningful?
- It is my habit.

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:53.608
She's just glad.

00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.148
It's not like she sat on his
lap. It was the passenger seat.

00:16:56.848 --> 00:16:58.664
Did another woman sit

00:16:58.688 --> 00:17:00.448
in his passenger seat or not?

00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:01.894
- Right.
- That's very meaningful.

00:17:01.918 --> 00:17:04.164
- It is.
- Not unless you sit on his lap.

00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:05.428
It's very significant.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.304
In the interview, Sang
Won said that he realized

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:12.074
who he was more interested in.

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.874
But he never told us who it was.

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:16.244
Right. Please tell us.

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:17.474
Who do you think it is?

00:17:17.498 --> 00:17:19.208
He sounded confident that he realized.

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:21.684
- I say it's Ji Won.
- Ji Won?

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.308
- Ji Won.
- Ji Won?

00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:25.208
I think it's Ye Eun.

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.954
Okay. We have one vote each.

00:17:27.978 --> 00:17:29.178
I also think it's Ji Won.

00:17:30.078 --> 00:17:31.394
I also think it's Ji Won.

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:32.624
I'm the only one who thinks it's Ye Eun?

00:17:32.648 --> 00:17:34.124
(Ji Won: 3, Ye Eun: 1)

00:17:34.148 --> 00:17:36.164
Maybe it's because he's tired,
but compared to the date

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:39.258
with Ji Won, his mood seemed down.

00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:42.574
When he was with Ji Won, it looked like

00:17:42.598 --> 00:17:45.004
- he was only listening...
- Was he?

00:17:45.028 --> 00:17:46.944
To Ji Won's story, and the date ended.

00:17:46.968 --> 00:17:47.968
That's also true.

00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:50.674
But with Ye Eun, - He
never told her about himself.

00:17:50.698 --> 00:17:51.914
He got to tell her about himself.

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:54.014
That might have changed things for him.

00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:55.554
- You have a point.
- Yes.

00:17:55.578 --> 00:17:56.954
(He told Ye Eun about
himself for the first time.)

00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:58.254
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin return to
the Yeon House after the date.)

00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:59.548
Bon Hee and Mu Jin.

00:18:01.508 --> 00:18:03.894
(Looking around)

00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:05.618
Do you have water in your car?

00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:07.018
I don't.

00:18:08.148 --> 00:18:11.334
(It looks like she's
coughing due to a cold.)

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:12.858
She's coming down with a cold.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.698
- Your throat hurts, doesn't it?
- I'm coughing because it itches.

00:18:17.758 --> 00:18:20.398
(She can't seem to stop coughing.)

00:18:21.228 --> 00:18:22.748
Should I turn off the air-conditioner?

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:24.598
(Nodding)

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:26.268
Don't you feel hot?

00:18:27.268 --> 00:18:28.308
I'm fine.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.308
Let's turn it back on when it feels hot.

00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:34.948
By the way,

00:18:36.518 --> 00:18:40.548
how would you feel if a
younger guy called you "noon a?"

00:18:43.158 --> 00:18:45.364
(You don't like it when a
guy calls you "noon a?")

00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:47.988
(I prefer it when he calls me by my name.)

00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.398
(Your hands are pretty.)

00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:53.428
(So are yours, noon a.)

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:57.738
(The word "noon a"
gave her a reality check.)

00:18:58.308 --> 00:19:00.884
Mu Jin was worried about that too.

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:02.784
- Right.
- He read her face.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.138
He did.

00:19:05.148 --> 00:19:08.818
"Noona?" That's why it felt
weird when you said it to me.

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.148
But I wouldn't mind it now.

00:19:13.148 --> 00:19:15.788
I never liked the idea

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:18.018
of calling you by your name

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.458
just to seem manly.

00:19:23.358 --> 00:19:25.528
But that doesn't mean I'd
keep calling you "noon a."

00:19:25.728 --> 00:19:28.568
I thought I called you that

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:30.068
only when it felt natural.

00:19:31.238 --> 00:19:33.668
You said that you've
dated a younger guy before.

00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:37.708
But he never called
me "noon a" at the time.

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:41.608
When I started dating older women,

00:19:42.718 --> 00:19:45.348
I never once called them "noon a."

00:19:47.348 --> 00:19:50.434
I usually called them by their names,

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:51.828
or called them "honey."

00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:53.828
- "Honey?"
- Yes.

00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:55.098
I've never said that before.

00:19:55.198 --> 00:19:57.628
- Seriously?
- I never...

00:19:58.598 --> 00:20:00.528
But it feels natural to me.

00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.098
Not that I'd use it right away.

00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:05.944
Oh, I see.

00:20:05.968 --> 00:20:09.138
I mostly called them by
their names or "honey."

00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:10.584
(Thinking)

00:20:10.608 --> 00:20:11.654
(Laughing)

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.308
I guess it's cringeworthy to you.

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:14.708
"Honey."

00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:18.594
I never even imagined saying it.

00:20:18.618 --> 00:20:20.024
- Really?
- Yes.

00:20:20.048 --> 00:20:21.288
(Unexpected)

00:20:21.718 --> 00:20:24.694
She might find it awkward
since she's never said it.

00:20:24.718 --> 00:20:26.424
(They have different
views about pet names.)

00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:28.986
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin
arrive at the Yeon House.)

00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:31.855
- I think I hear people.
- They're having a chat.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.950
They're outside.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.101
(Hi!)

00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:36.655
That's so cute!

00:20:37.397 --> 00:20:38.913
Look at those matching outfits.

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:39.943
What's that?

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:42.407
- You guys look so cute together.
- Do we?

00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:44.777
How was the date?

00:20:44.807 --> 00:20:46.037
Good.

00:20:47.377 --> 00:20:49.547
- Did you guys have fun?
- How was it?

00:20:49.607 --> 00:20:51.247
We had so much fun, didn't we?

00:20:51.347 --> 00:20:52.447
Sure.

00:20:53.077 --> 00:20:54.687
- The four of us.
- What?

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.563
- It was a double date.
- Yes.

00:20:56.587 --> 00:20:57.593
- A double date.
- Seriously?

00:20:57.617 --> 00:20:58.933
Yes, we just came back from a double date.

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:00.163
We went to an amusement park,

00:21:00.187 --> 00:21:01.657
- and went to Mount Nam.
- Right.

00:21:01.757 --> 00:21:03.477
- You're lying.
- What does that even mean?

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:08.343
You two must have been together all day.

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.344
- What did you do?
- Where did you go?

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:10.573
- We went to Chuncheon.
- Chuncheon!

00:21:10.597 --> 00:21:12.367
- Really?
- And we visited a gallery.

00:21:12.667 --> 00:21:14.543
- That sounds nice.
- An art gallery.

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:16.307
(Jealous)

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.037
Oh, and we made rings today.

00:21:19.837 --> 00:21:22.347
- Look at that!
- What?

00:21:22.677 --> 00:21:23.753
- What?
- What?

00:21:23.777 --> 00:21:25.053
Is this your first day as a couple?

00:21:25.077 --> 00:21:26.323
(Grinning)

00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:27.324
Yes.

00:21:27.348 --> 00:21:28.993
- What?
- Look at him!

00:21:29.017 --> 00:21:29.994
(Shy)

00:21:30.018 --> 00:21:31.663
You look so happy.

00:21:31.687 --> 00:21:33.393
But I sweated so much

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.403
- because of this cardigan.
- It could be engraved...

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:37.397
- Show us!
- By spinning it.

00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:38.773
- It's pretty.
- That sounds nice.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.203
- That's nice.
- You're a cute couple.

00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:42.627
When is your wedding?

00:21:42.697 --> 00:21:44.167
Stop it.

00:21:44.897 --> 00:21:46.213
You're making me want to punch you again.

00:21:46.237 --> 00:21:47.937
(Pondering)

00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:49.513
He's imagining it.

00:21:49.537 --> 00:21:50.813
(Nodding)

00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:52.007
(Laughing)

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:54.777
- You're so cheeky.
- He is.

00:21:56.577 --> 00:21:57.617
Okay.

00:21:57.777 --> 00:21:59.723
(Eating)

00:21:59.747 --> 00:22:02.963
(Yeon House)

00:22:02.987 --> 00:22:03.993
Good work today.

00:22:04.017 --> 00:22:06.417
Good work. Thank you
for waiting all that time.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.227
They're all outside.

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:13.457
We're back.

00:22:14.597 --> 00:22:16.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:18.297
How was the date?

00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:22.067
(It's a secret.)

00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:25.237
- Ji Won was watching.
- Yes.

00:22:28.607 --> 00:22:31.017
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:22:31.147 --> 00:22:32.317
How was the date?

00:22:32.777 --> 00:22:34.287
Yes. I stayed confident.

00:22:35.347 --> 00:22:37.657
- See you soon.
- See you.

00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:40.087
Oh, boy.

00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:42.033
(Impressed)

00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.287
Two dates?

00:22:45.157 --> 00:22:46.933
I drove for too long today.

00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:48.067
Sang Won!

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:49.467
What?

00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:51.867
So, you went on two dates?

00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.237
- Oh, you're back.
- Yes. I'm exhausted.

00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:02.147
I heard a rumor that you
went on two dates today.

00:23:02.907 --> 00:23:04.447
Everyone knows.

00:23:04.977 --> 00:23:06.117
That's hilarious.

00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:07.993
It hits harder

00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:09.393
- because he once got zero votes...
- Right.

00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:11.033
And had to stay at home.

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:12.417
He missed two dates in a row.

00:23:13.817 --> 00:23:15.287
Who were your dates?

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:17.857
- Ji Won and Ye Eun.
- How was it?

00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:20.997
Well,

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:23.627
I guess it was fun.

00:23:24.597 --> 00:23:27.137
It was a good chance to make up my mind.

00:23:27.337 --> 00:23:28.513
It helped me make a decision.

00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:30.807
- I still can't tell who it is.
- I wonder who.

00:23:31.277 --> 00:23:32.753
- What happened today?
- What?

00:23:32.777 --> 00:23:34.107
Why were you at home?

00:23:34.577 --> 00:23:36.807
Ji Yung picked me.

00:23:37.007 --> 00:23:38.847
- Ji Yung?
- Yes, I heard.

00:23:41.417 --> 00:23:43.117
I never expected that for Sang Hyeon.

00:23:43.747 --> 00:23:46.433
I was expecting him to go on
a date with either of the two.

00:23:46.457 --> 00:23:47.903
(Bon Hee or So Hyun)

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:50.697
I never thought he'd be
chosen by both of them.

00:23:51.827 --> 00:23:53.333
Hyeon Jun is upset.

00:23:53.357 --> 00:23:54.827
You probably never saw it coming.

00:23:55.127 --> 00:23:56.773
Well, I knew she had the right...

00:23:56.797 --> 00:23:58.837
- Right. Obviously.
- To get to know others.

00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:00.967
Why are you so cool about it?

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.767
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.407
For the first time ever, I believe you.

00:24:09.577 --> 00:24:10.823
- What do you mean?
- You said that you weren't sure

00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:12.293
- about how Yeong Gyeong felt.
- Yes.

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:15.463
I used to think that you
were saying that to be humble.

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:16.817
No, I honestly wasn't sure.

00:24:17.187 --> 00:24:20.217
I talked to Ye Eun a lot,
even on our way back home.

00:24:20.887 --> 00:24:24.357
Apparently, Yeong Gyeong
never thought about it that way.

00:24:24.527 --> 00:24:26.033
She never knew you were only going for her.

00:24:26.057 --> 00:24:27.034
- Me?
- Yes.

00:24:27.058 --> 00:24:28.797
She didn't know I was only after her?

00:24:29.127 --> 00:24:32.443
I heard that and realized why
you said it was complicated.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:33.743
- I don't know anything.
- You really couldn't

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:35.107
figure her out.

00:24:36.037 --> 00:24:40.377
(Was Yeong Gyeong actually
clueless about how Hyeon Jun felt?)

00:24:40.907 --> 00:24:43.383
(While Hyeon Jun waits at home...)

00:24:43.407 --> 00:24:44.477
It's Yeong Gyeong.

00:24:46.077 --> 00:24:48.393
She's dressed really young tonight.

00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:50.417
(Who did she choose for
the Memory Location Date?)

00:24:50.787 --> 00:24:51.887
(Hurrying)

00:24:54.227 --> 00:24:58.003
(The younger guy who came to her)

00:24:58.027 --> 00:25:02.627
(Sang Hyeon)

00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:05.237
(Smiling brightly)

00:25:06.497 --> 00:25:12.253
(The 2nd of the 2 photos
in Sang Hyeon's drawer)

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:14.123
(Yeong Gyeong)

00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:15.177
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:25:16.077 --> 00:25:17.077
Hi.

00:25:17.517 --> 00:25:18.553
Hi.

00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:20.447
(Shy)

00:25:20.547 --> 00:25:22.347
Do you know where we are?

00:25:22.747 --> 00:25:24.493
Yes. It's Korea University.

00:25:24.517 --> 00:25:25.663
(Yeong Gyeong's memorable
place, Korea University)

00:25:25.687 --> 00:25:26.863
- You're right.
- Why are you impressed?

00:25:26.887 --> 00:25:28.233
It's obviously Korea University.

00:25:28.257 --> 00:25:32.433
I was actually a student
ambassador during my time here.

00:25:32.457 --> 00:25:34.703
- Did you see the photo?
- Yes.

00:25:34.727 --> 00:25:36.703
- Did you?
- I did.

00:25:36.727 --> 00:25:37.737
That's the one.

00:25:37.867 --> 00:25:39.743
- It makes so much sense.
- Because she was so pretty.

00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:40.913
It's very convincing, right?

00:25:40.937 --> 00:25:42.813
(She used to be one of
the student ambassadors.)

00:25:42.837 --> 00:25:44.307
- That's why...
- Is this you?

00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:46.383
- That's why...
- Is this you?

00:25:46.407 --> 00:25:47.447
It is.

00:25:48.277 --> 00:25:49.623
- That's me.
- I've been trying

00:25:49.647 --> 00:25:50.653
- to find you.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:25:50.677 --> 00:25:53.953
It felt very strange, in fact.

00:25:53.977 --> 00:25:56.187
We dropped the honorifics today,

00:25:56.687 --> 00:25:59.017
and it felt more intimate.

00:26:00.357 --> 00:26:01.727
I wanted to

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:05.457
tell you more about myself today,

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:09.143
so I invited you to the place of my memory.

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:11.913
And it's where I spent my entire youth,

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.637
Korea University.

00:26:14.837 --> 00:26:16.367
- Did you write a script?
- No.

00:26:16.537 --> 00:26:17.613
Did you write it ahead of time?

00:26:17.637 --> 00:26:20.077
Reminiscing on my student ambassador days,

00:26:20.337 --> 00:26:22.253
I'll show you around campus.

00:26:22.277 --> 00:26:23.747
Really? Right now?

00:26:25.847 --> 00:26:27.687
We're going on a night walk.

00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:30.347
- Good. I love that.
- Do you?

00:26:31.187 --> 00:26:32.933
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:34.063
(Yeong Gyeong's Memory Location Date)

00:26:34.087 --> 00:26:35.207
(A tour of Korea University)

00:26:36.857 --> 00:26:37.873
It's pretty.

00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.697
- It's nice overall.
- Right?

00:26:40.497 --> 00:26:41.627
It's beautiful.

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:44.267
- Why don't I take a photo?
- Sure.

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.013
Like this?

00:26:47.037 --> 00:26:49.213
(He takes a photo of Yeong Gyeong.)

00:26:49.237 --> 00:26:50.237
All right.

00:26:50.707 --> 00:26:52.477
(Clicking)

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:57.377
- Do you want some more?
- No.

00:26:57.777 --> 00:26:59.417
I prefer taking photos together.

00:27:01.147 --> 00:27:02.917
- Let's take one together.
- Sure.

00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:10.503
(At Yeong Gyeong's place of memory, )

00:27:10.527 --> 00:27:14.827
(Sang Hyeon is there this time.)

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.267
You're very good at facial expressions.

00:27:17.897 --> 00:27:19.173
My face is cramping up.

00:27:19.197 --> 00:27:20.197
(A little embarrassed)

00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:21.607
It's a good photo.

00:27:22.037 --> 00:27:24.607
- Should we sit there for a moment?
- Should we?

00:27:27.547 --> 00:27:29.177
I needed a break.

00:27:29.807 --> 00:27:32.117
It's been so hectic since morning.

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:33.917
Did you have fun?

00:27:36.317 --> 00:27:38.657
- Well...
- Is going on two dates fun?

00:27:38.817 --> 00:27:40.093
"Going on two dates."

00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:42.257
It's not that easy. I'm exhausted.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:44.233
I tried to show you that
I was interested, though.

00:27:44.257 --> 00:27:46.257
- Did you?
- Didn't I?

00:27:47.827 --> 00:27:49.297
You did.

00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:51.097
You were also nice to me.

00:27:52.897 --> 00:27:56.807
(She gave him a lip balm.)

00:27:57.637 --> 00:27:59.483
Yeong Gyeong gave it to me as a gift.

00:27:59.507 --> 00:28:01.153
- I told her last time...
- Why would you brag about it

00:28:01.177 --> 00:28:02.277
in front of me?

00:28:03.177 --> 00:28:04.853
- Exactly.
- Sorry about that.

00:28:04.877 --> 00:28:05.877
(Sorry about that.)

00:28:07.317 --> 00:28:09.187
I'm actually wearing it right now.

00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:14.527
Did you apply it and go
on a date with another girl?

00:28:15.687 --> 00:28:16.687
(Startled)

00:28:18.327 --> 00:28:21.767
Your words are pretty aggressive.

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:23.627
(Laughing)

00:28:24.197 --> 00:28:26.213
Did you have dinner?

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.907
No, not yet.

00:28:28.367 --> 00:28:30.507
Still? Aren't you hungry?

00:28:30.707 --> 00:28:32.353
Did you have dinner with her too?

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.853
No, I didn't.

00:28:33.877 --> 00:28:35.653
- I didn't.
- Are you sure?

00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:37.523
"Did you have dinner with her too?"

00:28:37.547 --> 00:28:38.753
He can't look her in the eyes again.

00:28:38.777 --> 00:28:40.093
I didn't have dinner yet.

00:28:40.117 --> 00:28:41.947
(This is their second date.)

00:28:42.247 --> 00:28:44.117
I've been

00:28:45.257 --> 00:28:46.763
meaning to ask you.

00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:47.787
Okay.

00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:51.727
On our first date, I got the impression

00:28:53.027 --> 00:28:55.473
that you only saw me

00:28:55.497 --> 00:28:57.597
as a nice, younger guy.

00:28:57.867 --> 00:28:59.113
What are you talking about?

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.537
Her eyes were filled with love.

00:29:03.237 --> 00:29:05.813
(You're supposed to
tuck it into your collar.)

00:29:05.837 --> 00:29:07.107
(This is how you do it?)

00:29:07.647 --> 00:29:09.753
(Finding him cute)

00:29:09.777 --> 00:29:11.447
I get why he thought so, though.

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:15.887
The way she stared at him felt like,

00:29:16.547 --> 00:29:18.817
"Look at you eating!"

00:29:19.187 --> 00:29:22.203
But she was genuinely interested in him.

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:24.297
(When she showed her interest in him, )

00:29:26.427 --> 00:29:32.497
(he felt that she only saw
him as her little brother.)

00:29:32.767 --> 00:29:36.767
Right now, as I'm sitting here,

00:29:37.407 --> 00:29:38.707
from my point of view...

00:29:40.577 --> 00:29:43.207
(Curious)

00:29:45.647 --> 00:29:49.587
I guess I should say that I'm puzzled.

00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:53.117
- Really?
- Yes.

00:29:53.757 --> 00:29:55.927
Can I assume...

00:29:56.157 --> 00:29:57.157
Yes.

00:29:57.327 --> 00:30:01.567
That you like me?

00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:11.707
I'm not sure how you feel.

00:30:13.807 --> 00:30:15.707
Because he thought that
she was into Hyeon Jun.

00:30:16.647 --> 00:30:17.653
- That too.
- Maybe he did.

00:30:17.677 --> 00:30:21.147
Also, she never directly
showed that she liked him.

00:30:21.447 --> 00:30:23.187
Even though they went on a date,

00:30:23.687 --> 00:30:25.863
how Yeong Gyeong felt about Sang Hyeon

00:30:25.887 --> 00:30:27.887
wasn't conveyed toward Sang Hyeon at all.

00:30:27.987 --> 00:30:29.363
He's confused right now.

00:30:29.387 --> 00:30:31.533
Sang Hyeon seems to be the type
that can't keep his options open,

00:30:31.557 --> 00:30:35.067
but that focuses only
on one person at a time.

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:38.213
So since the two of them
showed their interest in him,

00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:40.673
he probably wanted to
be sure about his feelings,

00:30:40.697 --> 00:30:42.743
which I think is why
he asked that question.

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:44.407
(It seems so.)

00:30:45.537 --> 00:30:48.407
So I'm not sure about how you really feel.

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:54.917
To tell you the truth

00:30:55.847 --> 00:30:57.957
I asked you out on a date

00:30:58.257 --> 00:31:01.963
because I wanted to know
how we feel about each other.

00:31:01.987 --> 00:31:02.964
I understand.

00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:05.428
Because I wanted to find out
more about your honest feelings.

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.737
Also, on our first date,

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:14.197
I was a little nervous.

00:31:14.467 --> 00:31:16.643
- I became much more comfortable...
- You were nervous.

00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:18.937
Around you than before.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:22.923
Even so, I wanted to talk more to you.

00:31:22.947 --> 00:31:24.123
- Really?
- That's the reason.

00:31:24.147 --> 00:31:26.777
With me, what you see is what you get.

00:31:27.077 --> 00:31:29.717
So it won't make any difference.

00:31:29.947 --> 00:31:31.657
(Realizing)

00:31:33.687 --> 00:31:37.897
(Yeong Gyeong chose Sang Hyeon
as a dating partner twice in a row.)

00:31:38.857 --> 00:31:40.173
That's understandable.

00:31:40.197 --> 00:31:41.743
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon
head back to Yeon House after the date.)

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:43.943
There must be someone who
has sent you Love QR messages,

00:31:43.967 --> 00:31:46.597
or someone you've been
sending Love QR messages to.

00:31:47.037 --> 00:31:48.937
That's right. There is.

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:52.177
- But I'm really curious about it.
- Right.

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:57.407
Even when I receive a
message, I don't know who sent it.

00:31:57.777 --> 00:32:00.347
Can you guess who that could be?

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:04.917
- First, Hyeon Jun.
- Hyeon Jun?

00:32:04.987 --> 00:32:08.427
He's been making it clear
that he was interested in me

00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:12.997
since the first day we met.
So I guess it could be him.

00:32:13.927 --> 00:32:17.027
I can't guess the other one.
Could it be Golden Retriever? No?

00:32:17.937 --> 00:32:19.037
- Me?
- Yes.

00:32:19.097 --> 00:32:20.377
- He seems very surprised.
- Me?

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:22.037
Yes. You haven't sent me any?

00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:26.577
I... Well... Actually, I've
never sent you any messages.

00:32:26.937 --> 00:32:28.977
Really? You've never sent me any messages?

00:32:29.177 --> 00:32:31.053
- No.
- Is that true?

00:32:31.077 --> 00:32:32.077
Yes.

00:32:32.777 --> 00:32:34.053
(Realizing)

00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:35.187
Not even once?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.787
No.

00:32:36.817 --> 00:32:39.563
- Really?
- She thought he had sent it to her.

00:32:39.587 --> 00:32:40.893
Oh, boy. I feel bad for her.

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:43.687
Then who is it? I'm shocked.

00:32:44.897 --> 00:32:46.003
She was mistaken.

00:32:46.027 --> 00:32:47.133
(She thought he had sent
her a Love QR message.)

00:32:47.157 --> 00:32:48.267
You're embarrassed, right?

00:32:48.627 --> 00:32:51.297
That's not it. I mean, yes,
I'm a little embarrassed.

00:32:51.897 --> 00:32:54.113
I'm so curious. Here's why.

00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:57.167
There's someone who chose me.

00:32:57.407 --> 00:33:00.383
And I want to talk to him at least once.

00:33:00.407 --> 00:33:02.707
Oh, I see. Is that how
it all happened today?

00:33:03.507 --> 00:33:06.077
You chose me because
you got the wrong idea?

00:33:06.647 --> 00:33:07.717
Yes.

00:33:07.747 --> 00:33:09.263
- Really?
- That's right.

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.723
You should go on another date.

00:33:10.747 --> 00:33:11.857
Are you serious?

00:33:13.517 --> 00:33:15.733
This is why it was unexpected.
I told you I was surprised.

00:33:15.757 --> 00:33:18.727
Oh, that's why you said that.

00:33:19.827 --> 00:33:21.743
That you were surprised by my choice.

00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:23.703
(Yeong Gyeong now knows the
truth. How will her feelings change?)

00:33:23.727 --> 00:33:26.397
Yeong Gyeong must be taken aback

00:33:26.797 --> 00:33:28.683
because she thought it was Sang
Hyeon who sent the message

00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:30.643
- when it was actually Ji Yung.
- That's understandable.

00:33:30.667 --> 00:33:32.953
And that was why she wanted
to talk more to Sang Hyeon,

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.283
and decided to go on a date with him.

00:33:34.307 --> 00:33:35.923
But then she found out
it wasn't Sang Hyeon,

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:37.847
and it was someone else
who sent the message.

00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:42.163
I wonder if it changed her feelings.

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.787
I think her feelings for him have reduced.

00:33:45.017 --> 00:33:46.957
I'm pretty sure she's very disappointed.

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:52.827
(Mu Jin was resting after
the date with Bon Hee.)

00:33:54.767 --> 00:33:56.397
I wonder if Mu Jin feels at ease now.

00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:58.113
- He seems to feel at ease.
- Very much so.

00:33:58.137 --> 00:33:59.497
(Spraying)

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:06.307
(He applies cologne and oral spray.)

00:34:07.947 --> 00:34:10.677
(Checking his appearance)

00:34:13.177 --> 00:34:14.547
Look how light-footed he seems.

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:18.217
(Mu Jin heads to the girls' room.)

00:34:19.587 --> 00:34:22.663
(He runs into So Hyun who
happens to be in the living room.)

00:34:22.687 --> 00:34:23.733
- What's up?
- I came for no reason.

00:34:23.757 --> 00:34:24.927
- For no reason?
- Yes.

00:34:25.157 --> 00:34:26.373
For no reason?

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.573
- For no reason.
- Really?

00:34:27.597 --> 00:34:29.043
- You wanted to rest here?
- Yes.

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.467
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.113
- I really came for no reason.
- You did?

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:34.273
Because you wanted to be alone?

00:34:34.297 --> 00:34:35.977
No, I was wondering where the others were.

00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:37.907
They gathered in that room.

00:34:38.537 --> 00:34:41.153
- I don't want to go in there.
- Okay.

00:34:41.177 --> 00:34:42.923
- You can't go in there?
- No, I mean, the girls...

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:46.047
- Why are you being like this?
- What does it mean?

00:34:46.177 --> 00:34:47.517
I understand.

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:49.917
You can't go in there.

00:34:50.347 --> 00:34:52.463
This is my first time talking to you alone.

00:34:52.487 --> 00:34:53.587
- I know, right?
- Yes.

00:34:56.587 --> 00:34:59.797
(So Hyun's first day at Yeon House)

00:35:00.127 --> 00:35:01.567
(Glancing)

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:06.197
The one I was most curious about
except for Sang Hyeon was Mu Jin.

00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:10.307
Have you talked to the others a lot?

00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:13.507
As for 1-on-1 conversations

00:35:13.907 --> 00:35:16.877
I went on a date with Ji Yung yesterday.

00:35:17.177 --> 00:35:19.247
And today, I went on a date

00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:21.054
with Sang Hyeon.

00:35:21.078 --> 00:35:23.323
But I haven't gotten a chance

00:35:23.347 --> 00:35:26.517
to talk to the other three 1-on-1.

00:35:26.817 --> 00:35:28.177
Right. You got no chance to do so.

00:35:29.157 --> 00:35:31.557
I was curious because
you said you were a model.

00:35:33.427 --> 00:35:36.073
- I was curious about your work.
- You're very interested in fashion.

00:35:36.097 --> 00:35:37.403
Yes, I really love fashion.

00:35:37.427 --> 00:35:38.897
I saw your shoes. They were nice.

00:35:39.297 --> 00:35:42.113
The ones you wore yesterday for the game.

00:35:42.137 --> 00:35:43.114
- Did you see those?
- Yes.

00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:45.313
- "Did you see those?"
- "That model is hard to get."

00:35:45.337 --> 00:35:46.553
I was thinking that while looking at them.

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:49.123
So Hyun shows interest in Mu Jin.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.153
She doesn't seem uninterested in him.

00:35:50.177 --> 00:35:51.677
Do you think that job suits you?

00:35:52.677 --> 00:35:55.363
- My job...
- Do you like your job?

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:56.593
I think I like my job.

00:35:56.617 --> 00:35:57.594
- Really?
- Yes.

00:35:57.618 --> 00:35:59.263
Of course, I get stressed out

00:35:59.287 --> 00:36:01.187
because I want to do well.

00:36:02.287 --> 00:36:03.627
But

00:36:05.357 --> 00:36:07.897
I think I continued my career
because it was enjoyable.

00:36:08.527 --> 00:36:10.043
I'm jealous.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.697
- What do you mean?
- I'm jealous

00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:14.373
that you have a job that you love.

00:36:14.397 --> 00:36:16.683
Considering everything about you, - Yes?

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.337
I find it so cool about you.

00:36:20.277 --> 00:36:22.507
I wanted to get married early.

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:25.023
In order to get married early,

00:36:25.047 --> 00:36:27.647
- I tried to get a stable job.
- I see.

00:36:27.947 --> 00:36:29.717
I started my career earlier than others.

00:36:31.217 --> 00:36:33.357
- And my job...
- Yes?

00:36:34.017 --> 00:36:35.287
It has good work-life balance.

00:36:38.197 --> 00:36:40.927
- I get a lot of personal time...
- I'm jealous of that kind of job.

00:36:41.727 --> 00:36:45.797
So I'm not exactly unhappy with my job.

00:36:47.437 --> 00:36:49.607
But when I see those
who do what they love...

00:36:49.967 --> 00:36:52.477
- You mean, as a job?
- Yes.

00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:53.953
The two of them are very different, indeed.

00:36:53.977 --> 00:36:56.307
I believe you have to be
lucky to get a job you love.

00:36:56.947 --> 00:36:58.617
- I also think I'm lucky.
- Right.

00:37:00.147 --> 00:37:03.093
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about it.

00:37:03.117 --> 00:37:04.863
Being a public servant

00:37:04.887 --> 00:37:07.363
is the exact opposite of
being a fashion model.

00:37:07.387 --> 00:37:09.287
Thank you for sharing this with me.

00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:11.597
I felt very comfortable
while talking to her.

00:37:12.097 --> 00:37:15.097
I saw the down-to-earth
side of her as we talked.

00:37:15.597 --> 00:37:17.097
I found her so cool.

00:37:17.967 --> 00:37:20.437
So I got more curious about her.

00:37:21.937 --> 00:37:23.937
I think I felt that way.

00:37:25.037 --> 00:37:28.177
On the day when So Hyun
moved to Yeon House,

00:37:28.707 --> 00:37:31.477
she said she was curious
about Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.

00:37:31.847 --> 00:37:34.747
And she and Mu Jin
met in the living room

00:37:35.247 --> 00:37:36.323
when no one else was there.

00:37:36.347 --> 00:37:38.093
Right. Both of them like fashion.

00:37:38.117 --> 00:37:40.463
- They share some interests.
- She did her best in a short time.

00:37:40.487 --> 00:37:41.933
- In that darkness.
- Right.

00:37:41.957 --> 00:37:44.957
First, she sat next to
him on that small sofa.

00:37:45.457 --> 00:37:48.743
She also tried hard
to find shared interests.

00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:50.173
- That's right.
- She did everything she could.

00:37:50.197 --> 00:37:51.473
She did everything she could.

00:37:51.497 --> 00:37:53.143
You know, it's quite common,

00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:56.843
for two people with opposite careers
to meet and make a cute couple.

00:37:56.867 --> 00:37:58.253
Such couples are really...

00:37:58.277 --> 00:37:59.453
- There's nothing...
- There's a song about it.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.653
"The Reason Why Opposites Attract."

00:38:00.677 --> 00:38:03.177
Exactly. It happens.

00:38:04.977 --> 00:38:08.387
(Bon Hee is fixing her
hair alone in her room.)

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:12.757
(Coming in quietly)

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:15.477
I can't get out of the room
because they are talking.

00:38:16.087 --> 00:38:17.233
I left them alone too.

00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:19.727
We can have a chat. I was bored.

00:38:20.557 --> 00:38:23.067
Oh, no. She knows they're
talking out in the living room?

00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:26.337
Do you mind me fixing
my hair while talking to you?

00:38:27.567 --> 00:38:28.637
(Nodding)

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:30.837
The thing is...

00:38:31.437 --> 00:38:32.483
What... Go ahead.

00:38:32.507 --> 00:38:35.023
I don't remember how to date a man.

00:38:35.047 --> 00:38:36.653
- Hold on a second.
- That's sad.

00:38:36.677 --> 00:38:39.747
You can go on. The
topic sounded so profound.

00:38:39.877 --> 00:38:41.377
(Sighing)

00:38:42.087 --> 00:38:43.687
- Are you talking about Sang Won?
- Yes.

00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:47.387
Why? Earlier... What's
going on between you two?

00:38:48.087 --> 00:38:49.127
It's just...

00:38:51.087 --> 00:38:54.397
(After the date with Sang
Won, Ji Won became worried.)

00:38:55.067 --> 00:38:57.697
I think I should get to know him better,

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:01.707
and then make up my
mind, but it's difficult.

00:39:02.737 --> 00:39:04.443
I don't know what to talk about with him.

00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:05.747
What about talking about outfit?

00:39:07.337 --> 00:39:09.747
- I'm good with words when relaxed.
- Exactly.

00:39:10.547 --> 00:39:12.693
- I definitely know that.
- But when I'm with someone I like,

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:13.993
I can't talk.

00:39:14.017 --> 00:39:15.363
- That's a given. I also...
- I feel so nervous.

00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.987
- We...
- My heart races...

00:39:17.447 --> 00:39:18.567
You know what I mean, right?

00:39:19.217 --> 00:39:21.417
I just can't talk. I've become a fool.

00:39:21.587 --> 00:39:24.087
But that's also who you are.

00:39:24.627 --> 00:39:26.533
I surprised myself when I got
so nervous after a long time.

00:39:26.557 --> 00:39:27.673
- Really?
- Yes.

00:39:27.697 --> 00:39:30.327
It's because Mu Jin and I

00:39:30.627 --> 00:39:32.943
I felt something today
that I hadn't felt before.

00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:35.807
- What is it?
- We had to speak casually.

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:39.113
Mu Jin jokingly addressed me
as an older woman a few times,

00:39:39.137 --> 00:39:41.107
and I got a reality check.

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:43.907
- Because of what he called you?
- Yes.

00:39:43.977 --> 00:39:46.417
I mean, I have a brother who's
11 years younger than me.

00:39:46.977 --> 00:39:49.187
If Mu Jin is 11 or 12
years younger than me,

00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:52.387
I wonder if I'd be okay with it.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:55.127
I thought about it even
when I was on a date.

00:39:57.087 --> 00:39:58.903
We're old enough to know

00:39:58.927 --> 00:40:00.857
that marriage is more than

00:40:01.127 --> 00:40:03.797
just a union of two people in love.

00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:06.997
I consider marriage
whenever I date someone.

00:40:07.367 --> 00:40:09.743
I'm the type that wouldn't
even start dating

00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:12.277
if the relationship has
no marriage potential.

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.907
That worries me now.

00:40:15.607 --> 00:40:17.047
I won't let him know though.

00:40:18.777 --> 00:40:20.853
Bon Hee seems to have
decided to join the show

00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.723
- to find someone to marry.
- Right.

00:40:22.747 --> 00:40:24.293
(While enjoying the date, both
of them were contemplating.)

00:40:24.317 --> 00:40:27.387
If you meet someone
without knowing his age,

00:40:27.457 --> 00:40:29.333
and he turns out to be
around the same age

00:40:29.357 --> 00:40:31.927
as your brother who's 11
years younger than you,

00:40:32.227 --> 00:40:33.627
how would you feel?

00:40:33.727 --> 00:40:35.373
Would that change your heart?

00:40:35.397 --> 00:40:37.703
- No way.
- It wouldn't change your heart?

00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:38.737
I'd be grateful.

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:42.837
I was kidding. An 11-year age difference

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:45.813
could weigh on my mind a little bit.

00:40:45.837 --> 00:40:46.837
It could?

00:40:47.137 --> 00:40:51.523
Yes. Because from my perspective,

00:40:51.547 --> 00:40:52.853
a man who's 11 years younger than me

00:40:52.877 --> 00:40:54.153
would feel like my own child,

00:40:54.177 --> 00:40:55.793
- or my youngest brother.
- My point exactly.

00:40:55.817 --> 00:40:58.123
Imagine that a man you like
is your little brother's friend.

00:40:58.147 --> 00:41:00.157
That would change your
perception of that man.

00:41:00.487 --> 00:41:03.233
- It'd feel strange all of a sudden.
- Right.

00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:04.933
- It would worry me, indeed.
- It must be hard for Bon Hee...

00:41:04.957 --> 00:41:07.033
- If he's around my brother's age...
- I think I'd become a bit timid.

00:41:07.057 --> 00:41:08.673
I wonder how things will go between them.

00:41:08.697 --> 00:41:09.697
(That's possible.)

00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:13.373
Come here. Let's sit
over there for a while.

00:41:13.397 --> 00:41:14.397
The weather is nice.

00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:18.713
(Sighing)

00:41:18.737 --> 00:41:19.977
I have so much on my mind.

00:41:21.207 --> 00:41:22.207
Why?

00:41:23.407 --> 00:41:25.117
I'll be honest with you, Hyeon Jun.

00:41:25.747 --> 00:41:26.817
To be honest,

00:41:28.447 --> 00:41:33.357
I think today's date was perfect for me.

00:41:34.257 --> 00:41:36.703
It's because I got a chance
to compare those two.

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:37.733
That's true.

00:41:37.757 --> 00:41:39.557
- Right.
- So who is it?

00:41:39.727 --> 00:41:41.197
Here's what I realized after that.

00:41:42.127 --> 00:41:44.927
I was more comfortable
speaking casually to Ye Eun.

00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:47.797
But the one whom I hit it off well with

00:41:48.407 --> 00:41:49.384
was Ji Won, clearly.

00:41:49.408 --> 00:41:51.088
I felt more energetic when I was with her.

00:41:52.837 --> 00:41:54.353
(Sighing)

00:41:54.377 --> 00:41:58.647
But I feel a little bad about it.

00:42:01.077 --> 00:42:02.747
You can just follow your heart.

00:42:04.187 --> 00:42:05.833
(Sang Won still has a lot on his mind.)

00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:08.657
It seems that he's still unsure
about his feelings for them.

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:11.263
(Right then, the last
couple comes back home.)

00:42:11.287 --> 00:42:15.497
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang Hyeon)

00:42:15.797 --> 00:42:16.797
It's like...

00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:19.267
(Surprised)

00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:20.397
You're late.

00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:22.007
We're very late.

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.037
We went far away from here.

00:42:25.207 --> 00:42:27.483
My gosh. She goes in
without even looking at him.

00:42:27.507 --> 00:42:29.023
They're going inside the house.

00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:30.283
Let's change into
comfortable clothes first.

00:42:30.307 --> 00:42:31.477
Okay. Sounds good.

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:35.387
I feel so sorry for Hyeon Jun.

00:42:42.387 --> 00:42:43.363
(Knocking on the door)

00:42:43.387 --> 00:42:44.387
Come in.

00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:48.073
- Come on in.
- I'm here to chat.

00:42:48.097 --> 00:42:49.577
- I'm glad you're here.
- Come on in.

00:42:50.227 --> 00:42:52.113
They all gathered.

00:42:52.137 --> 00:42:53.673
- I'll apply some too.
- This is from Tamburins.

00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:55.143
- Where did you go?
- Can I sit here?

00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.607
- I went to Korea University...
- It's a really good product.

00:42:57.767 --> 00:42:59.877
Where I did my bachelor's degree.

00:43:00.677 --> 00:43:02.547
This is only the beginning.

00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:05.323
- You seem happy.
- Indeed.

00:43:05.347 --> 00:43:08.587
That's not the case. I'm shocked, actually.

00:43:08.917 --> 00:43:09.947
- Why?
- Really?

00:43:10.517 --> 00:43:11.617
So here's what happened.

00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:14.463
- It's interesting.
- What happened?

00:43:14.487 --> 00:43:17.163
I thought he was the one who chose me.

00:43:17.187 --> 00:43:20.503
That's why I picked him
as my dating partner,

00:43:20.527 --> 00:43:22.097
so that I could talk more to him.

00:43:22.497 --> 00:43:24.473
I was sure that it was him who chose me,

00:43:24.497 --> 00:43:25.777
but it turned out it wasn't him.

00:43:26.297 --> 00:43:28.043
It turned out that way.

00:43:28.067 --> 00:43:29.613
So I was confused.

00:43:29.637 --> 00:43:32.677
I wanted to talk more to him

00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:34.907
because I thought he was interested in me.

00:43:35.507 --> 00:43:36.947
But it wasn't the case.

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.123
Oh, really?

00:43:38.147 --> 00:43:39.753
- So I... Sorry?
- Why didn't you know?

00:43:39.777 --> 00:43:41.593
- Why didn't you know?
- One of the two men

00:43:41.617 --> 00:43:44.093
shows interest in me so clearly.

00:43:44.117 --> 00:43:45.863
Some guys send mixed signals.

00:43:45.887 --> 00:43:48.263
There was this guy who
sent me mixed signals,

00:43:48.287 --> 00:43:50.257
and I got the wrong idea.

00:43:50.887 --> 00:43:52.533
- You're so cute.
- I totally misunderstood him.

00:43:52.557 --> 00:43:53.534
Goodness, you.

00:43:53.558 --> 00:43:56.273
- Yeong Gyeong, you're so cute.
- Indeed.

00:43:56.297 --> 00:43:57.627
I'm embarrassed.

00:43:58.027 --> 00:44:00.067
Let's gather around and
have a chat among the guys.

00:44:00.097 --> 00:44:01.437
We really should do that.

00:44:03.367 --> 00:44:05.777
Sang Hyeon, you were the biggest variable.

00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:07.357
Exactly. I didn't expect that either.

00:44:07.837 --> 00:44:10.047
I couldn't even imagine

00:44:10.407 --> 00:44:12.423
that someone like So Hyun
would think highly of me.

00:44:12.447 --> 00:44:13.853
- No way.
- Really?

00:44:13.877 --> 00:44:15.017
This is how I feel.

00:44:15.417 --> 00:44:17.787
So Hyun said she liked a
man like whole chicken soup

00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:19.317
when we were talking about it.

00:44:20.017 --> 00:44:22.633
(Whole chicken soup: A man
who's stable yet less proactive)

00:44:22.657 --> 00:44:26.557
(Buldak: A man who's
unstable yet very proactive)

00:44:27.057 --> 00:44:29.417
(So Hyun said she preferred a
man like whole chicken soup.)

00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:30.997
And in my opinion,

00:44:31.497 --> 00:44:34.867
the person who fits the
description the most

00:44:35.337 --> 00:44:37.007
- is you.
- Actually, I was thinking,

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.277
"Could it be me?" I was
thinking that while eating.

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:41.413
No matter how much I
think about it... You know it.

00:44:41.437 --> 00:44:44.883
She said that she wasn't interested
in me because of my appearance,

00:44:44.907 --> 00:44:46.453
but she liked me after talking to me.

00:44:46.477 --> 00:44:47.553
That's what I just thought.

00:44:47.577 --> 00:44:51.087
She wouldn't care so much
about a man's appearance.

00:44:51.617 --> 00:44:54.393
I mean, she's a model, so she
probably sees so many handsome men.

00:44:54.417 --> 00:44:55.763
That's right. I totally agree.

00:44:55.787 --> 00:44:57.227
- Right.
- I thought a lot about it.

00:44:57.287 --> 00:44:58.327
I feel daunted.

00:44:58.797 --> 00:45:00.317
It's natural for you to feel that way.

00:45:00.757 --> 00:45:03.427
There's no reason for you to feel daunted

00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:06.297
because she sees male
models in a professional context.

00:45:07.067 --> 00:45:09.567
You have a different career.

00:45:11.007 --> 00:45:12.777
(Sighing)

00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:14.483
Why is he so confused?

00:45:14.507 --> 00:45:16.823
(After the date with So Hyun,
his mind became complicated.)

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.567
I like her because she's different from me.

00:45:19.077 --> 00:45:21.077
But the difference between us

00:45:21.547 --> 00:45:23.993
kind of makes me feel

00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:26.987
that there's a wall between us.

00:45:28.757 --> 00:45:30.363
I'm not sure if it's okay to say this,

00:45:30.387 --> 00:45:34.357
but I think of her as a celebrity.

00:45:35.297 --> 00:45:36.903
Her life has been different from mine.

00:45:36.927 --> 00:45:41.197
And I'm old-fashioned and stubborn.

00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:46.753
(Right then, Ji Yung joins them.)

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:48.437
That's exactly what I was talking about.

00:45:50.877 --> 00:45:52.523
When we go on a date,

00:45:52.547 --> 00:45:54.353
- we don't get enough time...
- What a shame.

00:45:54.377 --> 00:45:56.363
I was so sad it was over.

00:45:56.387 --> 00:45:58.093
(Ji Yung was curious about the date
between So Hyun and Sang Hyeon.)

00:45:58.117 --> 00:46:00.263
Here's what we were just talking about.

00:46:00.287 --> 00:46:02.203
When I was on a date
with So Hyun, I realized

00:46:02.227 --> 00:46:04.887
that the more I get to know her,

00:46:06.257 --> 00:46:08.457
the thicker the wall between us gets.

00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:11.397
I feel like I'm not good enough for her.

00:46:11.497 --> 00:46:14.573
Of course, I know you wouldn't
care about things like that.

00:46:14.597 --> 00:46:18.107
But I care when I can see it.

00:46:18.837 --> 00:46:20.553
Also, the more I talk to her,

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:22.847
the more of small
differences I find between us.

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:26.923
But fortunately, we went
to an amusement park.

00:46:26.947 --> 00:46:31.217
If we went to a cafe or
somewhere we could talk a lot,

00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:33.563
things would rather have
gone bad between us.

00:46:33.587 --> 00:46:35.663
I think that because
realizing those differences

00:46:35.687 --> 00:46:37.787
would deepen the relationship.

00:46:38.327 --> 00:46:39.973
That's why I really enjoyed the date.

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.603
The date at the amusement
park made me so happy.

00:46:41.627 --> 00:46:44.127
We could just enjoy ourselves
and laugh, showing each other

00:46:45.297 --> 00:46:46.973
only the positive sides of ourselves.

00:46:46.997 --> 00:46:50.037
But the date ended so early.

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:53.177
I didn't have enough time to try anything.

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.447
I was so sad about that.

00:46:55.547 --> 00:46:59.317
I thought I had the chance
to break the wall between us.

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:04.587
(Ji Yung was listening to Sang
Hyeon without saying anything.)

00:47:05.087 --> 00:47:06.293
(Smiling)

00:47:06.317 --> 00:47:09.563
- About So Hyun...
- Yes, tell us.

00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:12.857
I think I've figure out
what kind of person she is.

00:47:13.827 --> 00:47:16.367
So Hyun and I are the same type.

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:19.297
(She cracks up.)

00:47:21.937 --> 00:47:22.937
Oh, no.

00:47:23.167 --> 00:47:26.007
Ji Yung totally got the wrong idea.

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:29.307
So Hyun and I are the same type.

00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:32.453
She's been living in a
similar environment to me.

00:47:32.477 --> 00:47:34.853
Fashion models and athletes
live similar lives in some ways.

00:47:34.877 --> 00:47:38.147
We share similar life experiences.

00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:40.387
She and I have so much in common

00:47:40.487 --> 00:47:41.657
that it gives me goosebumps.

00:47:41.757 --> 00:47:44.357
That's true. But he's
wrong about everything else.

00:47:46.057 --> 00:47:49.627
The similarities between you
and her make you attracted to her.

00:47:49.727 --> 00:47:50.843
(Nodding)

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.697
The similarities made me attracted to her.

00:47:56.137 --> 00:47:58.013
It's true that Sang Hyeon
is the opposite of her.

00:47:58.037 --> 00:47:59.083
Oh, boy.

00:47:59.107 --> 00:48:00.787
He says Sang Hyeon is the opposite of her.

00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:03.723
This is so hilarious.

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:06.553
(The two men, who are opposites,
are both interested in So Hyun.)

00:48:06.577 --> 00:48:07.877
Oh, my goodness.

00:48:08.277 --> 00:48:10.797
- This is driving me crazy.
- I'm glad Ji Yung joined the show.

00:48:11.387 --> 00:48:13.147
- I feel bad for Ji Yung.
- I'm glad he did.

00:48:13.987 --> 00:48:15.803
- It was a really good idea.
- Oh, gosh.

00:48:15.827 --> 00:48:17.963
This is a chance for
him to see his true self.

00:48:17.987 --> 00:48:19.403
(He's hilarious.)

00:48:19.427 --> 00:48:20.573
How else could he do so?

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:23.943
I mean, I find Ji Yung innocent and cute.

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:27.073
He looks like a younger
man who's deeply in love.

00:48:27.097 --> 00:48:29.713
- And I like that about him.
- That's true. I agree.

00:48:29.737 --> 00:48:34.313
But the fact that he completely
failed to read So Hyun

00:48:34.337 --> 00:48:37.607
when he went on a date
with her dumbfounded me.

00:48:38.547 --> 00:48:40.027
(So Hyun and Ji Yung's glamping date)

00:48:40.577 --> 00:48:44.163
(Ji Yung was so happy that
he felt like it was his birthday.)

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:45.363
(Calm)

00:48:45.387 --> 00:48:47.257
(It even felt like your birthday?)

00:48:47.887 --> 00:48:50.187
(Do you like a muscular man?)

00:48:50.387 --> 00:48:54.357
(I prefer a man with lean muscles.)

00:48:54.827 --> 00:48:58.097
He felt like a little brother
who was similar to me.

00:48:59.337 --> 00:49:00.667
I rather think

00:49:02.397 --> 00:49:04.843
that Ji Yung is a simple man.

00:49:04.867 --> 00:49:07.313
- He's innocent.
- Yes. He's pure-hearted.

00:49:07.337 --> 00:49:09.283
- That's right.
- He doesn't calculate.

00:49:09.307 --> 00:49:11.627
He's not complicated. He
was like, "I've figured her out."

00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:13.653
"So Hyun and I are the same type."

00:49:13.677 --> 00:49:14.853
(He simply follows his instincts.)

00:49:14.877 --> 00:49:16.717
He's so cute.

00:49:16.947 --> 00:49:18.823
While watching Sang Hyeon,
Sang Won, and Ji Yung,

00:49:18.847 --> 00:49:20.587
I felt like I was watching a sitcom.

00:49:21.657 --> 00:49:22.963
The three of them...

00:49:22.987 --> 00:49:24.033
- What's funny is...
- They're so funny.

00:49:24.057 --> 00:49:25.333
That they're talking without
listening to one another.

00:49:25.357 --> 00:49:26.373
It's so funny.

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:27.803
They have no intention
of listening to one another.

00:49:27.827 --> 00:49:29.473
They're not having a conversation.

00:49:29.497 --> 00:49:31.043
- They're doing a monologue.
- They're so cute.

00:49:31.067 --> 00:49:32.497
"Here's what I think."

00:49:32.867 --> 00:49:34.073
"I thought about it, and..."

00:49:34.097 --> 00:49:35.837
- "We're the same type."
- Exactly.

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:39.153
(The three girls are still talking.)

00:49:39.177 --> 00:49:41.713
I looked around the
school after a long time.

00:49:41.737 --> 00:49:44.077
We even looked around the schoolyard too.

00:49:44.647 --> 00:49:47.877
Also, right near the dance studio,

00:49:48.077 --> 00:49:49.547
there's a restaurant.

00:49:50.217 --> 00:49:52.417
We ate there.

00:49:53.017 --> 00:49:55.457
Sang Won and I kept saying, "It's so good."

00:49:55.957 --> 00:49:57.157
"It's really tasty."

00:49:57.257 --> 00:49:59.497
We kept saying that while eating.

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:01.027
That's nice.

00:50:02.027 --> 00:50:03.267
- It must've been fun.
- Yes.

00:50:04.197 --> 00:50:05.913
- Ji Won, where did you go?
- At that hour

00:50:05.937 --> 00:50:08.167
Seoul Tower. It was so nice.

00:50:11.867 --> 00:50:14.913
Oh, right. Did you guys
hang a padlock or not?

00:50:14.937 --> 00:50:16.137
- Oh, my.
- She's checking it.

00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:17.747
- We didn't.
- Why not?

00:50:18.277 --> 00:50:20.577
- We didn't do that.
- Doesn't everyone do that?

00:50:21.647 --> 00:50:23.647
Seoul Tower is all about the love lock.

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:25.023
We didn't do it.

00:50:25.047 --> 00:50:26.517
(She's sorry.)

00:50:26.617 --> 00:50:30.033
We wrote on the wall there.

00:50:30.057 --> 00:50:31.887
The wall is filled with writings.

00:50:34.057 --> 00:50:35.627
Sang Won and I wrote on it.

00:50:35.797 --> 00:50:36.827
Did you really?

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:39.073
- At the restaurant?
- "We will be back."

00:50:39.097 --> 00:50:43.267
(We will be back.)

00:50:45.037 --> 00:50:46.014
That's nice.

00:50:46.038 --> 00:50:47.213
(Envious, uncomfortable)

00:50:47.237 --> 00:50:48.437
That must've been fun.

00:50:48.977 --> 00:50:50.307
We made memories.

00:50:50.877 --> 00:50:52.483
Sang Won drove his car.

00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:53.577
- Right.
- Right.

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:56.663
She's getting awkward.
She can't control it.

00:50:56.687 --> 00:50:59.387
I can see that Ji Won is
forcing herself to smile.

00:51:00.287 --> 00:51:01.757
It was fun.

00:51:02.457 --> 00:51:04.387
I got to hear Sang Won's story.

00:51:06.097 --> 00:51:08.703
- Bon Hee is conscious of them.
- Oh, dear.

00:51:08.727 --> 00:51:10.997
She knows what's going on.

00:51:12.197 --> 00:51:15.213
Did you not talk to Sang Won?

00:51:15.237 --> 00:51:16.607
How he

00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:19.337
studied?

00:51:19.477 --> 00:51:20.613
How Sang Won studied?

00:51:20.637 --> 00:51:24.447
He seems to have lived
a proper, textbook life.

00:51:24.577 --> 00:51:26.523
When I heard him talk,

00:51:26.547 --> 00:51:28.447
I realized he was a very smart person.

00:51:29.117 --> 00:51:31.263
- He's smart.
- He told her about his family too.

00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:33.717
Right. They had a deep conversation.

00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:37.627
I didn't ask him for the details,

00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:40.003
but when I heard his answer to a question,

00:51:40.027 --> 00:51:44.627
I could see how he's lived his life.

00:51:46.037 --> 00:51:48.697
(Smiling)

00:51:49.767 --> 00:51:51.113
(Smilnig back)

00:51:51.137 --> 00:51:53.753
It's the vibe we've never seen before.

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:56.083
(The two older women who
went on a date with Sang Won...)

00:51:56.107 --> 00:51:57.507
(have a tense standoff.)

00:51:58.577 --> 00:52:00.097
They should turn off the boiler there.

00:52:00.247 --> 00:52:02.053
- Right. They should.
- It's heated up.

00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:04.193
That was scary.

00:52:04.217 --> 00:52:06.193
- Yes. It was tense.
- These two are...

00:52:06.217 --> 00:52:07.777
(The atmosphere was tense in the room.)

00:52:08.217 --> 00:52:11.127
(Meanwhile, Yeong Gyeong
asked Hyeon Jun to talk.)

00:52:11.357 --> 00:52:13.703
- There's nobody here.
- They are going to talk more.

00:52:13.727 --> 00:52:16.827
There might be bugs outside.

00:52:17.497 --> 00:52:18.767
Then let's talk here.

00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:21.467
There might be bugs, right?

00:52:22.907 --> 00:52:24.607
Oh, dear. Look at those heavy footsteps.

00:52:27.007 --> 00:52:28.037
What is it?

00:52:28.177 --> 00:52:30.183
I've just come to talk.

00:52:30.207 --> 00:52:34.147
- Right.
- To talk about my honest feelings.

00:52:35.477 --> 00:52:36.793
Did you enjoy the date?

00:52:36.817 --> 00:52:37.823
(Laughing)

00:52:37.847 --> 00:52:39.493
I am asking because I'm curious.

00:52:39.517 --> 00:52:40.857
It's just that...

00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:43.803
You look uncomfortable.

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.487
- Me?
- Yes.

00:52:45.957 --> 00:52:46.997
I am not.

00:52:47.457 --> 00:52:49.127
- You're not?
- I'm not uncomfortable.

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:51.473
I was just sorry

00:52:51.497 --> 00:52:53.643
that we didn't get to go on a date.

00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:56.513
I thought it was a shame.

00:52:56.537 --> 00:52:58.737
- And...
- Right.

00:52:59.707 --> 00:53:01.937
I heard you had no idea.

00:53:02.437 --> 00:53:04.623
- Had no idea?
- You had no idea

00:53:04.647 --> 00:53:07.547
that I was expressing my
interest by doing things for you.

00:53:09.017 --> 00:53:10.293
I knew, but I didn't know.

00:53:10.317 --> 00:53:11.687
It's like this. I was eating it,

00:53:12.617 --> 00:53:15.887
but others were eating it too.

00:53:18.827 --> 00:53:21.457
- Because it wasn't just for you.
- Right.

00:53:21.797 --> 00:53:23.827
But if you think about it,

00:53:24.567 --> 00:53:27.837
everything I've done was for you.

00:53:28.537 --> 00:53:29.643
- Really?
- Yes.

00:53:29.667 --> 00:53:31.583
(Yeong Gyeong pretends
she didn't know his feelings.)

00:53:31.607 --> 00:53:32.983
I'm the type of person

00:53:33.007 --> 00:53:36.477
who struggles to express it with words.

00:53:37.207 --> 00:53:38.947
This was my way of expressing.

00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:40.993
They are very similar.

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.823
He approached her in a
way that is not too aggressive.

00:53:42.847 --> 00:53:44.887
They both express their
feelings in their own ways.

00:53:46.857 --> 00:53:48.133
That felt good.

00:53:48.157 --> 00:53:51.133
(As soon as their conversation
ends, Sang Won comes in.)

00:53:51.157 --> 00:53:52.157
(Stopping)

00:53:52.427 --> 00:53:53.873
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.673
- No, you can.
- No, you can.

00:53:55.697 --> 00:53:56.897
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.473
That was it.

00:53:58.497 --> 00:54:00.797
- You wanted us to stop you.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:54:02.037 --> 00:54:03.437
It looked fun.

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.313
Why is he sitting there?

00:54:05.337 --> 00:54:06.897
You're here to have fun by watching us.

00:54:07.737 --> 00:54:09.177
How was today?

00:54:10.077 --> 00:54:13.193
It was a good day. I
got to make up my mind.

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.347
- Again?
- I was very unsure before today.

00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:17.647
What's wrong with him?

00:54:18.387 --> 00:54:20.363
- He's unbelievable.
- Two ladies

00:54:20.387 --> 00:54:22.857
are struggling in the room because of him.

00:54:23.957 --> 00:54:25.587
(Looking)

00:54:27.027 --> 00:54:28.633
(Does he have some
secret he wants to share?)

00:54:28.657 --> 00:54:29.767
He's locking the door.

00:54:30.067 --> 00:54:31.973
(Locking the door)

00:54:31.997 --> 00:54:33.067
Look at him.

00:54:35.897 --> 00:54:37.383
(He's excited, isn't he?)

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.913
(Sang Won locks Ji Won's
room to tighten the security.)

00:54:38.937 --> 00:54:40.277
That's hilarious.

00:54:41.007 --> 00:54:42.277
Have you heard...

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:44.923
- She has not...
- What is it?

00:54:44.947 --> 00:54:46.853
Talked to the ladies.

00:54:46.877 --> 00:54:48.217
She doesn't know anything.

00:54:49.147 --> 00:54:50.817
(What is it?)

00:54:52.487 --> 00:54:54.663
I didn't get any votes at first,

00:54:54.687 --> 00:54:58.757
but I suddenly got two, so I'm grateful.

00:54:59.427 --> 00:55:01.297
Today, there was

00:55:02.427 --> 00:55:03.897
someone I had in mind,

00:55:04.627 --> 00:55:06.427
and there was someone
I talked to previously.

00:55:06.467 --> 00:55:08.743
I got to go on a date with them both.

00:55:08.767 --> 00:55:10.137
(It was Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

00:55:10.337 --> 00:55:11.807
I had been very confused,

00:55:13.177 --> 00:55:15.383
but now I know who I'm more drawn to.

00:55:15.407 --> 00:55:16.653
- Right.
- So who is it?

00:55:16.677 --> 00:55:17.677
(Right.)

00:55:18.007 --> 00:55:20.953
I was able to become more certain

00:55:20.977 --> 00:55:23.317
about my choice.

00:55:24.047 --> 00:55:25.323
You still have no idea who
I am talking about, do you?

00:55:25.347 --> 00:55:26.787
- You don't, do you?
- I don't know.

00:55:27.317 --> 00:55:28.717
- I don't.
- I will never tell you.

00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.463
- He's excited.
- Even if you say more,

00:55:30.487 --> 00:55:32.757
I still won't know anyway.

00:55:33.127 --> 00:55:34.897
I can tell you. Who cares?

00:55:35.427 --> 00:55:36.797
Then tell me.

00:55:37.697 --> 00:55:40.137
- He's going to tell her.
- I will keep your secret.

00:55:42.367 --> 00:55:43.443
(Ye Eun comes in, and
they instantly become quiet.)

00:55:43.467 --> 00:55:44.843
That was so close.

00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:46.807
I know. What a timing.

00:55:46.907 --> 00:55:48.837
(Frozen)

00:55:50.377 --> 00:55:52.347
(Sighing)

00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:54.747
(Now tell me.)

00:55:54.947 --> 00:55:57.787
Their energies are similar, you know.

00:55:58.047 --> 00:55:59.757
They are quite similar.

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:03.233
- That's why it's hard.
- Right.

00:56:03.257 --> 00:56:04.587
(You are puzzled.)

00:56:05.227 --> 00:56:08.527
(Ye Eun comes out of the room again.)

00:56:09.227 --> 00:56:11.667
Even if our conversation gets
stuck, it doesn't feel awkward.

00:56:14.697 --> 00:56:16.237
- Ye Eun is coming.
- Quiet.

00:56:18.767 --> 00:56:19.977
(Opening)

00:56:20.307 --> 00:56:21.313
(Stopping)

00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:22.513
This pistachio is good.

00:56:22.537 --> 00:56:23.677
(Stopping)

00:56:23.977 --> 00:56:26.347
- He's unbelievable.
- This pistachio is good.

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.377
Hello.

00:56:28.947 --> 00:56:30.087
Hello.

00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:33.457
What are you doing here?

00:56:33.657 --> 00:56:35.087
- We are just...
- Talking?

00:56:36.487 --> 00:56:37.957
Cheering.

00:56:39.027 --> 00:56:40.927
- You can come.
- We were cheering for him.

00:56:41.657 --> 00:56:42.697
Thank you.

00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:44.803
(Ye Eun goes to Sang Won...)

00:56:44.827 --> 00:56:45.943
Wait.

00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:47.113
(and sits next to him.)

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.573
It doesn't look easy.

00:56:48.597 --> 00:56:51.437
(Ye Eun goes to Sang
Won and sits next to him.)

00:56:53.107 --> 00:56:55.737
(Awkward)

00:56:56.107 --> 00:56:58.707
(They are quiet.)

00:56:59.477 --> 00:57:00.747
This pistachio is good.

00:57:01.577 --> 00:57:02.647
Is it good?

00:57:03.247 --> 00:57:04.363
It's sweet.

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:07.217
(It gets awkward, and
they just eat pistachio.)

00:57:07.817 --> 00:57:09.017
I have a question for you.

00:57:09.887 --> 00:57:11.227
Why did you not know about it?

00:57:12.487 --> 00:57:14.657
- You mean everything?
- I mean everything.

00:57:15.857 --> 00:57:18.327
I thought you weren't
talking to each other.

00:57:18.597 --> 00:57:20.573
But at some point, I realized

00:57:20.597 --> 00:57:22.497
- I was wrong.
- Everything had changed.

00:57:23.337 --> 00:57:25.167
I started it.

00:57:25.637 --> 00:57:29.107
I was the first one to
ask in front of people.

00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:30.917
- You asked to have a conversation?
- Yes.

00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:34.953
I was the first one to go and ask to talk.

00:57:34.977 --> 00:57:36.487
I started that trend.

00:57:36.747 --> 00:57:38.823
Nobody else did it before I did.

00:57:38.847 --> 00:57:42.057
(Nobody else did it before I did.)

00:57:42.357 --> 00:57:46.027
Yesterday, Bon Hee and
Mu Jin were talking outside.

00:57:46.527 --> 00:57:48.173
And it was really fun for me.

00:57:48.197 --> 00:57:50.203
- Because it was my 1st time.
- It was your 1st time.

00:57:50.227 --> 00:57:53.237
Hyeon Jun doesn't
enjoy being in a big group.

00:57:53.567 --> 00:57:55.273
- Right.
- It's hard to talk to everyone.

00:57:55.297 --> 00:57:56.283
Right.

00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:58.143
It's fun when it's a small group of 3 or 4.

00:57:58.167 --> 00:57:59.467
How about you, Sang Won?

00:58:00.007 --> 00:58:01.607
- It's fun...
- How about you, Sang Won?

00:58:05.147 --> 00:58:06.823
Do you like it when you're in a big group?

00:58:06.847 --> 00:58:07.993
A big group is good,

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.857
and a smaller group
is good too. But I just

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.523
- I just...
- Oh, dear.

00:58:12.547 --> 00:58:14.687
- "I just..."
- He's stuck.

00:58:15.417 --> 00:58:17.257
Do you not like talking
to someone in private?

00:58:18.357 --> 00:58:20.077
That's not what I meant. It's just that...

00:58:21.697 --> 00:58:23.367
You might have a different preference.

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:28.213
Right. It depends on the
circumstances and timing.

00:58:28.237 --> 00:58:29.214
Right.

00:58:29.238 --> 00:58:33.007
You're the type who gets
conscious about what's going on.

00:58:33.537 --> 00:58:34.683
I just...

00:58:34.707 --> 00:58:36.423
(Ye Eun wants him to approach her, )

00:58:36.447 --> 00:58:37.453
I...

00:58:37.477 --> 00:58:39.777
(and Sang Won hesitates.)

00:58:42.977 --> 00:58:44.647
I am very frustrated.

00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:47.057
But nothing is going to change

00:58:47.587 --> 00:58:50.557
by pressuring him.

00:58:52.827 --> 00:58:53.833
I'm frustrated.

00:58:53.857 --> 00:58:55.377
(All she can do is wait for Sang Won.)

00:58:55.497 --> 00:58:56.773
I am very frustrated.

00:58:56.797 --> 00:59:01.537
(Feeling frustrated, Ye Eun leaves.)

00:59:03.267 --> 00:59:05.867
I think Sang Won hates
being in a serious situation.

00:59:06.407 --> 00:59:09.037
There are men who hates it by nature.

00:59:09.407 --> 00:59:11.883
There are people who feel very awkward,

00:59:11.907 --> 00:59:13.847
and embarrassed in a serious situation.

00:59:14.147 --> 00:59:15.517
They are drifting apart.

00:59:18.447 --> 00:59:20.487
Continue where you left off.

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:23.227
I was flustered actually.

00:59:23.357 --> 00:59:24.334
Right.

00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:26.433
(Curious)

00:59:26.457 --> 00:59:29.797
I was chosen by Ye Eun and Ji Won.

00:59:30.727 --> 00:59:31.867
Ye Eun

00:59:33.797 --> 00:59:36.197
spoke with more clarity.

00:59:36.607 --> 00:59:39.037
So I need to speak with
the same level of clarity.

00:59:39.467 --> 00:59:42.177
She was pestering me to talk just now.

00:59:42.837 --> 00:59:45.377
She was asking if I didn't
want to talk to her in private.

00:59:45.407 --> 00:59:47.393
It's because I am not
approaching her aggressively.

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.847
Right.

00:59:49.947 --> 00:59:50.947
It's like,

00:59:52.147 --> 00:59:54.293
"Everyone else is doing
it. Why aren't you doing it?"

00:59:54.317 --> 00:59:55.733
But I can't do that easily.

00:59:55.757 --> 00:59:58.357
- He feels pressured.
- Some time has passed,

00:59:59.457 --> 01:00:01.697
and I think Ji Won and I are a good match.

01:00:01.957 --> 01:00:05.473
I have a hard time sharing
my feelings to Ye Eun honestly.

01:00:05.497 --> 01:00:07.073
- Right.
- I'm careful.

01:00:07.097 --> 01:00:09.243
Ye Eun expressed her feelings to me,

01:00:09.267 --> 01:00:13.137
so it's funny for me to push her away.

01:00:13.807 --> 01:00:15.977
The expression "push
her away" is funny too.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:17.977
That's why...

01:00:18.507 --> 01:00:19.484
It's hard to be honest.

01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:21.553
(Sang Won is struggling
to talk to her with honesty.)

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:25.517
(Between Ye Eun and Ji Won,
Sang Won feels frustrated.)

01:00:25.817 --> 01:00:29.957
(In the 1st floor living room,
they are eating night snacks.)

01:00:29.987 --> 01:00:31.533
- Did you enjoy it?
- We are eating dumplings.

01:00:31.557 --> 01:00:32.863
We finished this already.

01:00:32.887 --> 01:00:34.197
- Did you really?
- Yes.

01:00:34.427 --> 01:00:35.897
Was it good?

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:37.667
The dumplings are good.

01:00:39.067 --> 01:00:42.997
So Hyeon Jun decided
to settle on the first floor.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:45.537
Why did you cook that?

01:00:46.507 --> 01:00:48.783
- That looks so good.
- Ji Yung is so simple-minded.

01:00:48.807 --> 01:00:50.107
Where's Yeong Gyeong?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.653
She's upstairs, talking to Sang Won.

01:00:52.677 --> 01:00:53.777
Is he?

01:00:56.517 --> 01:00:58.617
It's very quiet today.

01:00:59.547 --> 01:01:02.187
I think today, people are choosing to talk

01:01:03.057 --> 01:01:04.733
in private, rather than
talking in a big group.

01:01:04.757 --> 01:01:06.573
- Is that it?
- Is today a cheat day?

01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:08.527
(This looks so good.)

01:01:09.727 --> 01:01:12.503
The ballerina is binge-eating!

01:01:12.527 --> 01:01:14.367
- What's going on?
- It's the stress.

01:01:14.567 --> 01:01:15.713
- It is the stress..
- She's stressed.

01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:16.714
(Stress makes Ye Eun...)

01:01:16.738 --> 01:01:20.607
(and Ji Yung binge eat.)

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:25.947
(After relieving stress, Ji Yung leaves.)

01:01:26.577 --> 01:01:28.253
(Ye Eun and Ji Won...)

01:01:28.277 --> 01:01:30.623
(are left.)

01:01:30.647 --> 01:01:32.747
Is it Ji Won and Ye Eun?

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.817
It's them again.

01:01:35.617 --> 01:01:36.733
Oh, dear.

01:01:36.757 --> 01:01:37.887
(Hesitating)

01:01:37.987 --> 01:01:39.157
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear.

01:01:41.127 --> 01:01:42.588
What is it?

01:01:42.612 --> 01:01:45.258
(Ye Eun and Ji Won are left.)

01:01:45.282 --> 01:01:47.422
Is it Ji Won and Ye Eun?

01:01:48.022 --> 01:01:49.422
It's them again.

01:01:50.352 --> 01:01:51.428
Oh, dear.

01:01:51.452 --> 01:01:52.638
(Hesitating)

01:01:52.662 --> 01:01:53.922
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear.

01:01:55.762 --> 01:01:57.192
What is it?

01:01:58.732 --> 01:02:00.602
How was today's date?

01:02:02.362 --> 01:02:03.508
(They talk about each other's date.)

01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:04.872
Are they talking about it again?

01:02:11.372 --> 01:02:12.542
My gosh.

01:02:17.682 --> 01:02:18.882
It was fun.

01:02:19.582 --> 01:02:20.752
How was your date?

01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:24.722
- I had fun too.
- How was Sang Won?

01:02:27.862 --> 01:02:28.968
What do you think of Sang Won?

01:02:28.992 --> 01:02:30.272
(What do you think of Sang Won?)

01:02:30.432 --> 01:02:34.032
I think he tries to lead the conversation.

01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:41.002
What is it?

01:02:45.912 --> 01:02:47.712
(Hesitating)

01:02:47.982 --> 01:02:50.858
- I want to...
- You want to get to know him more?

01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:52.522
I want to get to know him better.

01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:59.962
You don't care for Ji Yung, right?

01:03:00.222 --> 01:03:01.662
(Nodding)

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:04.732
So it's Sang Won.

01:03:07.702 --> 01:03:09.732
(Nodding)

01:03:11.002 --> 01:03:16.148
(Ye Eun confirms that Ji Won
has feelings for Sang Won.)

01:03:16.172 --> 01:03:17.448
- Goodness.
- It's suffocating.

01:03:17.472 --> 01:03:18.572
This is crazy.

01:03:20.612 --> 01:03:22.188
Ji Won already asked

01:03:22.212 --> 01:03:24.552
how their date went and heard everything.

01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:26.452
Now that they are alone,

01:03:26.652 --> 01:03:29.222
she asked Ye Eun the
question all over again.

01:03:29.692 --> 01:03:32.098
When there was Bon Hee,
and the three of them talked,

01:03:32.122 --> 01:03:35.522
she heard that they talked about
the things she didn't know about.

01:03:35.692 --> 01:03:39.278
"What if their date went
better than our date?"

01:03:39.302 --> 01:03:40.508
She must be worried about that.

01:03:40.532 --> 01:03:43.978
She must've also wanted

01:03:44.002 --> 01:03:45.172
to compare their dates.

01:03:45.402 --> 01:03:48.672
Ji Won used to say she
had feelings for Ji Yung.

01:03:48.772 --> 01:03:50.688
Ye Eun could feel confused.

01:03:50.712 --> 01:03:52.982
Ye Won consistently said
she had feelings for Sang Won.

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:55.912
But Ji Won voted for him too.

01:03:56.252 --> 01:03:57.652
That's why there's that tension.

01:03:57.912 --> 01:03:59.798
I think the girls need to talk
to each other and resolve it.

01:03:59.822 --> 01:04:01.498
- It got all tangled up.
- It's all tangled up.

01:04:01.522 --> 01:04:03.598
The girls need to talk.

01:04:03.622 --> 01:04:06.538
Honestly, if I was

01:04:06.562 --> 01:04:08.298
one of the older women,

01:04:08.322 --> 01:04:10.532
and I was in that
situation like two of them

01:04:11.062 --> 01:04:13.978
"I used to be interested in Ji Yung,"

01:04:14.002 --> 01:04:16.502
"but I am now interested in
Sang Won." I wouldn't say it.

01:04:17.332 --> 01:04:18.602
Why would I?

01:04:18.832 --> 01:04:21.842
You're here to find love,

01:04:22.042 --> 01:04:23.848
not to make friends.

01:04:23.872 --> 01:04:25.688
That's your first motive.

01:04:25.712 --> 01:04:28.018
Of course, it's fine if you don't say that.

01:04:28.042 --> 01:04:30.652
But after talking so much about myself,

01:04:30.782 --> 01:04:32.128
it would be nice if you
talked about yourself

01:04:32.152 --> 01:04:33.482
- a little too.
- No, thanks.

01:04:33.552 --> 01:04:34.728
That's what you do.

01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:35.729
(Hurt)

01:04:35.753 --> 01:04:36.952
That's what you do.

01:04:37.352 --> 01:04:39.198
We are not a good match.

01:04:39.222 --> 01:04:41.492
(Sick of it)

01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:44.847
(After the tense night, morning comes.)

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:55.297
(Waiting for coffee, Sang
Hyeon cleans the kitchen.)

01:04:58.727 --> 01:05:03.283
(So Hyun comes to
the kitchen just in time.)

01:05:03.307 --> 01:05:04.637
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:05:05.437 --> 01:05:07.977
(Smiling)

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:09.377
What are you doing?

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:13.277
I came down for some
coffee, so I made coffee.

01:05:14.117 --> 01:05:15.677
You drink coffee.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:18.517
Do you drink it every morning?

01:05:18.617 --> 01:05:20.917
I struggled a lot yesterday,

01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:24.287
so I thought I should
drink a lot of coffee today.

01:05:26.427 --> 01:05:28.257
My face got swollen too.

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:30.327
Is it swollen? Why is it swollen?

01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:32.127
- Did you cry?
- No, I didn't.

01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:41.207
(The two start the morning with giggles.)

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.347
(Bon Hee and So Hyun's room)

01:05:44.877 --> 01:05:47.677
I am very curious about
what we will do today.

01:05:51.387 --> 01:05:53.793
I went to heat up something in the morning.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:56.563
Sang Hyeon was doing something,

01:05:56.587 --> 01:05:58.227
and he didn't look good.

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.633
Did he look bad?

01:05:59.657 --> 01:06:01.397
He said his face is swollen.

01:06:02.767 --> 01:06:04.927
He must be younger than
me. Why is he so weak?

01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:06.567
Right.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.043
It's just that So Hyun is in good shape.

01:06:09.067 --> 01:06:11.007
(So Hyun is bothered by Sang Hyeon.)

01:06:12.877 --> 01:06:14.707
(Yawning)

01:06:16.207 --> 01:06:18.123
It's tiring to go on two dates in a day.

01:06:18.147 --> 01:06:19.917
(Sang Hyeon looks unusually tired.)

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:23.217
She's getting a vitamin drink for him.

01:06:23.517 --> 01:06:25.593
- Goodness.
- She's worried about him.

01:06:25.617 --> 01:06:28.263
That's the charm of an older woman.

01:06:28.287 --> 01:06:29.847
(So Hyun gets a bagful of supplements.)

01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:31.787
You are pretty.

01:06:33.997 --> 01:06:37.067
(So Hyun goes around
looking for Sang Hyeon.)

01:06:37.097 --> 01:06:38.843
(She desperately looks for Sang Hyeon.)

01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:40.567
(Peeking)

01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:44.367
(She finds Sang Hyeon.)

01:06:45.837 --> 01:06:46.937
Where is she going?

01:06:48.177 --> 01:06:51.147
(She sees Sang Hyeon and goes downstairs.)

01:06:53.117 --> 01:06:55.677
(Awkward)

01:06:58.317 --> 01:07:00.617
I went to give him a vitamin.

01:07:00.857 --> 01:07:03.227
But all the guys were
there, so I just came back.

01:07:03.727 --> 01:07:05.833
A vitamin? What vitamin?

01:07:05.857 --> 01:07:08.757
I saw Sang Hyeon in the
morning, and he looked really tired.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.343
I went upstairs, and everyone was there.

01:07:12.367 --> 01:07:14.873
They were all there, so I
saw him and came back down.

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:17.183
It's embarrassing to give him
something when everyone is there.

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:18.713
- Right.
- Of course.

01:07:18.737 --> 01:07:20.483
- Did you just come down?
- I just came down.

01:07:20.507 --> 01:07:22.253
- You didn't give it to him?
- I will give it to him later.

01:07:22.277 --> 01:07:23.777
It's nice that you're caring for him.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:27.017
She should give it to
him when they are alone.

01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:28.223
(He agrees.)

01:07:28.247 --> 01:07:30.593
Someone else might be
interested in me, you know.

01:07:30.617 --> 01:07:33.117
- You don't need to show it.
- Right.

01:07:34.057 --> 01:07:36.563
- I love how proactive she is.
- I know.

01:07:36.587 --> 01:07:38.287
- Right.
- It's amazing, isn't it?

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.803
Nobody else has done it.

01:07:40.827 --> 01:07:43.243
- Only she does it.
- Right. But she doesn't overdo it.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.573
- Yes.
- That's a huge plus.

01:07:45.597 --> 01:07:46.737
She's so cheerful.

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.467
Yesterday, - Yes?

01:07:51.107 --> 01:07:53.007
Did you talk to Hyeon Jun well?

01:07:53.377 --> 01:07:56.207
Right. Well.

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:58.907
I felt sorry.

01:07:59.477 --> 01:08:00.493
Why?

01:08:00.517 --> 01:08:02.817
He was like a small pigeon

01:08:04.117 --> 01:08:06.287
- that got his heart broken.
- A pigeon?

01:08:06.387 --> 01:08:08.793
- Pigeon?
- I don't know how to describe him.

01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:11.257
- He was like this.
- He looked weak.

01:08:12.487 --> 01:08:14.327
I asked him to talk.

01:08:15.497 --> 01:08:17.367
And he was all depressed?

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:21.773
It was very clear

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:23.567
that his feelings were hurt.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:26.307
Did you talk to him well?

01:08:29.377 --> 01:08:34.523
After hearing what he had
to say, I was going to talk.

01:08:34.547 --> 01:08:35.847
But Sang Won came.

01:08:37.217 --> 01:08:39.117
We had fun talking together,

01:08:39.387 --> 01:08:41.493
but Hyeon Jun might still

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:43.757
feel uncertain.

01:08:44.227 --> 01:08:46.597
I didn't get to tell him
my side of the story.

01:08:48.597 --> 01:08:52.873
How was it with Sang
Won? After talking to him?

01:08:52.897 --> 01:08:54.097
Well,

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:56.967
to be honest...

01:08:57.437 --> 01:09:00.937
He's fun to me.

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:04.407
He's really fun. We are a great match.

01:09:04.947 --> 01:09:07.477
- Honestly, in here...
- She likes being with Sang Won.

01:09:09.617 --> 01:09:12.317
In here, he's the only
one I am interested in.

01:09:13.787 --> 01:09:16.833
- She's leaning towards him.
- He's the only one

01:09:16.857 --> 01:09:17.987
I'm interested in.

01:09:18.727 --> 01:09:19.757
I love how clear she is.

01:09:20.097 --> 01:09:24.803
I actually expressed how
I feel about Sang Won

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.167
in the most blatant way possible.

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:33.637
If I put it honestly,

01:09:36.807 --> 01:09:38.553
I've done as much as I could,

01:09:38.577 --> 01:09:40.547
but compared to that, he literally

01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:42.377
doesn't even budge an inch.

01:09:43.187 --> 01:09:44.547
He doesn't even move.

01:09:45.787 --> 01:09:47.857
I haven't said a lot,

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:50.333
but he seems to be a lot
more cautious than I thought,

01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:52.437
and he seems to think
about things a lot to himself.

01:09:53.227 --> 01:09:57.797
But from my perspective,
how I feel on the inside is

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.773
that I'm frustrated and disappointed

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.283
that he doesn't make any moves.

01:10:03.307 --> 01:10:04.667
Right, she could feel that way.

01:10:04.937 --> 01:10:08.937
So, I prefer it when
someone is clever and clear.

01:10:09.437 --> 01:10:11.847
- And proactive.
- Of course, that's a must.

01:10:11.947 --> 01:10:13.217
I think

01:10:13.317 --> 01:10:16.793
yesterday's approach was a
little too strong, in my opinion.

01:10:16.817 --> 01:10:18.663
- Like saying, "Why won't you talk?"
- I know

01:10:18.687 --> 01:10:19.664
I speak quite directly.

01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:20.987
That's what you said.

01:10:22.657 --> 01:10:25.303
Maybe, if you were to
approach him in a way

01:10:25.327 --> 01:10:26.304
that made him feel more comfortable

01:10:26.328 --> 01:10:29.333
I think it would be better
if you could seep in.

01:10:29.357 --> 01:10:30.443
I thought that to myself.

01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:31.827
How should I do that?

01:10:31.897 --> 01:10:34.537
So, if you really want to talk to him,

01:10:34.637 --> 01:10:37.083
rather than asking him,
"Why won't you talk to me?"

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:41.207
You could kind of go like,
"Shall we talk for a bit later?"

01:10:41.307 --> 01:10:43.383
"Or not, if you don't want
to. Shall we talk for a bit?"

01:10:43.407 --> 01:10:44.967
Something like that. It's a bit more...

01:10:45.977 --> 01:10:48.053
- Gosh, how nice of Yeong Gyeong.
- I know.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.723
- This kind of advice is great.
- Right.

01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:50.747
Totally.

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.087
Just expressing yourself in a softer way.

01:10:54.187 --> 01:10:55.164
- "Shall we?"
- The way I speak?

01:10:55.188 --> 01:10:57.327
Yes. "Want to do something?" "Shall we?"

01:10:57.427 --> 01:10:59.503
I thought it might be good to do that.

01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:01.233
So, just soften it up a little.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.597
Honestly, from my perspective,
I've expressed myself so much.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.687
- I've already done so much.
- That's right.

01:11:06.867 --> 01:11:09.867
And in this situation, Ji Won appeared.

01:11:11.007 --> 01:11:12.167
So, from my point of view,

01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:15.377
I don't feel all that
great, if I'm to be honest.

01:11:15.777 --> 01:11:16.783
It would bother her.

01:11:16.807 --> 01:11:17.784
- Right.
- Of course it would.

01:11:17.808 --> 01:11:20.747
But yesterday, he went
on a date with Ji Won.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.087
So, I didn't feel so good.

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.823
- Then...
- Knock-knock.

01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:27.557
(Frozen)

01:11:28.157 --> 01:11:30.203
Gosh, why do I get so many spam messages?

01:11:30.227 --> 01:11:31.927
Gosh, I was so startled.

01:11:32.027 --> 01:11:33.027
What's this?

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:36.133
Gosh, I was so startled just now.

01:11:36.157 --> 01:11:37.143
Me too.

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:38.767
(Ji Won appeared at an unexpected time.)

01:11:39.227 --> 01:11:41.767
(Frozen)

01:11:42.537 --> 01:11:44.883
(Right then, Ji Won came over to
Yeong Gyeong and Ye Eun's room.)

01:11:44.907 --> 01:11:46.167
- Spam?
- Yes.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.183
- Maybe...
- I get so many spam calls.

01:11:50.207 --> 01:11:52.383
You have a number that
someone else used to use.

01:11:52.407 --> 01:11:53.393
- Something like that.
- Is that what it is?

01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:55.093
Isn't there a spam thing?

01:11:55.117 --> 01:11:56.923
(The conversation stopped
with Ji Won's appearance.)

01:11:56.947 --> 01:11:59.423
- Spam...
- Oh, no. How uncomfortable.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:01.757
(The conversation stopped
with Ji Won's appearance.)

01:12:02.457 --> 01:12:04.427
My hair is a huge mess right now.

01:12:09.397 --> 01:12:10.943
(Tutting)

01:12:10.967 --> 01:12:11.944
(Sighing)

01:12:11.968 --> 01:12:13.197
Oh, no. She's just sighing.

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:14.897
Let's do that.

01:12:18.907 --> 01:12:21.377
Oh, yes. Ji Won appeared.

01:12:21.707 --> 01:12:24.153
But here,

01:12:24.177 --> 01:12:28.077
about wanting to get to know someone...

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:30.893
It's not like I can ask,
"Why do you want to..."

01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:32.863
- "Get to know him all of a sudden?"
- Right.

01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.433
- That's true.
- That's right.

01:12:34.457 --> 01:12:38.887
Things were fine until Ji Won showed up.

01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:44.427
Anyway, we do like the same person.

01:12:46.597 --> 01:12:49.037
I can relate to her worries,
but at the same time,

01:12:50.607 --> 01:12:52.367
she's a friendly rival too.

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:58.323
Yes. I guess that's it.

01:12:58.347 --> 01:13:00.253
(Ji Won's feelings have become
clear amid the competition.)

01:13:00.277 --> 01:13:01.277
Yes.

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:06.593
(Ye Eun and Ji Won have
started their competition in earnest.)

01:13:06.617 --> 01:13:08.093
- My gosh.
- What are we going to do?

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:11.227
It was so scary at the
end. I was so startled.

01:13:11.627 --> 01:13:12.627
Knock-knock.

01:13:12.727 --> 01:13:15.033
Gosh, that's fierce.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:18.543
Yes. I mean, all of a sudden,

01:13:18.567 --> 01:13:21.613
a near-destructive love
triangle has been formed.

01:13:21.637 --> 01:13:23.213
(A destructive love triangle)

01:13:23.237 --> 01:13:25.843
"Things were going well with Sang Won."

01:13:25.867 --> 01:13:27.153
The way she said that...

01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:28.807
- Do you mean Ye Eun?
- Yes.

01:13:28.907 --> 01:13:30.653
- That was her nuance.
- She didn't have any competitors.

01:13:30.677 --> 01:13:32.783
Right. She didn't have any competitors,

01:13:32.807 --> 01:13:36.117
but Sang Won wasn't into
her that much, to be honest.

01:13:36.217 --> 01:13:40.257
But unexpectedly, Ye Eun can be innocent.

01:13:40.357 --> 01:13:41.957
I think that wasabi

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:46.127
somehow made her think,
"He's still interested in me."

01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:48.133
- Don't you think so? The wasabi...
- The fact that...

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.503
- Right.
- He brought wasabi was that big?

01:13:49.527 --> 01:13:51.403
- The wasabi. Yes.
- No way. Because of that one thing?

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:52.903
Well, she was really happy at the time.

01:13:52.927 --> 01:13:53.973
(Is that right?)

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:57.607
Sang Won is... We're
rooting for him. We did.

01:13:57.707 --> 01:13:58.967
- Right.
- Of course.

01:13:59.537 --> 01:14:02.707
But on Noona is a Woman
to Me, I didn't think

01:14:03.747 --> 01:14:05.547
he would become such a central figure.

01:14:06.107 --> 01:14:07.793
I never thought he'd be
in the spotlight so much.

01:14:07.817 --> 01:14:10.163
- He has become the main character.
- Right now, the women are...

01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:11.523
Because of Director Park, - Yes.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.723
I didn't think...

01:14:12.747 --> 01:14:15.063
- That's right.
- That the women would have

01:14:15.087 --> 01:14:16.633
- such a hard time. Sorry.
- This is so funny.

01:14:16.657 --> 01:14:18.057
I'm sorry, Director. I didn't know.

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.457
Oh, I got something.

01:14:21.797 --> 01:14:23.503
- Of course...
- We got something.

01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:26.003
(On a tense morning,
they get a text alarm.)

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:28.543
- "Today, you will have..."
- "Over or Below Zero?"

01:14:28.567 --> 01:14:29.597
What's this?

01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:32.083
- "Over or Below Zero?"
- "Over or Below Zero?"

01:14:32.107 --> 01:14:33.553
(Today, you will have Over or Below
Zero Dates. Enter the Secret Room.)

01:14:33.577 --> 01:14:36.823
Oh, we'll have an Over or Below Zero Date.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:38.983
- Over or Below Zero?
- No one is able to guess.

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:41.893
(In the Secret Room, )

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:44.917
(a mysterious box has appeared.)

01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:47.633
(Pick only one piece of paper.)

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:49.537
(Over Zero: Water sports,
Below Zero: Ice rink)

01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:54.697
(A random group date
based on the result of a draw)

01:14:55.227 --> 01:14:57.597
I wanted to go on a date with Bon Hee.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:01.097
I wanted to go with Sang Hyeon.

01:15:01.337 --> 01:15:04.043
The people I go with matter a lot.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.807
I think I was nervous the whole time.

01:15:06.137 --> 01:15:09.947
Obviously, I want to go with Sang Won.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:12.683
I didn't mind either location.

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:15.847
I just wanted to be in the
same place as Sang Won.

01:15:16.547 --> 01:15:18.963
Oh, there are slips of paper
with Over or Below Zero on them.

01:15:18.987 --> 01:15:21.533
- Then, that's just random.
- It is.

01:15:21.557 --> 01:15:22.933
They must be split into two groups.

01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:29.203
(Who will go with whom
on the 5-on-5 group dates?)

01:15:29.227 --> 01:15:30.703
It's their first time going on group dates.

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:31.704
This sounds like so much fun.

01:15:31.728 --> 01:15:35.097
I'm sure there must be awkward
and uncomfortable relationships too.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:38.067
If they end up going together,
I'm curious what might happen.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:41.077
The older women and younger
men are actually kind of

01:15:42.007 --> 01:15:43.347
in a huge mess.

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:46.517
So, no matter how they get split up,

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.747
one of the teams will
definitely be a huge mess.

01:15:49.987 --> 01:15:51.987
So I'm looking forward to it.

01:15:52.987 --> 01:15:54.663
One team will be very entertaining.

01:15:54.687 --> 01:15:56.017
(Looking forward to it a lot)

01:15:56.487 --> 01:15:57.727
I should take this.

01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:02.427
Thick socks.

01:16:02.697 --> 01:16:03.973
Thick ones... Thicker than these?

01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:07.043
- Because skates are very stiff.
- Skates?

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:08.313
They must be in Below Zero.

01:16:08.337 --> 01:16:09.943
(So Hyun and Bon Hee
both chose Below Zero.)

01:16:09.967 --> 01:16:11.637
Is anyone going to do water sports?

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.183
Water sports.

01:16:13.207 --> 01:16:14.653
- Is anyone doing water sports?
- She's like, "This way."

01:16:14.677 --> 01:16:16.747
- No one? Water sports?
- Who's doing water sports?

01:16:17.977 --> 01:16:19.853
I'm going to the ice rink.

01:16:19.877 --> 01:16:21.847
Are you ice too? Water?

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.263
(Nodding)

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.147
So, 2 for ice, 3 for water.

01:16:27.387 --> 01:16:30.127
Does anyone have
sunscreen? I didn't bring any.

01:16:30.227 --> 01:16:31.957
Sunscreen? I have brightening cream.

01:16:33.027 --> 01:16:35.233
- What happened?
- The same team!

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.203
- Really?
- Ye Eun and Ji Won! The same team!

01:16:37.227 --> 01:16:38.967
- Oh, no!
- Look at Ji Won's face!

01:16:39.067 --> 01:16:40.267
Oh, no!

01:16:40.937 --> 01:16:43.367
- The ice rink.
- Are you ice too? Water?

01:16:44.037 --> 01:16:45.014
I just got goosebumps.

01:16:45.038 --> 01:16:46.367
So, 2 for ice, 3 for water.

01:16:46.837 --> 01:16:48.537
This is the actual situation.

01:16:48.807 --> 01:16:51.747
Does anyone have
sunscreen? I didn't bring any.

01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:55.293
We have to see who the men are.

01:16:55.317 --> 01:16:57.323
I'm happy. Hey, you're here.

01:16:57.347 --> 01:16:58.893
- Hello.
- Hang on.

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:00.393
You're all dressed so differently.

01:17:00.417 --> 01:17:01.933
Who's doing water sports?

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:03.157
- Water sports?
- That's me.

01:17:03.257 --> 01:17:04.737
Are you two going to do water sports?

01:17:05.427 --> 01:17:06.404
Water sports?

01:17:06.428 --> 01:17:07.873
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun
got matched for the Over Zero Date.)

01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:09.657
- Oh, they end up like this?
- Water sports?

01:17:09.797 --> 01:17:11.757
- The lucky ones end up together.
- Water sports?

01:17:12.727 --> 01:17:14.997
Water sports? Are you two
going to do water sports?

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:18.907
- Oh, have a good time.
- Is he not?

01:17:19.007 --> 01:17:20.477
- Oh, really?
- No.

01:17:20.577 --> 01:17:22.377
- Really?
- It was just a random draw.

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.277
- That's a shame.
- Is it the two of you?

01:17:24.377 --> 01:17:25.354
Sang Won.

01:17:25.378 --> 01:17:26.817
- No.
- Are there three?

01:17:27.717 --> 01:17:32.547
Actually, from the beginning
all the way until now,

01:17:32.947 --> 01:17:37.527
ever since I went on the date with
Sang Won where we made makgeolli,

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:40.703
I've been wanting to

01:17:40.727 --> 01:17:43.927
go on a date with Sang Won.

01:17:44.197 --> 01:17:46.973
The timing was really disappointing.

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:48.643
- Gosh, Ye Eun must feel so...
- Have you

01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:50.113
- I feel bad for her.
- All been to a barge?

01:17:50.137 --> 01:17:51.583
Who else is going to the barge?

01:17:51.607 --> 01:17:53.007
For the men, it's me and Hyeon Jun.

01:17:53.577 --> 01:17:54.713
- The two of you?
- Yes.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:55.714
Date again?

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:58.177
How could just those two
women be on the same team?

01:17:58.847 --> 01:18:02.523
It was the two men I saw
yesterday who were home alone.

01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:05.247
Then, I found out that the
rest were on Team Below Zero.

01:18:06.047 --> 01:18:09.193
"Shoot, I want to go to Below Zero too."

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.897
- That's what I kept thinking.
- Oh, dear.

01:18:11.227 --> 01:18:13.057
By the way, I didn't have a choice.

01:18:13.457 --> 01:18:15.297
I was the last to go in,

01:18:15.397 --> 01:18:17.397
so I just took the one that was left.

01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:19.443
- I didn't choose this.
- We'll be back.

01:18:19.467 --> 01:18:20.573
- We'll let you know.
- Have fun.

01:18:20.597 --> 01:18:23.113
For real. I wanted to pick Below Zero.

01:18:23.137 --> 01:18:24.383
- But I got Over Zero.
- I might catch the flu.

01:18:24.407 --> 01:18:25.643
- I'm disappointed.
- I don't know.

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:29.153
Gosh, but she just expressed
herself really honestly.

01:18:29.177 --> 01:18:31.253
Shoot, that sounds like fun.

01:18:31.277 --> 01:18:32.283
- Good luck.
- This is my first time at a barge.

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.877
But today, it kind of...

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.347
Let's go, everyone.

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.963
- Have fun, guys. Bye!
- See you later.

01:18:37.987 --> 01:18:39.393
Have fun. Bye.

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:40.793
- We'll have a good time.
- Bye.

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:41.857
That sounds like fun.

01:18:43.087 --> 01:18:44.803
Mu Jin, Bon Hee, - Bon Hee.

01:18:44.827 --> 01:18:47.227
Sang Hyeon, Sang Won, and So Hyun?

01:18:47.497 --> 01:18:49.373
So Hyun. That's right.

01:18:49.397 --> 01:18:51.077
(What changes will the group dates bring?)

01:18:51.167 --> 01:18:53.497
(Finally, the Over or
Below Zero Dates begin.)

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:57.343
(Ji Won and Ye Eun's
uncomfortable silence...)

01:18:57.367 --> 01:18:59.567
(from a date without Sang Won)

01:19:00.107 --> 01:19:01.977
(Let's go!)

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.123
(I'm so happy today.)

01:19:04.147 --> 01:19:05.777
(Really?)

01:19:06.817 --> 01:19:09.123
(Those who are happy on their date...)

01:19:09.147 --> 01:19:12.147
(and two people who feel
uncomfortable on their date)

01:19:15.657 --> 01:19:18.803
(Meanwhile, how is Team Below Zero doing?)

01:19:18.827 --> 01:19:21.727
(After only being on 1-on-1
dates, a group date is fun.)

01:19:23.097 --> 01:19:24.697
(So Hyun had a big fall.)

01:19:25.197 --> 01:19:27.413
(Are you okay?)

01:19:27.437 --> 01:19:29.697
(I think I was kind of
disappointed in Sang Hyeon.)

01:19:30.407 --> 01:19:32.207
(I'll hold your hand from now on.)

01:19:32.437 --> 01:19:34.407
(I wish time would go slowly from now on.)

01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:37.777
(A new excitement blossomed
on the random group date.)

01:19:38.777 --> 01:19:39.754
(So, )

01:19:39.778 --> 01:19:42.277
(there was something
I wanted to say earlier.)

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:43.793
(I wanted to...)

01:19:43.817 --> 01:19:45.787
(talk more with Mu Jin.)

01:19:46.317 --> 01:19:47.687
I could just talk to him.

01:19:48.087 --> 01:19:49.563
(Mu Jin's feelings are important, )

01:19:49.587 --> 01:19:50.757
(but so are your feelings.)

01:19:50.857 --> 01:19:52.503
(I don't think it's right not to talk to him...)

01:19:52.527 --> 01:19:54.533
(because I'm trying to tiptoe around.)

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:56.503
(Anyway, you might feel bothered, )

01:19:56.527 --> 01:19:57.973
(but you told me that you don't mind.)

01:19:57.997 --> 01:19:59.103
(How could I not feel bothered?)

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.867
(Of course, I mind.)

01:20:03.197 --> 01:20:05.443
(And finally, the moment...)

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.207
(that they must face each
other's age has come.)

01:20:09.007 --> 01:20:12.423
(I was born...)

01:20:12.447 --> 01:20:13.547
(in the year...)

01:20:14.117 --> 01:20:17.317
(19xx)

01:20:17.717 --> 01:20:22.133
(The older women face the
reality they had forgotten about.)

01:20:22.157 --> 01:20:25.027
(I was...)

01:20:25.857 --> 01:20:26.903
(After hearing their ages, )

01:20:26.927 --> 01:20:29.727
(I don't think I was able to
hide my facial expression.)

01:20:29.827 --> 01:20:31.043
He must have a lot on his mind.

01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:33.427
(The wall of age has come to Yeon House.)

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:38.807
(What changes will come to
Yeon House after the age reveal?)

01:20:38.983 --> 01:20:40.983
