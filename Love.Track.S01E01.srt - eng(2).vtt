00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:45.091
Are you crying?

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.128
These onions are really strong.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.432
That's why I took it off the menu.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:57.403
Really?

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:58.504
No.

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:00.773
Come on.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.309
Why do you keep saying that?
Are you messing with me?

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:06.012
Every time you ordered it,

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:07.813
I peeled onions like that.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.749
That's part of your job.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:12.218
I also clean the pharmacy
without complaining...

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:13.419
when a younger pharmacist tells me to.

00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:14.754
Because that's my job.

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:16.289
The 15th of every month.

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:19.058
How did you know?

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.627
You always came in on the 15th
looking like you'd chewed on dirt...

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.129
and ordered onion soup.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:27.567
I didn't look like I chewed on dirt.

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.439
You make the onion soup today.

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:36.509
I thought I only had to peel onions.

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:40.012
You should learn how to make it
if you plan to eat it on your own later.

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:42.782
I told you. I'm not selling it anymore.

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.551
I mean, why aren't you...

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.022
Should I tell you my recipe or not?

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.559
Please tell me.

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.196
The key to onion soup...

00:19:57.997 --> 00:19:59.065
is waiting.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.003
On low heat, very gently,

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.572
stir constantly so it doesn't burn.

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:12.445
Okay.

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:18.284
How long is "constantly?"

00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:20.119
About 40 minutes.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.587
Forty minutes?

00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:23.823
It really takes that long?

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:28.060
That's why the flavor is so deep.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.328
That's strange.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.931
When I ordered it,
it felt like it came out in ten minutes.

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:34.233
I prep in advance.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.102
I can't make customers wait that long.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:38.471
But you never know
if anyone will order it or not.

00:20:39.372 --> 00:20:40.873
What if no one orders?

00:20:42.642 --> 00:20:43.776
Then I throw it away.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.748
What are you doing?

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.483
I told you to keep stirring
so it doesn't burn.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:56.422
These onions are starting to cook down.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:59.025
If you keep cooking,
the onions turn brown.

00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:01.260
That's called caramelization.

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:05.064
Just keep going for another 35 minutes.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:07.466
Thirty-five more minutes?

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.337
You can go take a break.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.340
They're brown.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:54.447
It's not perfect,

00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.248
but okay.

00:21:56.883 --> 00:21:58.351
- Add the water.
- Okay.

00:22:16.636 --> 00:22:17.703
This smell.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.006
You recognize it, right?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.642
What's next?

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:24.377
That's it.

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.179
- What?
- Simple, right?

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.382
That's all there is to onion soup.

00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:32.285
But all I did was cook onions.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.454
The key to onion soup...

00:22:36.556 --> 00:22:37.790
is waiting.

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:40.793
Time itself is the recipe.

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:45.164
Spending time cooking and waiting.

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.501
That's all.

00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:53.973
Waiting.

00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:57.376
Slice the bread like this.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.979
Then place the slices like this.

00:23:03.182 --> 00:23:04.350
Top lots of cheese,

00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:07.119
and bake for ten minutes in an oven.

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.022
I don't have an oven.

00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:14.060
Then just use the microwave.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.729
- You just need to melt the cheese.
- Okay.

00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:36.649
But what did you mean earlier?

00:23:37.483 --> 00:23:38.551
About what?

00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:39.852
In front of the restaurant,

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:42.688
you said I was too cruel to my joy.

00:23:44.824 --> 00:23:45.925
You know,

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:50.196
my food isn't a dumping ground
for emotions.

00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:52.531
That's not what I meant.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.000
Then what did you mean?

00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:57.236
Your irritation, anger, depression,

00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:59.005
sadness, pain, anguish.

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.674
You just pour them all out and leave.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:04.310
That's not it at all.

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:08.247
Then what is it?

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:11.484
Actually,

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:15.354
there's nothing fun in my life.

00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:17.623
Nothing to look forward to.

00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:20.092
Every day feels the same.

00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:25.231
So...

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:30.102
it feels like I've accomplished nothing,
even though I try hard.

00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:31.671
I feel like I've just gotten older.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.108
I'm really boring, right?

00:24:38.544 --> 00:24:39.412
No.

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:45.818
You're incredibly, unbelievably boring.

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:53.659
And then I found...

00:24:55.094 --> 00:24:56.095
your warm onion soup.

00:25:18.818 --> 00:25:19.685
What?

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:22.521
Is it too sad to eat
because it's the last onion soup?

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:24.423
No.

00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:27.093
You made it today,

00:25:27.093 --> 00:25:30.062
so you can cook it at home anytime.

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:35.868
I'll enjoy it.

00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:55.621
It's so good, so I'm asking.

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:57.390
Can you please just sell it again?

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.858
Don't take it off the menu.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:01.928
I didn't want to wait.

00:26:03.796 --> 00:26:04.630
What?

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.299
I didn't want to wait for you.

00:26:08.034 --> 00:26:11.504
That's why I took onion soup off the menu.

00:26:12.204 --> 00:26:13.239
What are you...

00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:16.576
You're joking again, right?

00:26:16.576 --> 00:26:17.610
This one's...

00:26:18.811 --> 00:26:19.745
not a joke.

00:26:21.514 --> 00:26:22.715
But why...

00:26:28.688 --> 00:26:29.722
Welcome.

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.673
What can I get you?

00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:49.242
What's the hottest dish on the menu?

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.913
Onion soup. Shall I get you that?

00:27:04.724 --> 00:27:06.726
Anyone would think the world had ended.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.265
I hope this gives him some energy.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.334
Enjoy your meal.

00:27:40.226 --> 00:27:41.894
How was the dish?

00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:44.297
Yeah, it was so,

00:27:44.564 --> 00:27:45.965
so delicious.

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:47.767
Thank you.

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:51.270
That's a relief.

00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:57.109
At first, it was interesting...

00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:01.814
how different you were
before and after eating it.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.056
It was also kind of funny.

00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.482
I enjoy your dish every time.

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:41.387
Thanks.

00:28:42.355 --> 00:28:43.289
Bye.

00:28:50.263 --> 00:28:51.831
That's when I started waiting...

00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:56.135
for the look on your face
when my food made you happy.

00:28:57.637 --> 00:29:01.040
Today's onion soup prep was perfect.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.044
Is he not coming today?

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.759
He must be doing better lately.

00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:23.162
Since he's not coming for onion soup.

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:31.938
But I realized...

00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:35.975
that meant I had to wait
for you to be unhappy,

00:29:37.476 --> 00:29:40.046
since you only came for onion soup...

00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:43.449
when you were tired,
depressed, and unhappy.

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:47.019
What?

00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:48.688
Waiting for you to be unhappy...

00:29:49.322 --> 00:29:51.924
just so you'd come to my restaurant.

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.628
I didn't like that at all.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.066
So I took onion soup off the menu.

00:30:02.168 --> 00:30:03.336
I thought the entire universe...

00:30:04.103 --> 00:30:06.072
wanted me to be miserable.

00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:12.478
Now that you've tried it, you know.

00:30:14.013 --> 00:30:15.114
It's nothing special.

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:18.751
From now on,

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:20.553
make it yourself.

00:30:58.157 --> 00:30:59.025

I looked it up
because I wanted to know what it meant.

00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:26.052
What else is good here besides onion soup?

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:30.556
Everything.

00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:33.259
Because I made it.

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:34.093
Then,

00:31:34.794 --> 00:31:36.462
I'll come back and try everything,
one by one.

00:31:37.496 --> 00:31:38.598
From now on,

00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:42.501

00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:46.539
