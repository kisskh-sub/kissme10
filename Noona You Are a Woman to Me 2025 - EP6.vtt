WEBVTT

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.120
(A new older woman has appeared in Yeon House.)

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.760
(Go So Hyun, the fifth older woman)

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.170
(I've never seen anyone like her in my life before.)

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.760
(She's a beauty.)

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.039
(I'm really curious.)

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.670
(She's on another level.)

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.479
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.580
(A new older woman who will bring change to Yeon House has appeared.)

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.950
(Can we talk for a bit?)

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.849
(Ye Eun suddenly asked to talk to Sang Won.)

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.890
(I went on a date with Mu Jin.)

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.390
(But you popped into my head.)

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.789
(You seemed bored...)

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.329
(during our date.)

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.330
(Me?)

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.336
(I had so much fun during our date yesterday.)

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.499
(You'll notice it more when we're alone together, )

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.700
(but we don't really connect.)

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.070
(Choose who you go after wisely.)

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.039
(It's become a bigger mess.)

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.549
(I have a lot on my mind now.)

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.749
(I've always been interested...)

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.880
(in Bon Hee since the beginning.)

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.990
(But Mu Jin and Bon Hee seem inseparable.)

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.029
(If the two are already close, )

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.100
(I can't go on a date with her.)

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.559
- That's unfair.
- It's fine.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.369
(Even if we're close, it's a fair competition.)

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.940
(I'm only thinking about my feelings.)

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.080
(The younger men are starting to show their true feelings.)

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.950
(And that night, the Secret Room opened.)

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.320
(Bon Hee received the most Love QR Codes.)

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.049
(Bon Hee, who was curious about...)

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.720
(Mu Jin on her first Secret Room visit, )

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.089
(wanted to know about...)

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.530
(Sang Hyeon this time.)

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.430
(Who does Bon Hee have feelings for now?)

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.929
Invisible sparks of emotion...

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840
- are going off everywhere.
- Yes.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.069
- Sang Hyeon truly shocked me.
- It's getting wild.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.709
How could he say that in front of Mu Jin?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.080
- He provoked Mu Jin.
- Gosh.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.879
It's as if we should set up a boxing ring.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.309
- Things feel hostile.
- Right?

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.990
- There's an invisible boxing ring.
- Yes.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.449
Here's what made me proud.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.650
I thought Sang Hyeon was quiet and calm.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.819
But his charms are working.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.319
- Are they?
- Yes. It seems like...

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.159
So Hyun has become...

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.230
interested in him after Yeong Gyeong.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.860
If he manages to win his way into Bon Hee's heart,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.229
I have a feeling he can do something with the three women.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.000
- Do what?
- Did I go too far?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.099
No.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.540
No, it was fine.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.910
Yeon House. I love it.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.309
(Sang Hyeon is out on the terrace?)

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.520
Why is he on the terrace?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.449
To work out.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.090
(Starting his day with a morning workout)

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.919
(From working on his lower body with squats first...)

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.360
(to a full-body exercise)

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.469
(Sang Hyeon starts the day with determination...)

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.370
(by working out in the morning.)

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.200
- Is that Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.940
- His style has changed.
- Right?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.309
"Male participants, please head over..."

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.610
"to enjoy breakfast."

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.179
Only the men?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.749
(Touching with care)

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.760
(Excited, the younger men get ready eagerly.)

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.589
(Meanwhile, the older women are still in bed.)

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.060
The younger men generally get up early.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.499
(Things have become awkward...)

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900
(between Sang Hyeon and Mu Jin since their chat last night.)

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.940
(Moving it without any reason)

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.509
Let's go.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.309
(Putting the awkwardness behind them, )

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.950
(the men are off to the breakfast spot.)

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.559
- What are we doing today?
- I'd like to know.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.860
(What kind of breakfast is waiting for the younger men?)

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.030
(Because of yesterday, Sang Hyeon's mind is a mess.)

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.429
Ji Yung,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.330
- Yes?
- are you all in on Yeong Gyeong?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.630
Not all in.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.800
But I've only ever talked to Bon Hee for two days straight.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.740
It'd be nice to have a talk with Yeong Gyeong.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.810
- I thought you'd be...
- Yes?

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.010
Interested in So Hyun.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.419
- Same here.
- So Hyun?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.579
- Yes.
- Right.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.490
I was actually taken aback yesterday.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.949
Because she's your type?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.950
I like women who have...

00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.959
- simple features.
- Exactly.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.440
- And she gives off that vibe.
- Yes.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.730
(Ji Yung felt a strong attraction to So Hyun's appearance.)

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.970
- My ideal type...
- Yes?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.499
Is similar to the other three.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.599
We're attracted...

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.000
- to our first impression.
- Right.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.879
It didn't seem like that was the case for you and Sang Won.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.709
But I think that makes it harder. You have a lot more to think about.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.509
- I do have an ideal type.
- You do?

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.419
The first person I was attracted to was Bon Hee.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.979
- Appearance-wise?
- Yes, appearance-wise.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.789
It made me want to talk to her.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.390
He's not hiding it anymore.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.389
But from the beginning,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.230
her votes naturally went to Mu Jin.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.429
He kept getting chances,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.200
which led to the two developing feelings for each other.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.569
I still waited, hoping we'd get...

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.170
a chance to go on a date.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.739
So he waited.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.970
(I see.)

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.409
But if the two are inseparable...

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.410
(But if the two are inseparable...)

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.479
It doesn't matter.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.680
If you like her and want to talk to her, why not do it?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.649
I've talked to Bon Hee.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.890
We had a private chat late in the night.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.590
- You asked to talk?
- Yes.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.230
I asked if we could talk for a bit, and we did.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.229
"I am interested in you, and I want to talk to you."

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.499
"I want to go on a date with you, but I don't have the chance,"

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.220
- You told her that?
- "which is a bummer."

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.900
(Impressed)

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.310
I'm sure she knows.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.710
But not giving me a chance, despite knowing it,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.409
would be her way of expressing her feelings, no?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.650
That's what I think.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.349
- So she has someone else in mind?
- Yes.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.880
No answer is also an answer.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.750
That is also...

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.590
It's really tough.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.589
What will Sang Hyeon do?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.470
(Sang Hyeon is waiting for Bon Hee to respond.)

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.029
This also crosses my mind.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.600
After hearing about our ages...

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.800
If Mu Jin turns out to be much younger than me...

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.939
- He did say the gap is bigger.
- You'd get...

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.109
- a chance?
- I do think there might be...

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.440
a chance for me.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.410
He's certain that Mu Jin...

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.610
is younger than him.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.149
But Sang Hyeon is hoping Mu Jin is way younger than him.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.420
- Only then would Bon Hee...
- Right.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.419
- feel a bit more burdened.
- Listen.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.059
Here's what I find funny.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.129
Sang Hyeon thinks Bon Hee...

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.500
might lose interest in him if the age gap is big.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.029
But why does he think that?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.929
- That's a stereotype.
- Yes.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.669
- Rather...
- It's a prejudice.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.740
Why can't he think that it might act as a booster?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.070
(That's possible.)

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.379
The age gap could be 11...

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.710
- or 13 years.
- That could happen.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.479
(Thinking)

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.979
I'm curious.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.480
- Once we disclose our ages, - Yes?

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.849
Would our feelings waver?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.989
I think so, for sure.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.589
- Really?
- Everyone would waver.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.860
I'd be fine with it.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.190
Unless the age gap is too big,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.000
- it'd be the same.
- What about a ten-year age gap?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.270
I'm okay with a bigger gap.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.230
But I think the others would...

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.339
- Hesitate?
- hesitate,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.570
if I'm being honest.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.269
"He's way younger than I expected."

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.340
Way younger? I get it.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.940
If that crosses their minds,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.509
there will be a change.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.510
You're right.

00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:48.991
- Of course, things would change.
- Once they know their ages.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.990
(How will the ages affect each other?)

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.389
By the way, where are they heading to?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.660
(The younger men have arrived at the date spot.)

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.070
- There's a creek.
- A group breakfast.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.799
- A creek right next to us.
- Had I known,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.869
I'd have brought my swimsuit.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.310
(A breakfast spot next to the creek)

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.239
- There's one more chair.
- Right.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.570
(5 younger men but 6 chairs)

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.780
It'd be hilarious if another guy shows up.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.609
- We'd have to brother it up.
- Yes.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.109
Jump into the water as a group...

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.686
- with our arms around each other.
- Nice.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.120
So six guys?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.820
- I can't cook anymore.
- That's too many people.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.649
Too many.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.160
(Who will take the remaining seat?)

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.859
It's So Hyun.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.700
(So Hyun, the fifth older woman, has arrived.)

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.029
Here she comes.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.299
- Right. She needs a chance.
- She's here.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.800
(Who?)

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.940
Hi.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.809
- Yes.
- Right.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.340
So Hyun needs to be given a chance.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.940
Should we get up?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.649
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.079
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.149
(Getting up automatically)

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.680
- Hi.
- Good morning.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.790
(Smiling)

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.289
What a great morning.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.419
- Yes, good morning.
- Good morning.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.159
- Take a seat.
- We're having breakfast, right?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160
Sorry?

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.160
(Glancing)

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.830
(The younger men who couldn't greet her because they joined in later)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.539
- Yes.
- Totally.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.109
(A 5-to-1 breakfast date for So Hyun)

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.869
I rarely felt jealous of a junior.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.980
Are you jealous right now?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.450
Honestly, I'm quite jealous today.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.380
Why not join in next season?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.179
I've already talked to the production team.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.349
- Really?
- I asked them to make a show...

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.190
for those over mid-40.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.819
How about "EXchange?"

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.990
(Woo Young's recommendation)

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.490
(Losing it)

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.159
- "EXchange?" - Yes.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
With whom?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160
I wouldn't know.

00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:42.259
(It's up to you.)

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.370
Hye Jin, that is what we're truly curious about.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.169
(Keep a poker face.)

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.490
Turn the camera off for a minute.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.939
(Turn the camera off for a minute!)

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.540
(- You little... - I'm joking, Hye Jin.)

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.040
(I shouldn't be laughing.)

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.779
- I heard this was the benefit.
- Good.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.280
- This?
- So it's a benefit.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.619
It must make you happy.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.079
Of course. When will I ever get a chance...

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.520
to go on a date with five guys at the same time?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.219
What's more, we're all younger than you.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.260
Exactly.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.429
- She's right.
- Totally.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.730
- Nice.
- I'm a queen.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.360
- We'll treat you really well today.
- Thank you.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.799
Don't do a thing. We'll help...

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.029
- We'll do everything.
- debone the food.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.069
Gosh.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.140
(Feeling grateful)

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.069
(Out of the 5 younger men, )

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.839
(who does So Hyun want to know about the most?)

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.410
I'm dead curious.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.110
Who I wanted to know about...

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.620
was Sang Hyeon.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.190
The way he talks...

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.419
is nice.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.180
(So Hyun sent a Love QR Code to Sang Hyeon.)

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.629
I wanted to talk to Sang Hyeon...

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.160
as soon as possible.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.269
(Sang Hyeon is clueless about So Hyun's feelings.)

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.299
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.340
(Is the food here?)

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.770
It looks good.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.369
Here you go.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.239
The food looks delicious.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.110
- Chicken soup is a must.
- Yes.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.910
Please dig in.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.210
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.580
- Go ahead.
- Okay, I'll try the soup first.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.060
(Nodding aggressively)

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.689
- It's really good.
- Is it?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.690
Yes.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.529
- Do you have a hobby?
- What?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.130
A hobby. What do you do on your day off?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.560
- My hobby?
- Yes.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.430
I think I was asked the same question yesterday.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.039
- You were.
- Right?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.069
(Sang Won asked the same question.)

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.639
- My hobby.
- I was given a chance...

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.010
to greet So Hyun first.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.720
But it's true that I couldn't chat...

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.980
as much as I wanted.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.779
(Last night, when he first met So Hyun)

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.879
Working out...

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.040
Do you like Japanese cuisine?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.390
(Impatient, Sang Won bombarded So Hyun with questions.)

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.460
Disappointed,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.530
I decided to change my attitude.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.099
I'm going to get to know people I'm interested in with enthusiasm.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.999
With that, I was determined to get to know So Hyun the next day.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.240
(Sang Won made up his mind to get to know So Hyun.)

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.810
My hobby.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.339
I like watching movies at home...

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.480
and visiting exhibitions.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.079
Exercising.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.649
- Yes, exercising as well.
- It's a hobby.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.779
- He's showing off.
- He answered for you.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.520
(Feeling proud for some reason)

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.980
(Glancing)

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:17.950
Tell me about your hobbies.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.790
I like working out and golfing.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.460
So you golf.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.860
For me, golf is quite hard.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.529
Personally, I think...

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.329
golf is a lot harder to pick up than tennis.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.930
- Yes.
- It's a static sport.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.100
Finding the fun in it takes a long time.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.499
- When did you start?
- What?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.640
When did you start?

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.969
- It seems like.
- Two years ago?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.039
Two years?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.210
(That's not long.)

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.909
I like traveling.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.549
I often go on a one-day trip.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.126
(The two guys react immediately to So Hyun.)

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.790
(Swatting)

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.620
- If I suddenly feel like it, - Yes?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.959
I just get up and go on a trip.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.160
I'm jealous of his spirit.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.460
It's only possible if one has a driving force.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.730
I'm jealous.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.329
As for me, I don't have one.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.539
My hobbies are quite ambiguous.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.670
(Moving forward)

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.979
(Interested and focused)

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.480
I read a bit...

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.380
or go to coffee shops alone to take care of some things.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.819
I also play games. Those are my hobbies.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.379
- Games?
- Yes, I like gaming.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.419
Like what?

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.989
(Her eyes are fixed.)

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.259
Online games I can play with my friends.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.890
- Computer games?
- Yes.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.059
Now that we've grown older, my friends have become busy,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.600
and we can't meet up. We also live in different places.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.999
That's why we gather through games.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.069
- Is that so?
- Yes, we meet online.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.899
And gathering online is nice.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.040
(Nodding aggressively)

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.670
You've got several hobbies.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.080
Like a variety of hobbies. They may be static,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.680
- True.
- but hobbies are still hobbies.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.910
(Glancing)

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.389
- What's your ideal physical type?
- What?

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.889
What's your ideal physical type?

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.419
My ideal physical type?

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.490
Ideal physical type.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.120
(Curious)

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.989
Here's what I realized.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.690
You know when a couple goes on a date,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.899
the guy puts his arm around the woman's shoulders,

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.269
and the woman wraps her arm around his waist...

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.799
while walking?

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.440
That's a dream for models.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.040
- Since models are tall.
- When that happens,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.739
I hope the guy is tall enough so that...

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.260
- I don't have to hunch over.
- You want him to be tall enough?

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.149
Did it look nice?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.979
No, it was too uncomfortable for me.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.050
It was uncomfortable?

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.089
- It's from experience.
- Yes.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.189
- Like this.
- You went through it.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.750
- Because you have to hunch over?
- You become disproportionate.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.260
We always have to hunch over.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.059
(Realizing it)

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.100
For real.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.830
- To think there's such a hassle.
- It's truly uncomfortable.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.499
That's why when I date someone smaller than me...

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.110
Here's how I usually walk.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.380
(She's really tall.)

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.079
If I have to walk side by side with a smaller boyfriend,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.009
worried he might feel intimidated by my height...

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.750
(Hunching over)

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.720
- I see.
- You get it, right?

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.090
This is what you call true love.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.160
That is the very reason my back is a mess now.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.530
It helped me realize...

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.969
how nice it would be if our heights...

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.700
had a good distance.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.799
- Did you say you were 168cm tall?
- Yes, I'm 168cm tall.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.439
How tall are you guys?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.809
- I remember you being 188cm.
- He's 188cm.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.910
Correct.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.009
- I'm 181cm tall.
- You're 181cm.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.649
- Everyone is tall.
- Sang Hyeon is...

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.650
All the guys are tall.

00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:33.479
- I'm a little short of 190cm.
- You're not 190cm?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.679
- A little short of 190cm.
- Why are you so tall?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.819
(Busted)

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.889
- You're lying, aren't you?
- He's a tiny bit short of it.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.349
- Just a tiny bit.
- So you're a little short of 190cm.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.489
Actually, a little short of 180cm.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.859
(Confessing)

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.589
- We're all similar in height.
- Yes, it seems like it.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.430
I'm a little short of 170cm myself.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.700
There's that meme.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.999
The meme about whole chicken soup and Buldak instant noodles.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.069
- What is that?
- A meme?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.640
A meme about your partner.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.579
Someone who's stable yet less proactive,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.179
- I didn't know about it.
- while Buldak...

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.179
is someone who's unstable yet very proactive.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.049
People had different values.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.410
(Whole chicken soup versus Buldak)

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.350
- Who do you prefer?
- Me?

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.720
Whole chicken soup.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.919
(Exclaiming)

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.690
Really? I thought it'd be Buldak.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.160
I think my proactivity is more than enough.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.830
What's more, I've dated men who were proactive,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.070
but those who were stable were better.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.140
(I got it.)

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.639
Whole chicken soup all the way.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.740
(Thinking)

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.950
I like someone who's proactive.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.120
I'm someone who's a whole chicken soup.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.000
- A full whole chicken soup.
- I'm more of a...

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.389
It'd be nice to learn such a side from my partner.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.159
Getting along well together feels great.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.676
(Getting along with someone opposite feels great.)

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.870
I can provide the stability, you know?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.970
Something like that.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.270
Talking about whole chicken soup while eating whole chicken soup.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.749
Whole chicken soup versus Buldak.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.849
They played a balance game.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.049
It must be a trend among millennials and Gen Z.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.449
I choose whole chicken soup.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.489
(Woo Young's choice)

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.790
- Whole chicken soup.
- Yes.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.960
Well, Buldak...

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.589
Have you been hurt by Buldak?

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.260
Ultimately, Buldak isn't good for your body.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.259
- True.
- Is it from experience?

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.870
Spiciness that's too provocative...

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.870
hurts your gut.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.840
So you've met a woman who hurt your gut.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.370
As for me,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.439
boredom is my least favorite in the world.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440
He's certainly young.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.209
- So, I prefer Buldak far more.
- Right.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.210
- Far more?
- Yes.

00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:50.019
Can you be straightforward like him?

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.189
- You keep beating around the bush.
- He says his gut hurt.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.620
Tell me about it.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.159
- I also want whole chicken soup.
- Really?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.730
Dating a Buldak-like guy...

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.360
hurts my body and soul.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.730
See? It hurts.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200
You've also been to the hospital.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.800
No, I don't want whole chicken soup.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.229
- Seriously?
- You'd choose Buldak?

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.439
We're not talking about marriage here.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.799
It's about dating. Why would you want chicken soup?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.269
So, it's whole chicken soup if you had to marry him?

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.010
I still don't think I could marry a guy who's like chicken soup.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.979
I just want to live a flamboyant life and leave.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.110
- Okay.
- It's boring.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.519
You date people because you want to have fun.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.620
So, have you always dated Buldak-like guys?

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.790
Mostly.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.720
(Admiring)

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.729
(Meanwhile, in Yeon House where only older women are left)

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.099
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.159
We're here to see you, Ye Eun.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.099
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.900
Let me watch you do your hair.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.640
I'm not good at it, so I just do it.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.040
Do you want me to help you?

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.110
Were you chosen last night?

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.380
- I did get one vote.
- Good for you.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.419
I got zero.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.220
I'm not doing so well either.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.189
Right. Ye Eun picked Sang Won the night before,

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.019
- but Sang Won picked Ji Won.
- Yes.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.359
But they don't know who they chose.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.040
(Ye Eun and Ji Won don't know about this.)

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.730
- I almost cried last night.
- Me too.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.870
I actually cried the day before yesterday.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.609
I've always gotten zero votes.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.340
So have I.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.810
- Poor them.
- Poor them.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.510
Why am I so unpopular?

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.380
Same here.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.190
I don't know why.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.219
I think I'm more popular with women.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.220
Me too.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.890
- That's good, right?
- I like you too.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.200
(Two women who both want Sang Won comfort each other.)

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.239
Should we eat bagels?

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.740
- You're hungry, right?
- Yes.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.039
Where are all the men, though?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.380
Maybe they're in their rooms.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.079
- They're not here!
- It's totally empty.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.050
They're on a date with So Hyun.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.749
- I usually eat a small breakfast.
- Okay.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.426
- But I'm going to eat a bunch.
- Let's cheer up.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.789
- Let's cheer up.
- Let's eat and cheer up.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.290
- Right.
- We need to be invigorated.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.630
- Enjoy your food!
- Enjoy your food!

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.600
(Bon Hee joins them for breakfast.)

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.969
- It's good.
- Is it good?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.500
You slightly frowned because it was so good.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.070
This is my first bite of the day, but it's too sweet.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.879
I feel good again.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.139
(You're right.)

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.180
I feel much better.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.950
I wonder how we'll go on dates today.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.180
I know, right?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.680
Who do you want to go on a date with?

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.690
I actually had...

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.359
so much fun with Sang Won yesterday,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.400
so I'm interested in him.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.500
What about you, Bon Hee?

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540
(Laughing)

00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:57.909
I have to say his name, right?

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.910
It'd be nice...

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.710
if I could go with Mu Jin.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.310
- I see.
- Or Sang Hyeon.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.480
Sang Hyeon is the one I'm curious about.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.079
From talking with him yesterday?

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.520
(Nodding)

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:17.290
(Sang Hyeon asked her for a chat the night before.)

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.600
(I wanted to go on a date with you today.)

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.569
(Sang Hyeon confessed his feelings, )

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.030
(and she became curious.)

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.570
What about you, Ji Won?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.710
I want Ji Yung.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.010
(I see.)

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.209
Though I don't think he's that interested in me,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.779
but I want to try talking to him.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.819
- That's good.
- But...

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.049
it looked like Ji Yung was...

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.189
interested in you, Ji Won.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.660
But I actually think...

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.600
he's more interested in Yeong Gyeong.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.999
What if he is?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.970
You can win him over if you like him.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.469
(Bon Hee is so cool!)

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.539
"You can win him over."

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.009
What did I just hear?

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.609
(Doubting her ears)

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.939
What if he is?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.639
You can win him over if you like him.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.310
Yes, I'm going to have a chat with him.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.949
Fighting for it is also a form of love.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.950
- Yes.
- That was a great line.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.420
(Ji Won braces herself once again.)

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.459
- Are you finished?
- Yes, I really enjoyed it.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.629
(So Hyun's breakfast date ends.)

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.660
Let's get in.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.400
- Get in this one.
- Pick the car you want.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.046
- Whose car is this?
- Whatever you like.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.499
My truck doesn't drive so smoothly,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.739
- Really?
- but it's fine in the front seat.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.799
Pick whichever car you want.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.110
(Waiting for now)

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.410
I wanted to get in the car where Sang Hyeon was.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.750
- Sang Hyeon.
- Obviously.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.950
Then, she could wait and see and follow him.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.589
(Only So Hyun and Sang Hyeon are left.)

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.119
- Will you take the front seat?
- Me?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.619
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.620
(Sang Hyeon lets So Hyun take the passenger seat.)

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.989
(Ji Yung politely opens the door for her.)

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.430
Oh, right. It was your own truck.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.730
It's a cute truck.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.939
It suits you so well.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.599
But Sang Hyeon just...

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.170
told her to sit in the front.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.410
He took the other car?

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.539
- Why?
- What...

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.710
- It's pretty high.
- It's fine.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.949
(Turning)

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.890
I turned, and Sang Hyeon wasn't there.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.419
I thought, "I guess he's not interested in me."

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.890
- No way.
- What?

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.459
But it's natural to think that way.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.029
I'll drive you there safely.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.200
(Is Sang Hyeon not interested in So Hyun?)

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.570
Oh, dear.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.740
Is he really not interested?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.240
- Never.
- He's...

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.639
- Is that what guys think?
- I think...

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640
Is it?

00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:51.479
Judging from the stride he took to the car behind it...

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.510
Not even a little?

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.719
(He's not even regretting it a little.)

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.120
He safely escorted her,

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.119
so he's on his way.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.750
Oh, no.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.789
If a guy were interested in her,

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.119
he would have definitely gotten in that car, right?

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.489
I would have found a way...

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.059
- to get in the same car with her.
- I see.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.529
So, I don't think he's exactly interested in her.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.029
(Sang Hyeon isn't interested in So Hyun?)

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.170
Oh, no.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.439
The weather's so nice, though.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.640
- I know, right? It's not too hot.
- It's not that hot.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.209
It was a great date, guys.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.690
- Good work today.
- Good work today.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.539
We had delicious food, thanks to you.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.550
Let's head inside.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.080
She seems cheerful for once.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.050
Where is everyone?

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.890
Oh, there you are.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.560
Where were you?

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.719
We went to eat a whole chicken soup next to a creek.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.229
- Seriously? Whole chicken soup?
- Yes.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.399
It was so good. I needed to be invigorated.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.699
Did you dip your feet in the water?

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.329
- I couldn't.
- You didn't do that?

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.629
We only joked about it,

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.669
- like, - Really?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.770
"You're going in soon."

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.439
Hi.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.340
- I heard you ate chicken soup.
- I did.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.969
- Were you at home the whole time?
- Yes.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.279
- Did you eat?
- We had a simple meal.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.340
What did you eat?

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.580
He's going straight to her.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.119
- What did you eat?
- We chatted and ate.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.819
Bell pepper, bananas, bagels...

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.820
(Clearing his throat)

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.750
How can he like her that much?

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.290
(Smiling)

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.259
Did you guys drink coffee there?

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.729
- No.
- You only ate the chicken soup?

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.129
Yes, that's why we went.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.630
Oh, my gosh.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.439
They must be dying to be alone.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.640
- I know, right?
- Right.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.570
Will we go somewhere today?

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.409
Probably in the evening.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.580
- In the evening?
- Yes.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.510
To eat delicious food.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.580
- What?
- I'm always reflecting on myself.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.180
(Mu Jin is about to make coffee.)

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.419
- How was the weather outside?
- It was lovely.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.360
- Was it?
- The creek was cool.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.490
- The weather's nice today.
- Is it?

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:46.830
Did you have coffee?

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.860
I did, but that made so little.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.530
I do want another cup.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.199
- Pour some water into it.
- Thank you.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.840
(Mu Jin instantly hands over his coffee.)

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.549
- We had whole chicken soup.
- What?

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.149
- Whole chicken soup.
- Yes, I heard.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.350
- Did you?
- Yes.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.390
Did you know she was the only woman going out?

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.890
She told me as she was getting ready this morning.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.389
She had to get ready, so she told me.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.459
(They share even trivial things.)

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.460
(Smiling)

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.040
Did Yeong Gyeong say she didn't have to eat?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.039
- She hasn't eaten anything?
- She hasn't?

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.760
- She didn't eat anything.
- What do we do?

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.479
She should eat fruits instead.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.509
(The night before)

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.280
I'll have to ask for your consideration.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.019
I have a patient from another country...

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.620
who made an appointment 3 months ago.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.820
(She skipped breakfast due to work in the morning.)

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.390
Oh, no. Here goes the Yeong Gyeong enthusiast.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.359
(Hyeon Jun came upstairs to find her.)

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.770
- Yeong Gyeong, you didn't eat?
- No.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.539
- Aren't you hungry?
- I am.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.939
Did you eat?

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.170
- Yes, I had chicken soup.
- Was it good?

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.179
How about I cook you a meal? Just a simple one.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.210
I'd like that.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.109
- "How about I cook you a meal?" - That was nice.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.719
- So cool.
- It didn't even matter to him.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.190
He didn't even need to talk about the chicken soup.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.489
He gets straight to the point.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.920
All right, Hyeon Jun.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.460
- Hyeon Jun is so sweet.
- Yes.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.859
How is he so sweet?

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.259
Kimchi fried rice?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.260
Right. He did mention he'd make fried rice before.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.570
(Yeong Gyeong hurriedly comes downstairs.)

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.939
Are you making kimchi fried rice?

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.470
Yes. It was the quickest thing I could make.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.110
He's such a sexy chef.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.810
What are you cooking?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.880
(Grinning)

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.009
- It's kimchi fried rice again.
- I like it.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.450
I didn't have that many ingredients.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.319
(Sang Hyeon gives them privacy.)

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.489
I should get some groceries.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.920
All we need is kimchi.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.690
- Give me just a minute.
- Sure.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.090
How was work this morning?

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.430
- Me?
- Yes.

00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:04.260
Yes, I worked hard on treating my patients.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.429
I had put 4 to 5 appointments into this morning.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.100
- Oh, you dealt with all of them.
- Yes.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.510
What do your employees say?

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.909
They're so curious.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.709
They look like a married couple.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.310
- About other participants?
- Yes.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.409
They're like "How many are there?"

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.279
- And about who you like?
- "Are you interested in anyone?"

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.450
They asked me that.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480
(Smiling)

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920
(Pleased)

00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:27.319
This couple is so stable.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.120
They make you feel at ease.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.720
They're so cute.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.490
What kind of boss are you?

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.260
- Me?
- Yes.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.929
I can't tolerate any mistakes,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.199
so I'm scary...

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.470
when they shouldn't make mistakes.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.470
I can't imagine you being scary.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.740
- Me?
- Yes.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.210
I can be pretty scary when I'm angry.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:48.309
(Finding her cute)

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.040
Do you talk like a sloth even then?

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.240
I do.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.080
An angry sloth.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.179
They have such good chemistry,

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.850
so they make me feel comfortable.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.219
Something smells delicious.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.960
- Come here if you're hungry.
- You can eat it if you're hungry.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.560
Who's hungry?

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.099
Eat up. You must be starving.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.360
He made it quickly.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.399
Take a photo of me, please.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.299
Do you want a photo?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.470
Like that? It looks perfect.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.969
(Yeong Gyeong is excited and leaves a photo.)

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.840
Just a second.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.509
- I have...
- The fried rice has to show.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.780
- I've never imagined this.
- In 1, 2, 3.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.009
(Food after work made by Hyeon Jun)

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.079
It's cute.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.150
(Shy)

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.580
- That's cute.
- Yeong Gyeong...

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.349
can be chic and cold like a city woman,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.419
- but she's also cutesy.
- Totally.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.159
She's very attractive.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.560
I want to be like Yeong Gyeong.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.130
She's elegant.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.290
You're also elegant when you're not talking.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.770
I should speak less.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.639
Thank you for the food.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.700
Thanks for the food.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.110
(Nom)

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.540
(Moaning)

00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.580
It's good.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.910
- Is this your first meal?
- Yes.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.620
It's delicious.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.490
(Yeon Gyeong's first meal that Hyeon Jun made)

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.220
That feels good.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.459
(Proud and satisfied)

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.530
- I'm jealous.
- It's so nice.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.400
- They got a text.
- We got a text.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.069
Only the younger men got it.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.140
They did.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.499
Date tickets.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.510
What is it?

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.110
- Three minutes?
- Three minutes.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.510
The men will have a competition.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.509
- Private Glamping Date.
- Private Glamping Date?

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.230
- Three-Minute Match?
- Three-Minute Match?

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.050
The men will have the Three-Minute Match.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.650
What's a Three-Minute Match?

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.149
They make me physically compete against these fit guys.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.250
(The moment has come.)

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.119
- Seriously?
- This is so harsh.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.529
- Are you going to warm up?
- Get warmed up.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.629
I'm going to get changed.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.130
- This is war.
- It is.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.070
(The younger men's 3-Minute Match)

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.140
They set things up.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.809
(Push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups)

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.139
- Oh, no.
- Sit-ups and push-ups?

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.209
- Taking turns?
- One minute each.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.339
"The man with the highest total count..."

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.380
"gets a chance to go on the Private Glamping Date?"

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.580
Glamping sounds fun.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.649
- There's a handicap for you.
- You get a handicap.

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.719
- I do?
- Yes.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.400
- Ten seconds.
- You get ten seconds less.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.619
- It's 50 seconds each.
- So, 50 seconds each?

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.260
- Yes, 50 seconds each.
- You should do it in 50 seconds.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.060
- That was necessary.
- It was.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.559
Glamping in that weather sounds so good.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.729
(They must win to go glamping with the older woman they want.)

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.870
(Determined)

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.969
Who wants to go first?

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.740
Who wants to go first?

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.510
Let's do it, Sang Won.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.909
(Sang Won goes first.)

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:38.910
(Sighing)

00:31:38.911 --> 00:31:41.380
Oh, no. It's Sang Won.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.379
- Oh, no.
- Look at his fair arms.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.689
I don't know about others,

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.920
but I was dispirited as if I ran into a wall.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.360
It was a game that I could never win.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.799
(Sang Won has zero confidence from the start.)

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.930
Get ready.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
(Nervous)

00:31:58.001 --> 00:31:59.470
- Go, dermatologist.
- Ready.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.500
Get set. Go!

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.140
One...

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.640
Get set. Go!

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.470
- One, two...
- One, two...

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.010
- He's better than I thought.
- That's not bad.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.880
- Five...
- He's good.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.009
He said he was bad at it on purpose.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.050
Eight,

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.779
nine... He downplayed it.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.690
He was a doctor,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.859
so I assumed...

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.590
he wouldn't have much time to work out.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.490
I was surprised.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.230
He puffed out his chest and everything.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.730
I was genuinely surprised.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.340
I'm terrible at this.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.470
He's acting weak again.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.039
- He might have the best form.
- Right.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.840
He lowers our expectations first.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.640
He's doing better than I thought.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.649
He has such good form.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.579
- He does.
- He's good! What?

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.919
Six, seven...

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.049
- Sang Won!
- That's so surprising.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.720
I know, right? He's good!

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.220
- This is surprising.
- How can this be?

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.360
He's good.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.060
- Good luck.
- It's Hyeon Jun.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.820
He could do pull-ups there on his feet.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.869
He's already doing one.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.930
Like this.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.269
(Laughing)

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.369
You're already up there.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.669
(Is Hyeon Jun relaxed?)

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.370
- All right.
- Don't go easy on them.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.880
(He looks awkward.)

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.740
Get set. Go!

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.650
- He's too tall.
- I know.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.520
One, two...

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.019
Go higher!

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.019
(Struggling)

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.420
- I'm so bad at this.
- Oh, no.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.059
- It's because he's tall.
- Yes.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060
Right.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.329
Oh, boy.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.560
(You can do it.)

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.599
(He does his best, although the bar's too low.)

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600
Eight.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:42.439
Ten, nine,

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.600
- I'm done.
- eight...

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.040
- Great work.
- Good job.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.169
- His height was a disadvantage.
- Exactly.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.340
He's too tall for it.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.609
(Looking up)

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.649
It's Mu Jin.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.980
(Looking forward to it)

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.249
(Mu Jin confidently goes third.)

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.349
Mu Jin.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.090
- We'll start counting.
- I'll start.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.920
They must be good at different things, right?

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.620
Get set. Go.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.589
One, two,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.690
- three, four, - He's good!

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.130
- five, six, - Five, six,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.730
- seven, eight, - seven, eight,

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.440
- nine, ten...
- nine, ten...

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800
Four,

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.709
five...

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.910
(Consistent)

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.740
(How is he so good?)

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.209
Thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.519
thirty-nine,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.180
forty, forty-one,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.050
forty-two, forty-three...

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.260
I didn't expect him to be so good at it,

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.990
but he worked really hard.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.160
I could tell that he was giving it his all.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.500
- He worked so hard.
- It was so cool.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.869
- They're certainly amazing.
- Right.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.870
That's incredible.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.040
They're really good.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.339
(Feeling pressured)

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.380
Who's next?

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.680
(Sang Hyeon goes fourth.)

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.650
It must be so much pressure.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.619
Good luck.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.190
(Looking forward to it)

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.530
(Composed)

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.659
I've been working out...

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.470
every day except for on day two.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.699
Sang Hyeon is good at this.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.269
- He works out every morning.
- You're right.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.439
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.909
He looks like he's got a sleeper build.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.539
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.009
Everyone said that the match was...

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.450
for Ji Yung, the new guy.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.819
Everyone seemed to think so,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.590
but I actually thought...

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.360
they were giving me a chance.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.700
That was on my mind.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.630
I'm going to do my best.

00:35:54.923 --> 00:35:56.483
(Composed)

00:35:57.153 --> 00:35:58.692
I've been working out...

00:35:58.693 --> 00:36:02.423
every day except for on day two.

00:36:03.323 --> 00:36:04.632
Sang Hyeon is good at this.

00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:07.162
- He works out every morning.
- You're right.

00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:08.402
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

00:36:08.403 --> 00:36:10.802
He looks like he's got a sleeper build.

00:36:10.803 --> 00:36:12.502
(He secretly did bodyweight exercises every day.)

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:16.002
Everyone said that the match was...

00:36:16.003 --> 00:36:19.343
for Ji Yung, the new guy.

00:36:20.513 --> 00:36:22.742
Everyone seemed to think so,

00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:24.483
but I actually thought...

00:36:24.753 --> 00:36:28.283
they were giving me a chance.

00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.553
That was on my mind.

00:36:30.753 --> 00:36:33.593
I'm going to do my best.

00:36:34.053 --> 00:36:35.592
He sounds extremely confident.

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:38.363
Because I also want to look good.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.862
He wants to look cool.

00:36:39.863 --> 00:36:42.802
I really hope that Sang Hyeon wins...

00:36:42.803 --> 00:36:45.432
- Sang Hyeon?
- and goes on a date with Bon Hee.

00:36:45.433 --> 00:36:46.802
Please, let it happen.

00:36:46.803 --> 00:36:48.943
- I want to see them together.
- Right.

00:36:50.303 --> 00:36:52.712
Ready. Set. Go.

00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:53.942
(Sang Hyeon can't lose in this game.)

00:36:53.943 --> 00:36:55.143
Go.

00:36:56.783 --> 00:36:59.082
- Three, four...
- Three, four...

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.152
(He's doing it fast in the right position.)

00:37:00.153 --> 00:37:03.122
- Six, seven, eight...
- Six, seven, eight...

00:37:03.123 --> 00:37:05.299
(Now they can believe that he's been working out secretly.)

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.552
(Impressed)

00:37:06.553 --> 00:37:08.792
- Five, six...
- Five, six...

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:12.762
(He won't slow down.)

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.263
Ten. He's good at it.

00:37:15.963 --> 00:37:18.172
Sang Hyeon is doing it most properly of all.

00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:19.733
That's the right way of doing pull-ups.

00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:23.242
He did way better than I expected.

00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:25.173
He seemed cool to me.

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:28.082
- He impressed Bon Hee.
- Oh, my. Sang Hyeon.

00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:29.743
He declared war the day before.

00:37:30.183 --> 00:37:31.413
He's showing what he can do.

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.682
One, two,

00:37:34.683 --> 00:37:36.423
- That's the textbook position.
- three...

00:37:37.053 --> 00:37:38.553
Should he sit all the way up? Four.

00:37:39.093 --> 00:37:40.153
- Five.
- Five.

00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:43.222
Sang Hyeon did a great job.

00:37:43.223 --> 00:37:45.092
So while counting the numbers,

00:37:45.093 --> 00:37:47.333
I cheered for him subtly.

00:37:48.363 --> 00:37:49.663
I said cheering words.

00:37:50.303 --> 00:37:53.272
- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

00:37:53.273 --> 00:37:54.672
- five, six...
- Oh, he's so cool.

00:37:54.673 --> 00:37:56.219
(Sang Hyeon gives it all he's got to the end.)

00:37:56.243 --> 00:37:58.912
- And 16, 17, 18, 19...
- And 16, 17, 18, 19...

00:37:58.913 --> 00:38:01.882
It was completely unexpected to see that side of him.

00:38:01.883 --> 00:38:05.283
How he tried his best to win...

00:38:05.413 --> 00:38:09.253
made him look like a cool younger man.

00:38:09.383 --> 00:38:12.623
Also, it made my heart flutter.

00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:14.092
Oh, boy.

00:38:14.093 --> 00:38:15.453
- It must be exhausting.
- Indeed.

00:38:16.423 --> 00:38:18.962
- Oh, gosh. Sang Hyeon.
- And 47, 48...

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.162
(He makes the women' hearts flutter. He exudes his charms properly.)

00:38:20.163 --> 00:38:21.463
- Fifty.
- Fifty.

00:38:23.063 --> 00:38:24.502
- He did a lot.
- Indeed.

00:38:24.503 --> 00:38:26.279
(Golden Retriever showed his unexpected charm.)

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:28.342
- That was so cool.
- Indeed.

00:38:28.343 --> 00:38:29.502
How does he do that so fast?

00:38:29.503 --> 00:38:30.702
Exactly.

00:38:30.703 --> 00:38:31.712
- He's really different...
- That was the perfect position.

00:38:31.713 --> 00:38:33.312
Because he's been working out alone.

00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:34.343
Exactly.

00:38:34.483 --> 00:38:36.819
- I didn't do as many as I hoped.
- Everyone is good at it.

00:38:36.843 --> 00:38:37.913
That was unexpected.

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:39.883
(The last player, Ji Yung)

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.453
- I have 50 seconds?
- Yes, 50 seconds.

00:38:41.853 --> 00:38:43.683
- The athlete is here.
- It's neck and neck.

00:38:44.383 --> 00:38:45.652
Ji Yung.

00:38:45.653 --> 00:38:46.653
(Excited)

00:38:46.654 --> 00:38:49.762
Let's begin. Ready. Set. Go.

00:38:49.763 --> 00:38:50.863
How well will he do?

00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:53.832
- Three, four, - Three, four,

00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:56.032
- It's game over.
- five, six,

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.762
- He's muscular and fast.
- seven, eight...

00:38:57.763 --> 00:38:59.033
- He's scary.
- Indeed.

00:39:01.203 --> 00:39:03.042
- One, two...
- Two.

00:39:03.043 --> 00:39:05.072
- Three, four, - Three, four,

00:39:05.073 --> 00:39:07.172
- five, six, - five, six,

00:39:07.173 --> 00:39:08.182
- seven...
- seven...

00:39:08.183 --> 00:39:10.183
- One, two, three, four...
- Four.

00:39:10.243 --> 00:39:11.312
(He's overwhelmingly fast!)

00:39:11.313 --> 00:39:12.382
Seven, eight...

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:14.013
Oh, my. He's really overwhelmingly fast.

00:39:14.053 --> 00:39:15.883
How are they supposed to defeat an athlete?

00:39:18.053 --> 00:39:20.392
- Seventy? Two, three...
- One, two, three,

00:39:20.393 --> 00:39:22.323
- four, five, six...
- He's amazing.

00:39:23.323 --> 00:39:24.393
My goodness.

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:28.402
(We knew he'd do well, but we didn't expect him to do this well.)

00:39:28.403 --> 00:39:29.703
- Eighty. Amazing.
- Time's up.

00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:32.802
(The handicap wasn't a problem for Ji Yung.)

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.903
He's on another level.

00:39:36.143 --> 00:39:37.272
Gosh, I'm tired.

00:39:37.273 --> 00:39:39.973
(Everyone did well, but their faces tell the result.)

00:39:40.943 --> 00:39:42.843
- I did my best.
- Right. I agree.

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:45.282
- Who placed first?
- Ji Yung.

00:39:45.283 --> 00:39:49.082
(Despite the handicap, Ji Yung wins as expected.)

00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:53.023
Great job, everyone. You all did a good job.

00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:56.023
(Disappointed)

00:39:56.163 --> 00:39:58.403
- Shall we give them some water?
- Right. Let's do that.

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.202
It's not really cool though.

00:40:02.203 --> 00:40:03.662
- But still...
- Thank you.

00:40:03.663 --> 00:40:05.733
- Great job.
- Thank you.

00:40:06.873 --> 00:40:08.243
I'll give it to Mu Jin.

00:40:10.143 --> 00:40:12.013
- Thank you.
- You did a good job.

00:40:12.673 --> 00:40:14.142
She takes care of Mu Jin.

00:40:14.143 --> 00:40:15.213
(Glancing)

00:40:17.743 --> 00:40:18.883
You did really well.

00:40:19.913 --> 00:40:21.213
(Happy)

00:40:22.383 --> 00:40:24.083
Oh, gosh. It breaks my heart.

00:40:24.553 --> 00:40:25.722
Right in front of Sang Hyeon.

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:26.852
Gosh. Poor him.

00:40:26.853 --> 00:40:29.723
(Sang Hyeon drinks water with an upset look on his face.)

00:40:30.293 --> 00:40:31.392
He did his best.

00:40:31.393 --> 00:40:34.362
After the game, she came up to Mu Jin...

00:40:34.363 --> 00:40:37.063
and had a chat with him, which I obviously saw.

00:40:38.073 --> 00:40:39.473
It was a little disappointing.

00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.143
Poor him.

00:40:44.343 --> 00:40:45.903
I'm so upset. This is driving me crazy.

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:48.482
- What should he do?
- They were right in front of him.

00:40:48.483 --> 00:40:50.112
My point, exactly.

00:40:50.113 --> 00:40:51.482
What just happened?

00:40:51.483 --> 00:40:54.083
Even though he impressed Bon Hee by showing his athletic ability,

00:40:54.253 --> 00:40:57.283
- Bon Hee gave water to Mu Jin.
- Right.

00:40:57.683 --> 00:40:59.722
It must've hurt Sang Hyeon's pride.

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.563
- He must've been upset.
- Right. I agree.

00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:04.692
I believe that Sang Hyeon will soon...

00:41:04.693 --> 00:41:05.793
make up his mind.

00:41:06.493 --> 00:41:07.692
You're saying he might give up?

00:41:07.693 --> 00:41:10.932
When Bon Hee went up to Mu Jin...

00:41:10.933 --> 00:41:13.933
and gave water to him,

00:41:14.303 --> 00:41:17.442
she wasn't just being kind like she is to everyone.

00:41:17.443 --> 00:41:19.113
- It wasn't like that.
- That's right.

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:21.089
He's the one whom she wants to take care of.

00:41:21.113 --> 00:41:22.113
So he was the first one she gave water to.

00:41:22.114 --> 00:41:23.914
- She doesn't care about the others.
- Right.

00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:26.813
- That's about it.
- From Sang Hyeon's perspective...

00:41:27.713 --> 00:41:30.952
I think it makes him think that there's nothing more he can do.

00:41:30.953 --> 00:41:32.093
Don't you think so?

00:41:32.853 --> 00:41:34.122
I think that's possible.

00:41:34.123 --> 00:41:36.323
- What he just saw...
- It must be discouraging.

00:41:36.423 --> 00:41:37.523
That's right.

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.292
(It's time to choose the one to take on the Private Glamping Date.)

00:41:41.293 --> 00:41:42.363
I choose...

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:46.232
I'm nervous.

00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:47.272
(Who does Ji Yung want to take out on a date?)

00:41:47.273 --> 00:41:48.593
- Who could it be?
- I'm curious.

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:50.273
It must be Yeong Gyeong.

00:41:50.843 --> 00:41:52.012
Pick So Hyun.

00:41:52.013 --> 00:41:54.349
(Is it So Hyun he was with on the whole chicken soup date?)

00:41:54.373 --> 00:41:56.543
(He's walking straight toward her.)

00:41:57.183 --> 00:41:58.213
Let's go together.

00:41:58.483 --> 00:42:00.552
(Ji Yung chose So Hyun.)

00:42:00.553 --> 00:42:01.683
Thank you.

00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:03.982
(Ji Yung's choice is unexpected.)

00:42:03.983 --> 00:42:05.022
- What?
- Yes!

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:06.752
(She's happy for now.)

00:42:06.753 --> 00:42:09.922
- In the morning...
- While having whole chicken soup...

00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:11.563
- That's right. He fell for her.
- Right.

00:42:12.033 --> 00:42:13.733
Oh, yes. I'm going glamping.

00:42:14.263 --> 00:42:16.433
- It's even better as it's glamping.
- Right.

00:42:16.803 --> 00:42:19.973
When we talked this morning at the whole chicken soup place...

00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:23.573
Since she was the only woman and five men were with her,

00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:25.813
she could've felt shy.

00:42:26.613 --> 00:42:28.242
But she actively participated in the conversation.

00:42:28.243 --> 00:42:30.113
She seemed emotionally relaxed.

00:42:30.183 --> 00:42:31.412
So I wanted to talk to her more.

00:42:31.413 --> 00:42:34.922
I wanted to get to know her better.

00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:36.199
(Ji Yung became more curious about So Hyun.)

00:42:36.223 --> 00:42:38.192
(Excited)

00:42:38.193 --> 00:42:39.423
It will be fun.

00:42:41.463 --> 00:42:42.793
I'm disappointed.

00:42:43.293 --> 00:42:45.263
- Oh, no.
- Thank you.

00:42:46.193 --> 00:42:47.392
Good job.

00:42:47.393 --> 00:42:48.902
(The fierce, but romantic match of the younger men is over.)

00:42:48.903 --> 00:42:49.903
Are you eating something?

00:42:49.904 --> 00:42:52.102
- I'm so hungry.
- I'm hungry.

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:53.502
- So I'll eat this yogurt.
- I see.

00:42:53.503 --> 00:42:54.919
- Shall we also eat some?
- I was nervous.

00:42:54.943 --> 00:42:57.903
(Both grunt.)

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.772
We didn't play the game, but we...

00:43:00.773 --> 00:43:01.842
Are you tired?

00:43:01.843 --> 00:43:04.343
- We got nervous while watching it.
- Why am I tired?

00:43:05.053 --> 00:43:06.752
- Sang Hyeon surprised me.
- Right.

00:43:06.753 --> 00:43:07.812
- Sang Hyeon?
- Sang Hyeon?

00:43:07.813 --> 00:43:10.883
Sang Hyeon seemed so determined, which was a new side of him.

00:43:11.283 --> 00:43:12.652
Didn't he do better than expected?

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:14.152
- He did well.
- He did a great job.

00:43:14.153 --> 00:43:17.392
- He must work out a lot.
- Right.

00:43:17.393 --> 00:43:19.792
His body shows how much he's been working out.

00:43:19.793 --> 00:43:21.632
- He has firm fine muscles, right?
- Yes.

00:43:21.633 --> 00:43:23.362
- That's how he looks.
- Also, he doesn't look...

00:43:23.363 --> 00:43:25.072
like he works out with weights.

00:43:25.073 --> 00:43:26.302
- He looks like he's been doing...
- Bodyweight workouts.

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.602
A lot of bodyweight workouts.

00:43:27.603 --> 00:43:29.703
Oh, you can tell that.

00:43:30.403 --> 00:43:33.843
(They found a new side of Sang Hyeon through the game.)

00:43:34.443 --> 00:43:37.082
That one thing made all the women reevaluate Sang Hyeon.

00:43:37.083 --> 00:43:38.183
Exactly.

00:43:38.553 --> 00:43:40.112
- They're all talking about him.
- Right now,

00:43:40.113 --> 00:43:42.022
Sang Hyeon didn't lose anything through the game.

00:43:42.023 --> 00:43:44.582
Bon Hee also said she was surprised.

00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:46.023
(That's right.)

00:43:47.453 --> 00:43:49.492
Are you okay? Doesn't it hurt?

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.623
I'm fine.

00:43:50.863 --> 00:43:51.933
You look a little upset.

00:43:52.633 --> 00:43:53.833
I'm not exactly happy.

00:43:56.603 --> 00:43:58.233
(Smiling)

00:44:01.003 --> 00:44:02.102
(The 1st place and the last place chuckle awkwardly.)

00:44:02.103 --> 00:44:03.643
Oh, he came in last place.

00:44:04.473 --> 00:44:05.913
That was so exhausting.

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:08.783
(The guys gather 1 by 1.)

00:44:09.883 --> 00:44:11.043
But that was...

00:44:11.753 --> 00:44:12.833
Even from my perspective...

00:44:13.353 --> 00:44:14.512
I'm sorry.

00:44:14.513 --> 00:44:15.552
What?

00:44:15.553 --> 00:44:16.682
(Ji Yun is sorry to everyone about the result of the game.)

00:44:16.683 --> 00:44:18.523
I was really nervous while doing it.

00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:21.763
I really did my utmost.

00:44:22.063 --> 00:44:23.463
I gave my 120 percent.

00:44:23.863 --> 00:44:26.092
I just pretended I was confident.

00:44:26.093 --> 00:44:27.573
Or else, I would've been embarrassed.

00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:29.662
- I really did my best.
- You did well.

00:44:29.663 --> 00:44:30.783
- I mean it.
- You did well.

00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:33.673
- I'll get going now.
- Right now?

00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:35.673
Oh, he's going right away.

00:44:36.503 --> 00:44:39.472
Can't I go out on a date with someone too?

00:44:39.473 --> 00:44:40.473
(Glancing)

00:44:43.813 --> 00:44:46.683
(Mu Jin leaves the room.)

00:44:57.223 --> 00:45:00.963
(Mu Jin checks his appearance.)

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.433
(Sighing)

00:45:12.973 --> 00:45:15.443
(Sang Hyeon suddenly leaves the room.)

00:45:16.643 --> 00:45:18.112
(He walks toward the room where Sang Won and Mu Jin are.)

00:45:18.113 --> 00:45:19.353
What? Why is he going there?

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:20.682
He's going to the guys' room.

00:45:20.683 --> 00:45:22.122
(He walks toward the room where Sang Won and Mu Jin are.)

00:45:22.123 --> 00:45:23.723
I was wearing a mask while doing it.

00:45:23.953 --> 00:45:27.252
I think it was Ji Yung who suggested the idea of glamping...

00:45:27.253 --> 00:45:28.562
most strongly of us.

00:45:28.563 --> 00:45:31.223
(Sang Hyeon keeps pacing around and sighs.)

00:45:37.103 --> 00:45:39.103
Mu Jin, can I talk to you?

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.473
(After pacing around for a while, Sang Hyeon calls Mu Jin out.)

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:49.042
I decided to talk to Bon Hee.

00:45:49.043 --> 00:45:50.982
But at that moment, Mu Jin asked...

00:45:50.983 --> 00:45:52.483
if he could...

00:45:53.653 --> 00:45:55.722
go out on a date with someone.

00:45:55.723 --> 00:45:57.923
And I heard him saying that.

00:45:58.293 --> 00:46:02.023
I was sure about whom he was referring to.

00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:04.362
I thought I would miss my chance to talk to her again.

00:46:04.363 --> 00:46:06.833
I didn't want anyone to interrupt...

00:46:07.093 --> 00:46:09.632
while I was talking to Bon Hee,

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:12.402
so I went to Mu Jin to talk to him.

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:14.303
(Surprised)

00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:16.772
- That'll clearly help.
- Yes, that's a good idea.

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.842
He'll ask Mu Jin not to interrupt when he talks to Bon Hee.

00:46:18.843 --> 00:46:20.012
He's so decisive.

00:46:20.013 --> 00:46:22.773
(He'll prevent all the distractions for a conversation with Bon Hee.)

00:46:24.243 --> 00:46:25.853
This is where I rest.

00:46:26.913 --> 00:46:28.783
- No one else must use this place.
- Right.

00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:33.092
Is there no camera in there?

00:46:33.093 --> 00:46:34.813
- I think so.
- There's no camera in there.

00:46:34.923 --> 00:46:36.063
Well...

00:46:36.123 --> 00:46:39.063
(Sang Hyeon can't start talking easily.)

00:46:39.993 --> 00:46:41.593
What I want to tell you is...

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:43.833
Well...

00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:46.573
Don't get me wrong.

00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:52.173
I was fond of Bon Hee from the get-go.

00:46:52.473 --> 00:46:55.683
But I saw that you were always around her.

00:46:56.443 --> 00:47:00.913
I would also like to talk to her.

00:47:01.483 --> 00:47:02.582
- I see.
- So I'm asking you...

00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:04.953
to give me some time to talk to her.

00:47:05.493 --> 00:47:07.253
- Goodness, you.
- That's my honest feeling.

00:47:08.423 --> 00:47:09.992
You don't have to ask for my permission.

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.523
I know, but still...

00:47:11.623 --> 00:47:13.932
But I really don't care at all.

00:47:13.933 --> 00:47:15.603
And we're all here to do so.

00:47:16.863 --> 00:47:18.733
- That's true, but...
- We're here for that.

00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:22.672
I don't know how Bon Hee feels.

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.973
But I just do as my heart says.

00:47:25.043 --> 00:47:26.843
I just follow my heart.

00:47:26.943 --> 00:47:28.312
You don't have to worry about me.

00:47:28.313 --> 00:47:30.082
You can do whatever you want.

00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:31.143
My, that's cool.

00:47:31.283 --> 00:47:33.912
Then I'll go and talk to her.

00:47:33.913 --> 00:47:34.953
All right.

00:47:38.353 --> 00:47:41.292
Sang Hyeon kept it simple and nice. I'm glad he talked to Mu Jin.

00:47:41.293 --> 00:47:44.263
(Sang Hyeon goes straight to the older women's room.)

00:47:44.793 --> 00:47:46.032
(Knocking)

00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:47.033
Come in.

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.402
You're all gathered here?

00:47:50.403 --> 00:47:51.403
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:47:52.033 --> 00:47:55.703
(All the older women are looking at Sang Hyeon.)

00:47:56.603 --> 00:47:58.612
Bon Hee, can I talk to you briefly?

00:47:58.613 --> 00:47:59.673
Oh, sure. Yes.

00:48:00.413 --> 00:48:01.442
He's cool.

00:48:01.443 --> 00:48:03.082
I think he made up his mind.

00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:04.182
He should be like this.

00:48:04.183 --> 00:48:05.512
(Smiling, surprised)

00:48:05.513 --> 00:48:06.613
(Surprised)

00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:08.053
I'm surprised.

00:48:08.723 --> 00:48:10.123
I feel bad for So Hyun.

00:48:11.453 --> 00:48:13.453
"What? He didn't come to see me."

00:48:14.153 --> 00:48:17.593
I realized that he wasn't interested in me.

00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:24.903
(Mu Jin comes back to his room after talking to Sang Hyeon.)

00:48:25.573 --> 00:48:29.272
Although Mu Jin nonchalantly said he didn't care,

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:32.112
- it must bother him.
- It must bother him so much.

00:48:32.113 --> 00:48:34.153
(Does the conversation with Sang Hyeon bother him?)

00:48:34.913 --> 00:48:39.713
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon come out to the terrace.)

00:48:42.583 --> 00:48:43.653
There's one pair here.

00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:46.253
- Thank you.
- It's still a little bit wet here.

00:48:47.523 --> 00:48:49.222
- Did you catch your breath?
- Yes.

00:48:49.223 --> 00:48:51.123
- Shall I sit here?
- Yes, please.

00:48:54.493 --> 00:48:56.932
Actually, before I came to you,

00:48:56.933 --> 00:49:00.573
- I talked to Mu Jin briefly.
- Okay.

00:49:01.133 --> 00:49:04.873
I said I liked you the most based on the first impression.

00:49:05.573 --> 00:49:08.212
And that you were the only one I was interested in romantically,

00:49:08.213 --> 00:49:09.382
and so I wanted to talk to you.

00:49:09.383 --> 00:49:11.542
But I didn't have a chance to talk to you.

00:49:11.543 --> 00:49:15.452
Also, it's hard to approach you because he's always around you.

00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:18.792
So I asked him to give me a chance to talk to you if he didn't mind.

00:49:18.793 --> 00:49:19.923
That's what I told him.

00:49:20.823 --> 00:49:23.993
It was quite hard for me to say that to Mu Jin.

00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:26.933
But I really wanted to talk to you.

00:49:28.193 --> 00:49:31.563
(Hesitating)

00:49:32.673 --> 00:49:34.503
To be honest, here's what I thought.

00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:37.142
It's hard not to notice...

00:49:37.143 --> 00:49:38.613
how Mu Jin takes care of you...

00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:42.083
and how you take care of him.

00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:44.713
Watching you two doing so...

00:49:45.153 --> 00:49:47.683
made me realize that you two were already...

00:49:47.783 --> 00:49:50.523
into each other so deeply.

00:49:51.253 --> 00:49:54.523
Watching you two together made me feel...

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.262
miserable.

00:49:57.263 --> 00:49:59.432
It hurt my feelings every time,

00:49:59.433 --> 00:50:00.962
which made me unconfident and timid.

00:50:00.963 --> 00:50:02.002
(Wounds have piled up in his heart.)

00:50:02.003 --> 00:50:03.123
He's telling her everything.

00:50:03.763 --> 00:50:06.203
(A few hours earlier, after the 3-Minute Match...)

00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:09.873
(Bon Hee took care of Mu Jin.)

00:50:10.103 --> 00:50:13.072
After the game, she came up to him...

00:50:13.073 --> 00:50:16.112
and had a chat with him, which I obviously saw.

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:18.313
(Sang Hyeon had a lot on his mind while watching them.)

00:50:18.753 --> 00:50:21.713
(The night before, when everyone gathered, )

00:50:21.813 --> 00:50:25.753
(she didn't take the cushion that Sang Hyeon offered.)

00:50:26.553 --> 00:50:28.453
It was so easy to tell...

00:50:29.063 --> 00:50:30.792
that the feelings were mutual.

00:50:30.793 --> 00:50:32.353
(Sang Hyeon felt that they were solid.)

00:50:33.693 --> 00:50:34.863
Oh, I see.

00:50:38.263 --> 00:50:40.472
I thought that if I approached you aggressively...

00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:42.673
just because you were the only one I was interested in,

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:45.843
it would be nothing less than sabotaging your relationship.

00:50:52.683 --> 00:50:58.083
If you're more sure about Mu Jin than you are about me...

00:51:01.753 --> 00:51:02.763
Oh, my.

00:51:05.933 --> 00:51:10.062
I think I should give up on you. That thought got bigger...

00:51:10.063 --> 00:51:11.163
as time went by.

00:51:14.473 --> 00:51:17.203
That's why I decided to talk to you.

00:51:18.673 --> 00:51:22.042
I did become serious about this after you first came to talk to me.

00:51:22.043 --> 00:51:26.213
I was just relaxed on the 1st and 2nd days.

00:51:26.853 --> 00:51:29.323
But I realized that...

00:51:30.023 --> 00:51:32.723
it could be more emotionally exhausting than I expected.

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.623
And that surprised me.

00:51:35.623 --> 00:51:38.732
Also, I found it so great of you to pluck up the courage...

00:51:38.733 --> 00:51:40.763
and told me how you felt that day.

00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:43.663
I found you to be a very brave man.

00:51:44.703 --> 00:51:45.973
But it's too soon to say...

00:51:46.273 --> 00:51:49.343
I admit that I'm interested in him,

00:51:50.803 --> 00:51:53.773
but it's not that there's no room in my heart for anyone else.

00:51:53.943 --> 00:51:56.212
I mean, it's been only four days.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.443
Exactly.

00:51:58.043 --> 00:51:59.613
That's how I feel right now.

00:52:00.853 --> 00:52:05.693
(Sang Hyeon finally smiles after the honest conversation.)

00:52:12.133 --> 00:52:14.833
If I ever made you uncomfortable...

00:52:18.003 --> 00:52:20.402
- No, that's okay.
- I'm simply sorry.

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:21.703
Don't say that.

00:52:23.043 --> 00:52:25.742
After hearing what Sang Hyeon had to say,

00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:28.072
I felt like my heart ached for him...

00:52:28.073 --> 00:52:29.583
because of how he had felt.

00:52:29.943 --> 00:52:31.583
I mean, it must have seemed to him...

00:52:31.683 --> 00:52:33.913
like I was already into someone else,

00:52:34.483 --> 00:52:36.522
so he must've worried if he had made me uncomfortable...

00:52:36.523 --> 00:52:39.193
by telling me how he felt about me.

00:52:39.853 --> 00:52:42.062
It seemed very considerate of him...

00:52:42.063 --> 00:52:44.723
from my perspective.

00:52:45.793 --> 00:52:50.003
I hoped it didn't break his heart so much.

00:52:51.133 --> 00:52:54.502
(Weren't you being too considerate?)

00:52:54.503 --> 00:52:56.972
I understand that it can be frustrating.

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:59.972
I feel frustrated too. I'm frustrated with myself sometimes.

00:52:59.973 --> 00:53:02.613
I think I'm too timid.

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.943
And I wonder why.

00:53:06.153 --> 00:53:10.082
But when I showed someone whom I was interested in...

00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:14.093
who I really was, little by little,

00:53:15.053 --> 00:53:16.863
things went well between me and her.

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:20.632
When I met someone who liked that side of me too,

00:53:20.633 --> 00:53:22.433
I was very happy in that relationship.

00:53:25.163 --> 00:53:27.473
That's who I am.

00:53:28.603 --> 00:53:30.673
- Let's go up.
- Shall we?

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.643
Sang Hyeon is...

00:53:35.613 --> 00:53:38.412
- very serious about this.
- He's immersed in it.

00:53:38.413 --> 00:53:40.783
- It's so easy to see that.
- That's right.

00:53:41.153 --> 00:53:42.823
It must've required a lot of courage.

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.253
And it must've hurt his pride a little bit.

00:53:46.853 --> 00:53:50.963
He was whining to ask her to notice his feelings for her.

00:53:51.263 --> 00:53:52.939
- He was whining?
- He wasn't complaining though.

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:55.733
That's because he had no other choice.

00:53:56.063 --> 00:53:59.172
Mu Jin and Bon Hee seemed like a sturdy wall...

00:53:59.173 --> 00:54:01.472
- that wouldn't fall down.
- Right.

00:54:01.473 --> 00:54:04.272
So he decided to hit the wall...

00:54:04.273 --> 00:54:06.512
using his entire body.

00:54:06.513 --> 00:54:08.442
He decided to do that, at least.

00:54:08.443 --> 00:54:10.963
(Sang Hyeon made every effort to express his feelings for her.)

00:54:11.343 --> 00:54:12.553
(Sighing)

00:54:17.953 --> 00:54:19.623
(He spots Sang Hyeon.)

00:54:21.393 --> 00:54:24.723
(The two of them pass each other by without saying anything.)

00:54:34.073 --> 00:54:36.903
(Sighing)

00:54:40.673 --> 00:54:41.773
Aren't you hungry?

00:54:42.713 --> 00:54:44.183
Can't we start cooking kimchi stew?

00:54:44.243 --> 00:54:45.783
We don't have the ingredients yet.

00:54:46.853 --> 00:54:47.853
Is it done?

00:54:47.854 --> 00:54:48.982
- Do we just have to set the table?
- We just have to wait.

00:54:48.983 --> 00:54:50.382
We have to keep boiling it for 10 or 20 minutes.

00:54:50.383 --> 00:54:52.063
- It's too easy.
- What else will we have?

00:54:53.153 --> 00:54:54.852
I took out pork neck, so we could grill it.

00:54:54.853 --> 00:54:57.163
- We can also have ramyeon.
- Han River ramyeon?

00:54:57.623 --> 00:54:58.992
I didn't see Han River ramyeon.

00:54:58.993 --> 00:55:01.233
(Bothered)

00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:05.603
(Is he flirting in the way INFPs flirt?)

00:55:05.873 --> 00:55:07.472
- I took it out.
- We can also have ramyeon.

00:55:07.473 --> 00:55:08.773
Han River ramyeon?

00:55:08.973 --> 00:55:12.773
(Mu Jin brings a chair right away.)

00:55:13.573 --> 00:55:16.082
- Think of Han River ramyeon.
- Should I? I couldn't think of it.

00:55:16.083 --> 00:55:17.813
(He puts his chair right next to Bon Hee.)

00:55:18.283 --> 00:55:20.112
(Looking around nervously)

00:55:20.113 --> 00:55:21.982
Ji Yung is good at making rolled omelet.

00:55:21.983 --> 00:55:23.152
(Mu Jin sits next to Bon Hee naturally.)

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.253
Rolled omelet?

00:55:25.153 --> 00:55:26.622
That would make it like Japanese cuisine.

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.753
It would taste great if you add some seasoning.

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:30.723
Aren't you hungry?

00:55:31.863 --> 00:55:34.793
I've been so out of it, so I'm not so hungry right now.

00:55:35.133 --> 00:55:36.862
And I ate so much of kimchi fried rice earlier.

00:55:36.863 --> 00:55:38.223
- I see.
- It should be all right.

00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:51.583
(Their feelings are entangled at Yeon House this evening.)

00:55:52.283 --> 00:55:54.553
- This place is so nice.
- It's beautiful.

00:55:54.953 --> 00:55:56.113
There's a swimming pool here.

00:55:56.683 --> 00:55:59.153
They decorated the walls with bows.

00:55:59.623 --> 00:56:01.123
It's beautiful.

00:56:02.193 --> 00:56:03.923
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

00:56:06.193 --> 00:56:08.493
- It looks good.
- It looks really tasty.

00:56:10.403 --> 00:56:13.103
- Let's eat.
- Can we eat it right now?

00:56:15.203 --> 00:56:17.943
You can sit and relax. I'll cook these deliciously.

00:56:19.713 --> 00:56:21.573
It will be so tasty.

00:56:22.783 --> 00:56:23.842
This looks so good.

00:56:23.843 --> 00:56:25.723
(Chicken stir fry is being cooked deliciously.)

00:56:26.553 --> 00:56:28.713
- Should we reduce the heat?
- Yes, we should do that.

00:56:30.583 --> 00:56:33.022
- Three, maybe. It's almost done.
- Three?

00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:35.023
What? Already?

00:56:35.093 --> 00:56:37.192
It's good even when it's barely cooked.

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.293
No.

00:56:38.933 --> 00:56:40.633
I don't want to get a stomachache.

00:56:42.863 --> 00:56:45.602
How should I say this? Are you the type...

00:56:45.603 --> 00:56:47.672
that doesn't get sick from eating undercooked food?

00:56:47.673 --> 00:56:48.873
- Me? Yes.
- I knew it.

00:56:48.903 --> 00:56:50.573
You're the really healthy type.

00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:52.943
I don't get sick often.

00:56:54.373 --> 00:56:55.612
I think we can have alcohol.

00:56:55.613 --> 00:56:56.742
- Really?
- Yes.

00:56:56.743 --> 00:56:57.913
Shall we have some, then?

00:56:58.513 --> 00:56:59.513
(Exclaiming)

00:56:59.514 --> 00:57:00.612
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

00:57:00.613 --> 00:57:01.613
Really?

00:57:04.783 --> 00:57:05.793
(Surprised)

00:57:05.953 --> 00:57:07.723
- It's delicious!
- It's really delicious.

00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.493
(Proud)

00:57:14.463 --> 00:57:16.703
By the way, out of the three exercises,

00:57:16.963 --> 00:57:18.503
which one was the toughest?

00:57:18.703 --> 00:57:20.003
- Chin-ups.
- This one?

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:22.133
Is that normally the hardest one?

00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:24.073
It's not really that.

00:57:24.343 --> 00:57:27.743
If you weigh more, you're at a disadvantage, for sure.

00:57:29.643 --> 00:57:32.213
I tried really hard. For real.

00:57:32.383 --> 00:57:33.753
That's the truth.

00:57:34.153 --> 00:57:36.153
So, after the morning date,

00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:39.553
I was thinking, "That was my last date for the day."

00:57:40.053 --> 00:57:41.852
- Did you think we would all...
- Today,

00:57:41.853 --> 00:57:43.223
we ate as a group of six.

00:57:44.593 --> 00:57:47.493
But I wanted to talk to you more,

00:57:49.003 --> 00:57:51.302
so I was wondering, "Do I have to wait until tomorrow?" But then...

00:57:51.303 --> 00:57:52.703
I thought it was my birthday today.

00:57:52.903 --> 00:57:53.972
Did you hear that?

00:57:53.973 --> 00:57:56.002
- He thought it was his birthday.
- What an expression.

00:57:56.003 --> 00:57:57.502
- He's good at sweet-talking.
- All right.

00:57:57.503 --> 00:57:58.872
All right. Write that down now.

00:57:58.873 --> 00:58:00.319
- He knows how to flirt.
- "I thought it was my birthday."

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:02.242
- He sure knows how to flatter.
- That kind of expression...

00:58:02.243 --> 00:58:03.982
only comes from sincerity.

00:58:03.983 --> 00:58:05.312
- Yes.
- That's nice.

00:58:05.313 --> 00:58:07.653
I think that's the charm of a younger guy.

00:58:08.213 --> 00:58:09.623
I thought it was my birthday today.

00:58:10.083 --> 00:58:12.023
And the event just happened to be...

00:58:12.523 --> 00:58:14.492
It was perfect for you.

00:58:14.493 --> 00:58:15.593
Perfect for me.

00:58:16.263 --> 00:58:17.562
(For Ji Yung, today was like a birthday present.)

00:58:17.563 --> 00:58:18.863
I was so happy.

00:58:19.233 --> 00:58:21.532
Goodness, it even felt like your birthday?

00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:23.103
(Chuckling)

00:58:25.903 --> 00:58:27.473
Can I ask who you chose yesterday?

00:58:27.703 --> 00:58:30.443
Did you send it to the person you wanted to talk to the most?

00:58:31.003 --> 00:58:33.472
Did you just ask who I chose yesterday?

00:58:33.473 --> 00:58:34.473
Yes.

00:58:34.474 --> 00:58:36.114
- Who did I choose?
- Who did you choose?

00:58:36.543 --> 00:58:37.983
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Yes.

00:58:38.013 --> 00:58:40.283
- Well...
- Tell me who you chose first.

00:58:40.453 --> 00:58:41.582
- Me?
- Yes.

00:58:41.583 --> 00:58:42.583
He's in trouble.

00:58:42.584 --> 00:58:43.682
Now that you put it like that,

00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:44.783
- I can't say it.
- See?

00:58:45.923 --> 00:58:47.423
I can tell you, though.

00:58:47.853 --> 00:58:50.922
There was someone I wanted to talk to more.

00:58:50.923 --> 00:58:52.533
- Oh, really? There was just one?
- Yes.

00:58:52.993 --> 00:58:55.193
Yes. There was one person.

00:58:55.433 --> 00:58:56.803
So, who did you choose?

00:58:56.903 --> 00:58:58.003
(Laughing)

00:58:58.103 --> 00:58:59.532
- You go first. Yes?
- I brought it up myself,

00:58:59.533 --> 00:59:02.009
- but I'm regretting it now.
- You're regretting it, aren't you?

00:59:02.033 --> 00:59:03.373
I think I made a mistake.

00:59:04.873 --> 00:59:06.073
Who would you have chosen?

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:08.213
I'm curious who you chose.

00:59:08.443 --> 00:59:09.612
Don't say it, both of you.

00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:11.083
Then, yesterday,

00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:13.412
people voted for each other...

00:59:13.413 --> 00:59:15.329
- and checked each other's, right?
- That's right.

00:59:15.353 --> 00:59:16.623
How many votes did you get?

00:59:17.783 --> 00:59:18.953
I got one.

00:59:19.753 --> 00:59:21.252
But here's what's fascinating about the guys.

00:59:21.253 --> 00:59:23.299
Am I allowed to say this? Is this too big a spoiler?

00:59:23.323 --> 00:59:24.492
Did everyone get one vote each?

00:59:24.493 --> 00:59:26.093
I think so, based on our conversation.

00:59:28.933 --> 00:59:31.002
(She found out that only she sent Sang Hyeon a Love QR Code.)

00:59:31.003 --> 00:59:32.163
That is fascinating.

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:34.973
Then, she might find a bit more courage...

00:59:35.433 --> 00:59:36.993
since she doesn't have any competitors.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.443
This place is so nice, by the way.

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.843
- Then, let's change into swimsuits.
- Yes?

00:59:45.513 --> 00:59:47.753
Let's change into swimsuits and show me your skills.

00:59:50.823 --> 00:59:53.452
(Ji Yung changed into his swimsuit.)

00:59:53.453 --> 00:59:55.123
He has a great build.

00:59:56.393 --> 00:59:57.693
Ji Yung is seriously...

00:59:57.993 --> 01:00:00.563
Rugby players are just built differently.

01:00:01.263 --> 01:00:04.202
I mean, his body looks like it's four-dimensional.

01:00:04.203 --> 01:00:07.102
I think... It's only been a day since So Hyun arrived.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.702
How can he appear shirtless in a single day?

01:00:08.703 --> 01:00:11.542
Well, I'm guessing that Ji Yung thought...

01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:13.013
that was his charming point.

01:00:14.643 --> 01:00:15.912
- Is the water warm?
- Yes.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.882
- Since the water is warm...
- Are you really not cold?

01:00:17.883 --> 01:00:21.413
I'm okay now since I have a towel around me.

01:00:23.883 --> 01:00:25.223
- Is it warm?
- Oh, my.

01:00:25.523 --> 01:00:27.093
- Is it warm?
- This is so nice.

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.663
- It's warm.
- It's so warm.

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:32.833
It's really warm.

01:00:38.633 --> 01:00:41.273
Out of all the places you went swimming, which place was the best?

01:00:42.543 --> 01:00:45.573
The sea in Australia is really beautiful. There...

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:46.973
Who did you hang out with?

01:00:47.613 --> 01:00:48.673
- Me?
- Yes.

01:00:49.243 --> 01:00:50.342
That's a secret.

01:00:50.343 --> 01:00:52.043
(Smiling)

01:00:52.183 --> 01:00:53.852
- What do you mean it's a secret?
- By myself.

01:00:53.853 --> 01:00:55.533
- You had fun by yourself.
- That's right.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.352
Yes, you had fun by yourself.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.193
(Slightly taken aback)

01:00:59.653 --> 01:01:02.893
It's kind of cute when you get flustered.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.062
- I'm usually not like this.
- Oh, really?

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.793
- I'm literally going crazy.
- Really?

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:10.503
Normally, I just...

01:01:11.163 --> 01:01:14.573
say what I want to say honestly.

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:18.072
I'm not sure why I'm doing this.

01:01:18.073 --> 01:01:19.313
I keep behaving awkwardly.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.473
Are you maybe nervous?

01:01:24.283 --> 01:01:25.512
- A bit?
- Oh, a bit.

01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:26.513
A bit.

01:01:27.213 --> 01:01:28.913
I'm sure that can happen.

01:01:28.983 --> 01:01:30.383
I usually don't get nervous at all.

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:33.452
"How cute would I seem to her?"

01:01:33.453 --> 01:01:34.823
I suddenly had that thought.

01:01:35.093 --> 01:01:38.093
Normally, I would've flirted with her as I found her cute,

01:01:38.623 --> 01:01:41.593
but it seemed like she found me way too cute instead.

01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:43.463
But this is so...

01:01:44.763 --> 01:01:47.233
It didn't feel all that great.

01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:50.773
But this is a first for me.

01:01:51.103 --> 01:01:53.613
I didn't know how to behave.

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.803
That's cute. I see he has that kind of charm too.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:59.083
(Stay calm.)

01:01:59.953 --> 01:02:01.753
Do you like guys with nice bodies?

01:02:02.383 --> 01:02:03.753
Someone with a nice body?

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:04.853
(Getting his hopes up)

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.453
A man with a nice body?

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:10.063
To be honest, my personal taste...

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.422
Rather than big muscles,

01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:14.332
- Like lean muscles?
- I like slim but fit muscles.

01:02:14.333 --> 01:02:15.532
I prefer more slender...

01:02:15.533 --> 01:02:16.732
Someone who looks good in most outfits.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.202
That's right.

01:02:18.203 --> 01:02:19.373
That's not me, then.

01:02:20.273 --> 01:02:23.103
- That's just my personal taste.
- Okay.

01:02:24.503 --> 01:02:27.113
(Disappointed)

01:02:28.113 --> 01:02:31.583
But So Hyun... Even though he took his shirt off,

01:02:31.683 --> 01:02:35.353
she said, "I like a man with lean muscles."

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:39.183
If she liked Ji Yung, she wouldn't have said that.

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.752
She could've said, "I don't really care about that."

01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:45.322
Or maybe like, "I like guys with bigger muscles."

01:02:45.323 --> 01:02:46.923
- She would've said that.
- That's true.

01:02:46.993 --> 01:02:49.802
Also, he said, "As for the men,"

01:02:49.803 --> 01:02:52.562
"I think we each got one vote."

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:54.033
That's what he said earlier.

01:02:55.133 --> 01:02:56.373
He's totally unaware.

01:02:57.103 --> 01:02:59.973
But on this date, that actually became...

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:02.472
the thing that made So Hyun...

01:03:02.473 --> 01:03:04.843
yearn for Sang Hyeon even more.

01:03:05.283 --> 01:03:07.512
"What's this? I don't have any competitors."

01:03:07.513 --> 01:03:09.582
"Okay! He only got my vote!"

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:11.153
That's what this turned into.

01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:13.493
"Okay!" That's how things went.

01:03:13.893 --> 01:03:15.322
- Are you still cold?
- Yes.

01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:17.062
- I'll try to find...
- I don't think I want to eat,

01:03:17.063 --> 01:03:18.093
but I'm not sure.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:22.033
- It's quiet.
- Hello.

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.963
Hello.

01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:27.802
- Why are you back so late?
- How far did you guys go?

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:30.173
- You look like you drank a lot.
- You look tired.

01:03:31.303 --> 01:03:32.673
Do I seem like I had drinks?

01:03:35.613 --> 01:03:38.442
(So Hyun goes upstairs, and Ji Yung follows her.)

01:03:38.443 --> 01:03:39.852
You've had a long day.

01:03:39.853 --> 01:03:41.652
(Ji Yung follows her as well as Sang Hyeon.)

01:03:41.653 --> 01:03:43.853
Hang on. Sang Hyeon is right on his tail.

01:03:44.953 --> 01:03:46.223
What were you guys doing?

01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:48.453
- Who? Us?
- Yes.

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:51.522
We got some sleep and talked a bit too.

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:53.662
- And you guys ate?
- By the way, your outfit is pretty.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.032
- Oh, really?
- It's so...

01:03:55.033 --> 01:03:57.202
It's subtle, but it's beautiful.

01:03:57.203 --> 01:03:59.302
- It sure is different.
- Yes, it's somehow...

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.402
Thank you.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.742
Is that jacket "one size fits all?" For men and women?

01:04:02.743 --> 01:04:04.902
This? I don't know. Do you want to try it on?

01:04:04.903 --> 01:04:06.913
No, I wasn't trying to borrow your clothes.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.813
- Oh, you should get some rest.
- Okay.

01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:13.712
- Bon Hee.
- Yes?

01:04:13.713 --> 01:04:15.112
She became happier just now.

01:04:15.113 --> 01:04:16.622
It's because Sang Hyeon complimented her.

01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:18.183
- Was it fun? How was it?
- Well,

01:04:18.653 --> 01:04:20.223
it was fun, but...

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.462
I can tell you, right?

01:04:23.463 --> 01:04:24.522
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:29.333
I think I like someone else.

01:04:30.063 --> 01:04:31.632
Oh, no!

01:04:31.633 --> 01:04:33.572
- He just has a good personality, - I feel so bad for Ji Yung.

01:04:33.573 --> 01:04:35.273
- so I did have fun.
- Right.

01:04:35.473 --> 01:04:36.702
But...

01:04:36.703 --> 01:04:39.373
I didn't feel really giddy or happy.

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:42.443
- It was just pleasant.
- So, it was pleasant.

01:04:43.743 --> 01:04:45.812
(Ji Yung is talking to Hyeon Jun too.)

01:04:45.813 --> 01:04:47.183
Until this point in my life,

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.852
I don't think I've talked to anyone else who was this...

01:04:51.853 --> 01:04:53.853
- Easy to talk to?
- That's how it felt earlier.

01:04:54.093 --> 01:04:58.423
It felt like she was catering to me on purpose.

01:04:58.763 --> 01:05:01.293
She was so comfortable and nice.

01:05:02.693 --> 01:05:03.803
She was so nice.

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.603
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Oh, no.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.002
- You did great.
- I know.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.233
This is bad. What do we do?

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.302
- So, can I ask you something?
- About what?

01:05:12.303 --> 01:05:14.043
Is there someone you like?

01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:17.343
- Can I ask you?
- I think I like Mu Jin.

01:05:17.883 --> 01:05:18.943
Oh, really?

01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:20.553
I like...

01:05:21.953 --> 01:05:23.023
Sang Hyeon.

01:05:23.523 --> 01:05:24.623
Oh, really?

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:26.953
But the thing is,

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:30.262
I want to keep talking to him,

01:05:30.263 --> 01:05:31.893
but I never get the chance to do so.

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:39.203
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon is talking on the terrace.)

01:05:41.273 --> 01:05:44.002
(After meticulously checking her appearance, )

01:05:44.003 --> 01:05:45.642
I'll be back.

01:05:45.643 --> 01:05:47.773
(So Hyun leaves the room.)

01:05:48.473 --> 01:05:52.142
(Then, she heads to the terrace.)

01:05:52.143 --> 01:05:53.883
It must be a ten, not a hundred.

01:05:54.883 --> 01:05:56.423
(Hiding)

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:59.693
(She hides herself after seeing so many people.)

01:06:00.293 --> 01:06:02.552
(Peeking)

01:06:02.553 --> 01:06:03.992
(Do you want me to get Sang Hyeon?)

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:04.993
(Nodding)

01:06:05.075 --> 01:06:08.744
(Then, she heads to the terrace.)

01:06:08.745 --> 01:06:10.085
It must be a ten, not a hundred.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.580
(Hiding)

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.850
(She hides herself after seeing so many people.)

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.589
(Peeking)

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.989
(Do you want me to get Sang Hyeon?)

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:21.360
(Nodding)

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.130
(Communicating with her head)

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.460
(Tapping)

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.460
(She's asking for you.)

01:06:28.461 --> 01:06:29.629
(Getting right up)

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:30.899
It's a good thing Ji Yung isn't there.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.440
(Thanks to Hyeon Jun, So Hyun gets Sang Hyeon's attention.)

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.110
(Turning around)

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.940
Yeong Gyeong is also kind of interested in Sang Hyeon.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.880
(Why isn't he coming?)

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:47.850
What? Why?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.589
- Can he not open the door?
- Is the door maybe locked?

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.889
(Sang Hyeon is struggling with the door.)

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.089
It won't open.

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:54.990
- He's taking the door off.
- Oh, I got it.

01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:58.800
- Shall we talk for a bit?
- Pardon?

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:01.260
- Let's talk.
- Oh, okay.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.969
Shall we talk on the first floor?

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.999
- Oh, you mean talk about us?
- Yes.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.499
I thought someone else was asking for me.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.539
- Oh, no.
- Then,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.540
shall we go somewhere else like the second floor?

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:17.310
(They end up coming up to the men's floor.)

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.419
Oh, wait.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.150
(Backing up)

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:23.920
Let me close the door.

01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:26.420
Come this way.

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:27.719
Where?

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.080
(Sang Hyeon leads her to the terrace in front of his room.)

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.959
Oh, there's a place like this?

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.999
It's where I secretly work out.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.169
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:37.330
This is nice.

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:39.539
- Her energy is totally different.
- Right.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.569
Her voice has gotten higher. "This is nice."

01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:43.130
She didn't say stuff like that earlier.

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.410
- Did you enjoy your evening?
- Yes, I did.

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.549
- I had chicken stir fry today.
- Really?

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.249
I thought you'd have grilled meat.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.049
Well, there was meat,

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:56.589
but I wanted chicken more, so we had chicken stir fry.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:57.849
Was it good?

01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:58.959
It was.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.260
What about the person?

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.189
- The person?
- The person you went with.

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.359
The person I went with?

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.299
Did you talk a lot with the person you went with?

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.870
Well, we talked a lot since we were...

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:11.770
together the whole time.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:16.209
But I... Earlier,

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.510
when you guys exercised for the mission,

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.539
- I was rooting for you.
- Oh, me?

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.809
- Yes, I rooted for you.
- Really?

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.290
And I thought, "I hope he does well,"

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.489
"so we can go on a date together." Well, you might not have picked me.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:33.519
- Oh, right.
- But that was what I was thinking.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520
(So Hyun carefully expresses her feelings.)

01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:39.199
So, I wanted to talk to you.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.999
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, really?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.030
Yes.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.729
(Sighing)

01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.470
- Goodness, let me catch my breath.
- Why?

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.010
I gave you water first too.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.780
Oh, did you?

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.279
But I was only thinking of...

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.979
giving the water to those behind me quickly.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.450
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.819
(So Hyun went to Sang Hyeon as soon as the game ended.)

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.989
(However, )

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:08.320
(that bottle of water went straight to Hyeon Jun.)

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.329
- I made sure to give you water.
- Really?

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:12.399
If I also gave you a towel,

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.029
I thought it would've been too obvious.

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.160
Oh, really?

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.700
Gosh, I had no idea.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.300
Anyway, that's how I felt.

01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:27.979
- I'm not really sure at this point, - Sure.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.079
- but what I felt at first...
- Yes?

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.579
Was that you were very calm...

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:37.650
and that you had the vibe of someone with a good heart.

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:40.420
I was thinking that.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.629
I had less time than the others,

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:45.800
and those who have seen you longer kept talking about that...

01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:48.200
when we were all together.

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:49.999
- Oh, okay.
- So, I thought,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.070
"My judgment was right."

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.700
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.840
"Is that so?" I was thinking that as well.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.409
"I kind of want to talk to him."

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.110
That was on my mind.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:08.180
By the way,

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.049
I never thought you'd approach me like this.

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:13.260
- Really?
- No, not at all.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.129
If I'm to be totally honest,

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:19.160
- when we were... When you entered, - Yes?

01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:21.199
- I didn't really think much of it.
- Okay.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.930
I just thought, "She's here."

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.369
"She looks like an actress. She has a beautiful face."

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:29.140
That's all I thought about, not anything beyond that.

01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:30.870
She must be disappointed.

01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:32.909
He didn't have the time for it.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:36.279
I actually had someone else in mind from the beginning.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.310
I mean, I don't know if you guessed that.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.650
So, I just had a headache from dealing with that.

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:46.119
(I see.)

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.490
But anyway,

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:51.060
I will always keep you in mind.

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:55.869
Whatever it is, no matter what I choose,

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.229
I will at least do so with you in mind.

01:10:58.230 --> 01:10:59.439
That's something I can also...

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.276
(Sang Hyeon tries to consider So Hyun who was courageous.)

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.870
Since it happened out of the blue, I was really bewildered.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.409
The fact that someone was rooting for me...

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:10.280
was quite fascinating.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.349
I found out how the other person feels,

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.980
and he said he was grateful that I approached him.

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.390
So, for now, I think it's a green light.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.960
Right. You have to express yourself like that.

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.190
Yes, you have to express yourself no matter what.

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:26.899
I felt bad for him before,

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.999
but because So Hyun came into the picture,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.900
his face seems to be lighting up again.

01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:34.269
It was so nice...

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.240
- that I can watch them lighting up.
- That's right.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.739
Well, the other women...

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.479
have said that they were interested in Sang Hyeon too,

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.909
but I don't think anyone directly expressed it.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:46.219
- You're right. No one did.
- Right.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.389
But So Hyun was the first to say...

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:50.649
- that she was rooting for him.
- Yes.

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:51.989
Don't you think that was a huge confidence booster?

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.459
Actually, he was really fighting a lonely fight.

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.889
- Right.
- Hearing that someone...

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:57.189
was rooting for him...

01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:58.689
must've been a huge comfort.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:01.929
You know, SOOBIN has this low...

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.599
and even tone of voice as he speaks nonchalantly,

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.499
but there are very harsh hidden meanings in his words.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.870
(SOOBIN's harsh manner of speech)

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.239
Sang Hyeon might not realize it,

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.709
but he probably won't look at So Hyun the same way.

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:13.979
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.980
(Will there be any changes in Sang Hyeon's heart?)

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.150
(While Sang Hyeon and So Hyun are talking, )

01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:22.080
(Ji Yung happens to come looking for So Hyun.)

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.890
(Quietly walking over)

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.260
(He finds So Hyun talking to Sang Hyeon.)

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.400
(Ji Yung's night goes by with complicated feelings.)

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.659
- Me too.
- Then, shall we talk?

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.470
(And...)

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:42.940
(Sang Won starts to approach Ji Won.)

01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:45.269
- But there's no mirror there.
- Right.

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:46.279
And without a phone,

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.840
- I had nothing to do.
- That's right.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.520
(It bothers Ye Eun that Sang Won and Ji Won have grown closer.)

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:55.920
- Are you curious about anyone else?
- Someone I'm curious about?

01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:00.920
(I can't say it now.)

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.090
(The night at Yeon House is tangled up with complicated emotions.)

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.330
(The women are getting ready for their dates.)

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:11.129
(They seem to care a lot more today.)

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:14.369
(Today, it's a memory date with the women.)

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:19.980
(Put a memorable photo in the drawer of the younger man you like.)

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.010
(Who is the man that the women want to share their memories with?)

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.700
(I think there was a good sense of nervousness.)

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:31.820
(She might be the one I was looking for.)

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.260
(I want to go with you.)

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.030
Does she like me?

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.159
I like this so much.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.900
I think I'll really remember this.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:45.430
(With an added sweet scent, the date feels even more exciting.)

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.140
(A day filled with new memories)

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.670
(It makes their feelings grow deeper.)

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:53.440
(That night)

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.040
How is Sang Won?

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.279
- I'd like to...
- Get to know him more?

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.850
Get to know him more, I think?

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.350
(A war of nerves between the two women with their eyes on Sang Won)
