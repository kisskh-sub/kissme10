00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.340
In other words,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.230
he's from your orphanage, right?

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.520
Does he know about this, too?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
Yes.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.900
He left the orphanage at six,
so he should have some memory.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.710
There was a philanthropist who sponsored

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.250
children being adopted overseas.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.620
The sponsor's name is...

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.160
Yes, I know that person.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.590
He's my uncle.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.730
But why did my uncle adopt Iljo?

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.210
Kids who aren't conscious
of being abandoned are easy to adopt,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.010
but at his age, they tend to resist it.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.780
Lee Iljo was the oldest child
in this orphanage.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.650
I think the sponsor just decided to adopt
the last kid.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.130
But I heard that the spouse didn't agree,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.580
so they weren't able to complete
the official procedures.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.570
Seriously...

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.500
Okay.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710
Thank you for checking.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.680
Also, Jeonghan,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.180
there's something I couldn't tell you.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.840
You must think I lied to you.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.700
I said I knew

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.880
that you slept with Seo Jeongin.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.440
I'm telling you I don't mind.
So why are you being like this?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.220
Lee Iljo, you...

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.010
Jeonghan.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.130
Are you okay?

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.350
Yeah.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.490
It's Iljo.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.290
You have a fever.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.990
Am I dreaming?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.660
It feels so real.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.780
Am I going to die?

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.700
Get up and eat the porridge
so you can take your medicine.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.840
Are you Iljo?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.890
Are you really Iljo?

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.310
Is there a fake Iljo?

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.930
It will spill!

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.000
What took you so long?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.480
I've been waiting for you.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.070
Have the porridge first.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.640
No, it's not good.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.190
No.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.430
That's not what I meant.
I mean I can't taste anything.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.860
My nose is blocked.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.740
Take your medicine after you finish.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.920
I'm leaving.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.580
Remember to take your medicine.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.800
No!

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.250
I'm going to just die from this sickness.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.770
Please don't say things like that.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.190
Go if you dare.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.990
Don't go.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.560
Please stay with me.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.560
What if I keep making you suffer?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.140
No one can hurt me.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.780
If Seo Jeongin finds out...

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.710
It's okay.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.220
He was arrested.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.260
What?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.330
For drug trafficking.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.770
Seo Jeonghan, seriously...

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.420
I'll get rid
of all the people who hurt you.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.220
What else do you want me to get rid of?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.650
Lie down and rest.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.160
Come here.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.630
By the way,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.330
why did you suddenly come home?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.570
Because of Suhyo.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.010
What? Jang Suhyo?

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.260
Yes.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.400
Don't you know
that Iljo is being threatened?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.440
Is it really none of your business?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.570
Threatened?

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.310
It has nothing to do with Jeonghan.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.550
Really.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.270
His name came out
of that filthy Seo Jeongin's mouth.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.170
Let's just go, okay?

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.150
Why did you say that?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.710
I told you.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.200
That he didn't know about this.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.660
How can you be so sure?

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.900
The timing was way too coincidental.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.530
When news about that house
being redeveloped started spreading,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.470
Seo Jeonghan started to approach you,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.900
and Seo Jeongin started threatening you.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.380
I know.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.730
I know it has nothing to do with Jeonghan.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.970
If you're that sure,
why did you break up with him?

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.970
And why do you keep refusing
to sell the house?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.940
Because I'm all alone now.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.000
Dad and Jeonghan aren't with me anymore.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.850
If I give up my house,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.870
I'll really be alone.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.050
What about me?

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.440
Am I invisible?

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.600
I'm sorry.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.450
Iljo.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.300
Mm?

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.740
All this time,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.240
you've been living for others.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.140
Live for yourself from now on.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.630
Don't think about others.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.560
Listen to your heart.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.370
Do what you want.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.590
This is what Seo Jeonghan
and I want to see.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.780
What do you want to do the most right now?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.420
I want to be by Jeonghan's side.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.410
Go ahead.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.860
I'm telling you to go find that rascal.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.580
I want to stay by your side.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.280
Did anyone say anything?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.150
I said I'll get rid of them.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.690
Your father...

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.440
Uncle...

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.650
Ah...

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.660
I can't get rid of my dad.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.700
Also,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.640
we're not cousins related by blood,

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.620
so what's wrong?

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.240
How did you...

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.200
Why are you so stupid?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.290
He's not your biological father.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.420
Yet you took care of him for nine years,
wasting your youth.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.150
Seo Jeongin and you
have nothing to do with each other,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.200
so why do you feel like
you owe him

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.430
and let him cuss you out
for being a bastard?

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.490
Saying you understand him?

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.730
How can you laugh?

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.260
Are you an idiot?

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.610
We just have different ways.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.010
The way we love each other.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.050
At that moment,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.480
I understood.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:39.190
The Iljo in front of me
always looked small and pitiful,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.860
but I'm the one

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.860
who's actually small.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.670
Jeongin, no.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.940
I understand Jeongin.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.860
He suddenly lost his dad.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.690
It's understandable that he hates me.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.420
Iljo knows how to feel indebted

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.270
and how to bear the hatred of others.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:19.290
I just wanted to return the love
I received.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.230
Jeonghan.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.000
There's no reason for love.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
There's no price, either.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.180
At least, that's how my love is.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.710
He knows how to be loved

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.470
and love.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.280
He's always honest

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.090
and sincere.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.700
Yes.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.230
I dare not say that I know everything
about Iljo.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.670
The Iljo in front of me

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.090
now looks like an existence that is huge.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.540
He's so pure,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.560
bright,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.630
and beautiful.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.670
I love you.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.300
Me too.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.140
That's it.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.050
Maybe the other name for love

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.510
is fear.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.650
But

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.330
I don't want to hear about you
from other people anymore.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.750
Okay.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.830
I'll tell you everything from now on.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.050
Then tell me.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.980
Is there anyone else I need to get rid of?

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.780
Right.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.200
Your exes?

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.420
I think murderers are a bit...

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.230
What will you do if I become a murderer?

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.410
Will you abandon me and run away?

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.490
Let's run away together forever.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.150
Don't look at me like that.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.400
Why?

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.630
It makes me want to kiss you.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.460
Then just kiss me.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.870
No.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.670
You'll catch my cold.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.780
No.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.770
I've never caught a cold in my life.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.970
I said no.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.090
You'll catch a cold.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.800
Come on.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.210
You're not listening to me again.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.260
Listen to me.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.720
I said you'll catch a cold.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.660
No.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.560
I said no!

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.920
I said no!

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.680
Hey!

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.250
All right.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.100
Iljo.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.660
Get up.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.820
Have some porridge and take medicine.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.260
Why is the porridge angry?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.330
I told you it's contagious
and not to kiss me, didn't I?

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.540
Hey!

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.720
Why?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.330
"I've never caught a cold in my life."

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.780
Gosh.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.010
Here.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.410
How is it?

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.370
It's delicious.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.400
Really?

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.470
Oh.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.430
Here.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.190
It seems I'll have to be the one cooking.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.170
In the future?

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.490
Mm-hmm.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.300
Iljo.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.820
From now on, we don't have to
care about other people anymore.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.380
Let's do whatever we want to do.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.770
What we want to do?

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.960
Yes.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.250
I will make everything come true—

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.030
everything you want to do.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.329
Why?

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.310
What is it?

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.220
Tell me.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.760
Do you want me to buy you a house?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.890
Or a car?

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.500
I want to get a high school diploma.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.090
I want to go to college, too.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.790
I want to find something I'm good at.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.720
Then do it. All of them.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.850
But to do that I need time and money.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.490
Do you think
I can't invest that much in you?

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.810
It'll take a very, very...

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.410
long time.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.480
I know.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.630
College takes four years.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.250
To find what I'm good at

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.350
might take even longer.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.640
Do you have to go this far?

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.480
I want to have it.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.570
I...

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.870
want to have your future.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.710
I know.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.120
-It's all my wishful thinking.
-Take it.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800
My future.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.710
You can have it.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.350
I knew you'd say this.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.610
That's why I didn't tell you.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.700
How can you exchange
your future with me like that?

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.400
Come here.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.190
Iljo.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.060
I'm not a pushover.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.470
You're just telling me not to give up
on everything just for you, right?

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.780
You're saying that you decided to

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.340
let go of me because you like me too much
and didn't want to ruin my future.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.090
Not that much...

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.590
Hey!

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.600
Seriously...

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.640
-I was so sincere, you just had to...
-Hold on!

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.380
I'm still sick, Jeonghan.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.090
Oh, right.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.760
-Got it, got it.
-I'm sick.

00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:57.761
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.060
Lie down.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.530
Come closer.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.660
Stop it!

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.670
Come on!

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.050
[Two months later]

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.980
Thank you.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.000
Looks like Uncle was really mad.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.520
Don't even talk about it.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.490
I almost died.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.470
Look at the bruises.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.280
Couldn't you be more tactful?

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.620
Why were you so honest?

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.110
I wanted to be honest

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.280
about my feelings.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.370
You're really something.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.230
You beat your great father, after all.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.030
I'm the only son in my family.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.100
My cousins are all messy like Seo Jeongin.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.440
My dad has no choice.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.390
But I promised to be in charge
of the overseas branch.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.590
Hey.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.790
Why are you guys always so reckless?

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.320
It's because of how you're like
that Iljo had a hard time.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.180
I heard you haven't seen each other
for over a month.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.750
Are you my friend or Iljo's friend?

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.250
You darn loser.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.320
Hey, I'm a patient!

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.970
What about Iljo?

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.230
He's not coming with you?

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.340
Yes, we're going to meet at the airport.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.260
I'm heading off.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.050
Thanks.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.170
Jeonghan.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.880
What?

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.080
Will he really go?

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.810
What?

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.920
I'm talking about Iljo.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.750
What if...

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.940
he doesn't show up there?

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.850
I'm curious.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.360
Why would Lee Iljo

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.980
think of leaving me?

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.590
I have nothing.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.720
What do you mean you have nothing?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.890
You have me.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.340
You have me,
who has everything.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.870
So you have everything.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.890
Is that so?

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.640
Iljo.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.290
Hmm?

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.750
There's something I'm curious about.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.200
I'm really ready to give my future to you.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.100
I want to be your family.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.560
I hope the fate we share is one where
there are misunderstandings,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.830
we fight,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.770
or get hurt—

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.220
where conflicts like this

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.390
will always arise.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.410
What about you?

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.730
Are you ready?

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.910
[Iljo, I'm setting off.]

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.740
It's Iljo.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.220
The sound of the footsteps
running towards me.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.670
No matter how far
this tiny sound comes from,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.630
I will know

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.560
if it's Iljo.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.180
Iljo, are you ready?

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.590
Yes.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.930
What about Uncle's house?

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.470
It's fine.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.670
I now have something else
I want to protect more.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.520
Something you want to protect?

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.750
That's you.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.570
Also,

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.300
I am all yours.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.910
My future,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.410
my present,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.390
and my past.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.670
And I

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.150
shall receive the weight of my future—

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.070
that is you running into my arms
with all your might.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.840
When can we get there?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.600
It's hot, right?

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.760
If we walk another 5 minutes...

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.120
You said 5 minutes just now, too.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.970
How can you
live in a countryside like this?

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.000
Huh?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.040
What's going on?

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.310
I think it's going to rain.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.780
All of a sudden?

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.180
This place is always like this.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.370
The rain would always come suddenly
and stop suddenly.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.930
Hey, over there! Run!

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.430
I don't want you to go back to Seoul.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.200
Hey.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.170
Don't say such scary things.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.570
Let's leave when the rain subsides.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.270
I want to hang out with you forever.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.300
Or rather,
I hope you can come over every holiday.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.530
Lee Iljo.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.460
You can just come over.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.510
Why ask me to come over?

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.340
You come over.
