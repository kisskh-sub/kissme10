Hello?

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.883
Yes, I'm here.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.152
I'm near the studio you mentioned.

00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:36.422
I'm sorry, Ms. Han. I might be a bit late.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.125
It's okay. Take your time.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.495
Everyone said they'd go straight
to the restaurant for the reservation.

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:43.863
Let's meet there.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:47.533
There's still some time
before the reservation.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:50.636
I think I'll look around here for a bit.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.406
But I didn't know
there was a place like this here.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.741
The person who runs that place...

00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:57.944
used to live in that neighborhood
before studying abroad.

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:01.080
I see.

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:04.016
This place has a nice vibe.

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:07.653
Right.
Didn't you live around there too, Ms. Han?

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:09.055
I did.

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:10.856
But I haven't been back in a while.

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:14.026
Okay, be careful on your way.

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:15.494
Okay.

Yeah.

My Young Seo?

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:51.437
Young Seo says she's going
to the elite universities, of course.

00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:56.075
Which major? Law school anyway.

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:57.944
Yeah.

00:05:58.644 --> 00:05:59.545
Yeah.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.884
Right. There's no one like my Young Seo.

00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:08.754
Okay. I'll treat you.

There's nothing to worry about with her.

Why do you only listen to heavy metal?

00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:48.794
Because it makes things quiet.

00:06:49.962 --> 00:06:51.764
What? Where did you put mine?

00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.334
Is that why you smoke too?

- Hey.
- Let's switch for a while.

00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:03.843
What kind of nonsense is that?
Stop messing around and give mine back.

That's it?

What more should I say?

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:55.681
I just mean there's a lot of variety...

00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:00.519
Anything else?

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:06.359

there's regular and menthol.

You don't even have to smoke.

00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:12.131
You keep bringing up cigarettes.
Is that your leverage?

There's no need to be defensive.

00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:16.335
If you're going to threaten me,
just go report it.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.672
Even if you do, I doubt
the homeroom teacher would believe you.

00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:22.909
Why?

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.678
Because it's coming
from a delusional student?

00:10:38.424 --> 00:10:41.227
Not even practical music, but composition.

00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:44.764
Our school isn't an arts high school.

00:10:44.764 --> 00:10:46.098
It's a regular high school.

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:47.867
You know that too, Hyun Ha.

00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:50.937
I like classical music.

00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:53.406
Why that, of all things?

00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:59.078
Because it quiets my mind.

00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:04.450
Still, it's too late.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.252
It's almost delusional.

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:08.187
It's my dream.

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:12.224
Yeah, dreams are fine,

00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:14.994
but if it doesn't work out...

00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:17.363
Then it can't be helped.

00:11:19.098 --> 00:11:20.099
But still,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.002
does that mean you shouldn't dream?

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:36.782
You're awful.

00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:40.152
Why use my dream...

00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:42.622
to look down on me?

00:12:03.342 --> 00:12:04.710
It smells like sweat.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.246

that I quit music.

is basically your CSAT score, Young Seo.

00:19:58.484 --> 00:20:00.453
At this level, you can assume...

00:20:00.453 --> 00:20:02.255
you won't get into any of the universities
you're aiming for.

00:20:02.255 --> 00:20:05.191
(Counseling Room)

00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:06.225
And your parents?

00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:08.394
Do they know
your September mock exam score?

00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:10.830
Hyun Ha, congrats.

00:20:11.397 --> 00:20:12.598
I knew you'd make it.

00:20:12.598 --> 00:20:14.867
Hyun Ha, I didn't know you were that good.
This is huge.

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:17.003
They even hung a banner at school for you.

00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:18.237
Did you see it hanging over there?

00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:20.239
I knew you'd make it.

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:21.908
It's nothing, really.

00:20:21.908 --> 00:20:24.110
Hey, how is this nothing?

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.711
I'm proud of you, my friend.

00:20:28.014 --> 00:20:30.149
(There is no end to learning.)

00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:34.754
Are things hard for you these days?

00:20:36.489 --> 00:20:37.523
You're not mad at me?

00:20:38.457 --> 00:20:39.592
Why would I be?

00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:42.762
You've always managed well on your own,

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:45.665
so I think it's my fault
for not paying closer attention.

00:20:46.832 --> 00:20:48.501
It's not your fault, Mom.

00:20:49.568 --> 00:20:52.605
I'm the one who's sorry
for disappointing you.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.210
I'm not disappointed.

00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:04.183
I know you'll do much better
in the real thing.

00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.699
Don't do anything today. Just rest.

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:22.969
Go change and come out.
I'll make you something good.

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:24.637
Okay.

00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:53.065
(Dream)

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.009
Hey, how long is that thing
going to stay up?

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:03.910
I don't know.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.279
It's kind of embarrassing
every time I walk into school.

00:22:06.979 --> 00:22:09.248
It'll probably still be up next year,
even after graduation.

00:22:09.248 --> 00:22:10.116
Exactly.

00:22:10.983 --> 00:22:11.884
What about the CSAT?

00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:13.920
I gave up.

00:22:16.656 --> 00:22:17.390
Hey, Han Young...

00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:43.215
The owner of the laundromat
by the back gate filed a complaint.

00:22:43.916 --> 00:22:46.552
They say there's still a student...

00:22:46.552 --> 00:22:48.821
smoking in the alley
in front of the laundromat.

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:50.923
Therefore,

00:22:51.891 --> 00:22:55.561
I will now conduct a bag check.

00:22:58.764 --> 00:23:00.232
Freeze.

00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:04.437
Starting from the first row.

00:23:13.045 --> 00:23:14.680
Jae Hyung, you need to shave your head.

00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:25.658
What's this?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.301
Ki Hyun Ha, is this yours?

00:23:43.709 --> 00:23:44.644
Yes.

00:23:47.146 --> 00:23:48.180
Teachers' office.

00:23:49.148 --> 00:23:51.250
Everyone else, get ready for class.

00:23:53.252 --> 00:23:54.320
Yes, sir.

00:24:13.406 --> 00:24:15.508
In the end, I couldn't find the courage.

00:24:16.642 --> 00:24:18.477
And like winter arriving without warning,

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:22.882
the space between us froze over.

00:24:23.516 --> 00:24:24.450
(CSAT D-1)

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.886
- Number 18, Yoo No Eul.
- Yes.

00:24:28.921 --> 00:24:30.923
Since you haven't studied at all,

00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:32.358
- let's hope you guess well.
- I'll do my best.

00:24:32.358 --> 00:24:33.893
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:37.063
Number 19, Han Young Seo.

stay calm, and you'll be fine.

Hey, Han Young Seo.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.748
Hey.

00:24:58.017 --> 00:24:58.918
What?

00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:01.554
You're not even looking at me.

00:25:02.955 --> 00:25:04.257
If you have something to say, say it now.

00:25:04.957 --> 00:25:05.891
Why?

00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:08.361
Is studying until the last day
too important to waste time on me?

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:10.997
Yeah, so hurry up.

00:25:14.433 --> 00:25:15.268
What are you doing?

00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:17.169
The lyric-writing lecture.

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:19.705
I signed you up, so go listen to it.

00:25:20.439 --> 00:25:22.341
Hey, I told you not to do that.

00:25:23.376 --> 00:25:25.177
Who do you think you are,
signing me up for something like that?

00:25:25.177 --> 00:25:26.946
If you get into college that way,

00:25:26.946 --> 00:25:28.114
does that mean everything's settled?

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.085
For me, yeah.

00:25:34.887 --> 00:25:37.189
Sure, the CSAT matters.

00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:38.624
But you can always take it again.

00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:39.792
But right now, you and I...

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:47.967
Hey, Ki Hyun Ha.

00:25:49.735 --> 00:25:51.370
I told you from the start...

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:53.906
not to say unnecessary things.

00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:57.843
I...

don't want to waste any more time...

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:02.915
getting lost in dreams and delusions
because of you.

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:22.134
- CSAT.
- Good luck.

00:26:24.837 --> 00:26:26.639
Hey, stop solving problems.

00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:28.374
Good luck.

Perhaps the secret behind your beauty...

00:27:05.845 --> 00:27:08.981
does not lie in the possibility
of achieving anything,

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.688
but in the possibility of believing...

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:18.491
that you can achieve anything.

00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:36.576
Did you do well on the exam?

00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:49.722
Ki Hyun Ha?

00:27:52.058 --> 00:27:53.559
Hyun Ha went abroad.

00:27:55.061 --> 00:27:57.063
He didn't want to dampen the mood
before the CSAT,

00:27:58.764 --> 00:28:00.333
so he left without telling anyone.

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:03.603
He asked me to pass along his regards.

a complete beginning, middle, and end,

Someone I wasn't close to.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.638
Someone who merely stood out.

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:16.842
Someone who could've just passed by.

00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:21.347
That person pierced straight through me
in the end...

00:29:23.382 --> 00:29:24.483
as my first love.

instead of a scar,

00:29:33.893 --> 00:29:35.061
a dream remained.

00:29:39.432 --> 00:29:40.633
I wanted to say...

00:29:42.435 --> 00:29:43.970
that the reason I'm here now...

00:29:44.337 --> 00:29:45.938
is because there was someone...

00:29:45.938 --> 00:29:48.074

more than I believed in myself.
