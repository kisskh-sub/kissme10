["Fuego" by Gigi Rosa

00:41.916 --> 00:43.543
[man 1] A dancer once said

00:45.128 --> 00:48.506
that love sometimes takes
an unexpected shape

00:49.549 --> 00:51.968
and suddenly appears before you.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.519
Hidden longings.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.732
Passion without words.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.987
Graceful and serene.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.741
At times, fierce and wild.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.038
With a subtle game of give and take.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.809
[man 1] To whom do we whisper our love?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.605
How do we feel when our hands are joined?

01:45.688 --> 01:47.065
[man 2] Okay!

01:51.528 --> 01:55.698
[speaking Spanish]

02:03.248 --> 02:06.251
[man 1 in English] Maybe dance itself
is the vessel we need.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.213
A perfect way to nurture our love.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.969
The steps are perfect.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.513
The form, flawless.

02:19.764 --> 02:24.727
But this man's dance…
is missing something crucial.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.401
A year ago,

02:32.735 --> 02:34.571
I found out what it was.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.692
to our "Emperor of Dance," who won…

03:12.775 --> 03:14.569
[Suzuki] I hate this guy.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.945

[crowd shouting indistinctly]

03:41.846 --> 03:45.016
[Suzuki] In competitive dance,
there are two different styles.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.063
Ballroom dance,
which Shinya Sugiki specializes in.

03:50.688 --> 03:56.861
The waltz, tango, Viennese waltz,
slow foxtrot, and quickstep.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.780
They compete in all five dances.

Latin American.

Cha-cha-cha, samba,
rumba, paso doble, and jive.

[Suzuki] The World Cup of Dance
is where dancers

06:15.333 --> 06:19.754
who have mastered both ballroom and Latin
compete in all ten dances.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.344
You need to have the stamina
to dance 40 songs in one day,

Both your body and mind
are pushed to the limit.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.059
Does it feel good to perform
for a home audience?

07:15.143 --> 07:17.353
[Sugiki] Yes, it's very good
to be back home.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.940
And Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami wanted
to show a new side of ourselves.

[man 1] Only a two-letter difference
in their names,

07:35.663 --> 07:38.166
but Latin and ballroom
are totally different styles.

[Aki] What?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.498
What do you mean
Shinya Sugiki invited us to the 10 Dance?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.457
When?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.459
-Just now.
-What?

08:21.959 --> 08:23.044
I said no.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.004
You said no?

08:25.087 --> 08:28.549
Wait, but it means that Shinya Sugiki
is offering to teach us himself, right?

the 10 Dance takes?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.269
Know how many dances you do in a day?

08:41.312 --> 08:44.398
Five ballroom, five Latin,
and you've gotta dance 'em four times.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.943
First round, second round,
semis, and finals.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.569
-[Aki grunts]
-That's 40 songs.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.323
We usually only dance 20 songs at most.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.867
That's double what we do. Double.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.620
[Aki] But, you know,
even if it's just practice,

08:57.703 --> 08:59.830
I'd love to be led by Shinya Sugiki
at least once.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.207
I don't care.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.669
I mean, I'm always playing the role
of a slut who gets dumped by a man,

09:04.752 --> 09:06.420
or a cheating woman,
or something like that.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.507
Oh, really? You're the one who said
you can't pull off a princess.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.259
No, I didn't.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.262
Whatever. We're the national champions,
and they're the world champions.

-[Sugiki] Second.
-That's it.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.727
We took second in the World Championships.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.858
I've never been first
at the World Championships.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.368

second place in the world.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.871
Asians can't be number one--

09:40.955 --> 09:43.749

for who you are.

A champion
who could compete at the Worlds,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.339
and yet gives it up time and again.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.632
And sure, you'd be taking a chance,

14:44.550 --> 14:49.054
but they say the true champion
is the one who can win the 10 Dance.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.145
If you teach them the Latin dances

14:56.854 --> 14:59.607
and Sugiki teaches us ballroom in return…

15:02.443 --> 15:04.570
then I think we can compete at the Worlds.

with ballroom dancing?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.172
-I am a professional.
-I see.

18:11.131 --> 18:14.510
Then you'll take the lead,
and I'll follow.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.766

18:32.694 --> 18:34.696
Lower your sense of contact.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.990
From the stomach down to the knees.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.911
One, two, three.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.705
One, two, natural turn.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.461
The waltz was originally
a courtship dance,

18:49.545 --> 18:52.714
but the hold is like wearing handcuffs.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.343
Graceful on the surface,
but with restraint and control.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.053
[feet stomp]

19:01.473 --> 19:02.599
[door opens]

19:03.350 --> 19:05.477
[Aki] Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.318
What is it? Something wrong?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.695
He rubbed his dick on me.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.866
[Aki] I'm so sorry about this.

19:18.949 --> 19:19.950
It's fine.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.786
Shall we get started, then?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.787
Yes.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.957
-In ballroom, you're D Class?
-Yes.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.001
Take my contact.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.170
-Let it sink into your body.
-Okay.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.504
What do you wanna do?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.382
Do we stop or continue?

19:35.465 --> 19:38.260
[Fusako] One, two, three. One, two, three.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.095
You can quit if you want.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.097
[Fusako] Running spin turn.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.516
One, two, three.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.560
One, two, three.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.270
One… Good.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.731
One, two, and three.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.941
One, two, and three.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.943
One, two, spin, turn.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.237
One, two, three.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.864
One, whisk.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.658
One, two, three.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.161
One, two, three.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.413
[twangy jaunty music playing]

20:06.496 --> 20:09.416
-Stretch your arm out, like this.
-[Suzuki] Two, three, four.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.585
[Fusako] Your shoulder blades
move with your pelvis.

20:11.668 --> 20:15.589
Hockey stick. Two, three, four.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.343
Two, three, New York.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.596
-[Aki] Catch it inside.
-Two, three, four.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.515
-[Aki] Shoulder turn.
-Two, and three, and four.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.642
[Fusako] Both arms?

20:26.725 --> 20:29.603
-Two, three, four.
-[Aki] Yes, like an undulation.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.189
Two, and three, and four.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.150
Two, three, four.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.445
-[Aki] Pelvis moves too.
-Two, and three, and four.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.656
Okay, that's enough.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.740
How was it?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.912
-Terrible.
-[Aki] The same for the left.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.039
Your hip movement is so fake.

20:50.040 --> 20:50.999
Look.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.169
Watch how my body moves.

[Velcro rips]

21:05.222 --> 21:06.306
[breathy] Four.

21:07.724 --> 21:10.686
Two, and three, and four.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.563
See that?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.109
It's not just in the hips.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.863
When you do it,
your body's not undulating.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.075
Three and four.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.661
Feel the weight moving.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.080
You've gotta feel it

21:30.789 --> 21:31.915
from the spine

21:33.292 --> 21:34.835
through the shoulder blades…

21:38.463 --> 21:40.590
into the arm movements.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.344
Two, three, four.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.056
Two, three, four.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.643
Two, and three, and four.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.567
See this? It's sweat.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.943
-Yes.
-Do you get it?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.403
Yes, I understand.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.780
Your hip movement is amazing.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.490
It's my job to shake my hips.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.742
[laughs]

22:06.825 --> 22:08.243
-[Aki] Think you can do it?
-Got it?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.120
-Just copy what I do.
-Right.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.872
Come here. Put your hands right here.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.540
-[Aki] Shorten it.
-On your hips.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.584
-[Aki] Make it smaller.
-[Fusako] A little smaller?

22:16.251 --> 22:17.252
[Aki] That's right.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.589
A bit more. Yeah, like that.

[Suzuki] Two, and three, and four.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.053
-[Aki] Now squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
-Two, three, four.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.346
-Move less.
-[Aki] That's it.

Two, three, and four.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.516
[Aki] Mm-hmm.

-[Aki] That's it. That's it.

-[Aki] Two, three, four.
-Two, three, four.

Aki, keep counting.

-[Aki] Two, three, four.
-Three, four.

-[Aki] Two, three, four.
-[Suzuki snaps fingers]

22:53.705 --> 22:55.290

22:57.501 --> 22:59.586
[Aki] Two, three, four.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.505
…then Latin dance is raw eroticism.

[Aki] …three, four.

[intriguing ethereal music playing]

23:06.635 --> 23:08.261
Arouse them, seduce them.

-[laughs]
-[Aki] Two, three, four.

-Four.

One, two, three.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.905
One, two, three.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.659
[Aki] Sorry. Suzuki can be
a little rough around the edges.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.827
[Fusako] Don't worry.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.121
So you two together?

23:34.830 --> 23:36.039
[Aki chuckles]

23:36.748 --> 23:39.709
Well, there was something there
at one point, I guess.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.338
But now, I just want to go further
as dance partners.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.760
How about you and Mr. Sugiki?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.846
There's love in your dancing.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.393
Mr. Sugiki took me as a partner
when I was nothing.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.228
He's brought me so far.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.940
I trust him with everything

24:02.566 --> 24:04.526
and just follow his lead.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.698
I've never felt loved by him at all,

24:10.657 --> 24:12.576
and I don't think I need to.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.383
[music fades]

24:29.050 --> 24:31.636
[Sugiki] We still have some time
before the first train.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.972
You can rest a little longer.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.061
Do you do this every day?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.988
I can't stand it.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.992
I won't be second again.

[Sugiki exhales]

25:00.373 --> 25:04.669

an audience boo judges' decisions.

[sighs]

25:09.966 --> 25:11.259
I recall

25:11.760 --> 25:14.262
you said you liked being number one,
didn't you?

25:16.097 --> 25:18.892
I also like being at the top of the pack.

25:20.810 --> 25:24.731
-I'm only at the top of my turf, right?
-[Sugiki] Are you going to go all in?

Doesn't it look like it?

had gone right through me.

It stirred my soul.

that hot wind of Havana.

the world may be,

by ladies and gentlemen.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.750
It looks very elegant,
but it's also relentless.

29:13.793 --> 29:18.006
The woman must dance in those high heels,
twisting her waist for hours on end.

29:19.048 --> 29:22.385
The pain is pure torture.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.932
And in such a state,

29:28.016 --> 29:31.186
she will not yield
to a rough and vulgar man.

Without me,
just standing is hard, isn't it?

During hardship, the gentleman
offers his hand to support his partner.

You get it?

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.547
before he paired up with Fusako.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:09.010
Their tango was so…
[inhales sharply] …passionate.

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:15.516
Uh, I mean, it was obvious
that Shinya was crazy about Liana.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.896
But when he proposed to her,
something got in the way.

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:21.230
[Fabio] So I hear.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:24.650
Giulio and Shinya's attack
is very similar.

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.694
Their ability is evenly matched,

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:31.115
or perhaps maybe there's just
the narrowest of margins between them.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.160
But the one who gets to stand
at the top of the podium is who?

01:29:34.243 --> 01:29:35.411
-Giulio.
-[Nino] Giulio.

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.581
[Fabio] Shinya doesn't have what it takes
to overcome that slight margin.

01:29:38.664 --> 01:29:41.501
-I'm sorry, Nino.
-No. I don't agree, Fabio. No, no, no.

01:29:41.584 --> 01:29:45.421
Everyone is here to see
his obsessive determination.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:46.339
[Fabio] I know.

01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:49.425
[Nino] And everyone comes here
to see him valiantly struggle…

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:50.593
[sighs]

01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:52.887
…just to end up losing again.

01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:53.930
[Fabio] Yes.

01:29:54.013 --> 01:29:57.058
[Nino] The only person here
who thinks he has a chance of winning

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:59.852
is probably Shinya himself.

01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:04.065
What the hell are you saying?

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.442
-Excuse me?
-Don't just say that.

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:08.403
Do something about it!

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:10.279
That "slight margin" you mentioned,

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:13.366
you mean Sugiki's
actually a better dancer, right?

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:18.121
-So help him win!
-Easy, calm down. Come on, Shinya, please.

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:20.456
You guys have the power to do that,
don't you?

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.457
No, I… I don't know.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.709
-I'm telling you, let him fucking win!
-Hey. Whoa, whoa!

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.753
-[Fabio] Calm down.
-[Nino] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:26.963
-[Fabio] Easy.
-[Nino] Sorry…

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:28.423
-That's bullshit!
-[Nino] I'm sorry.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:32.718
-But there's nothing we can do.
-I… I'm so sorry. So sorry.

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:34.887

but look at him.

[Nino] Mm.

of the perfect gentleman.

-You know, even I wanna be like him.
-[Nino] I know what you mean.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:02.225
[Fabio] He's the ideal lover
that everyone wants to be.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:04.477
[Nino] So true. So true.

Ah.

I can't forgive that.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:55.040
So you think I'm still in love with Liana?

01:35:57.001 --> 01:35:59.545
That I've never even looked
at another woman?

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:03.632
That I've remained totally devoted to her?

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:07.303
Is that what you saw?

If the audience saw a reunion
between two lovers,

then tonight's show was a success.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.818

after that, were they?
