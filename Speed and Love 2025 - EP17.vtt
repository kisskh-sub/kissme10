[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.789
[Episode 17]

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.800
Well...

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.960
Mrs. Zhao.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.120
Could you please not

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.620
tell my dad about what happened just now?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.290
Mu,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.700
I probably

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.960
shouldn't be the one saying this,

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.120
but I've watched Zhao grow up.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.120
Life hasn't been easy on him these years.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.450
He's been through a lot.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.930
He's a reliable young man.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.079
But I think...

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.560
Your mom

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.020
definitely won't approve.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.010
You really need

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.700
to think this through carefully.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120
Honestly speaking,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.520
I want Zhao to lead a good life.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.770
Actually, since you came here,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.730
I've already noticed

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.240
that you've had your mind

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.290
on him this whole time.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.010
I came here just for him.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.050
And I stayed for him, too.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650
Mrs. Zhao,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.850
please help me.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.170
Then let's just pretend

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.680
that I didn't see

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.590
what happened today.

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.490
Go get some rest.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.000
How's it?

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.080
Did you find Jiang Mu?

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.780
He's in Jin Qiang's place.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.050
When you called me,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.610
I was almost worried sick.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.240
Is she okay?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.800
Listen, this is your fault.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.130
You didn't explain things clearly to her.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.820
This is way too dangerous.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.090
I don't want her to get involved.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.760
But that doesn't mean you can
hide it from her.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760
What else can I do?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.170
Tell her.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.120
And make her worry about me?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.730
You think you're protecting her.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.220
You think she can't do anything.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.550
Have you ever asked her?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.400
Anyway, everything I did was

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.290
for her own good.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.460
For her own good?

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.410
Do you know what she thinks?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.570
Why do you think it was for her own good?

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.650
You think you know it better than me?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.850
I just know it better!

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.050
You know what? I've heard the phrase,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.700
"for his good," too many times
since I was little.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.700
It's completely useless, you know?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.200
I don't want to argue with you.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.120
Brandy!

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.970
Can you stop being so arrogant?

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.390
There's no way you can keep this a secret.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.980
Today, she found out by accident.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.290
But what about next time?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.620
And the time after that?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.530
Are you going to hide it
every single time?

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.409
Instead of letting others tell her,

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.120
why don't you tell her yourself?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.780
Because I know what I'm doing!

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.890
She's my girlfriend.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.970
I don't need you to teach me.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.440
Yes.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.220
She is your girlfriend.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.280
But she is Jiang Mu first!

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.240
Why are you here?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.880
I'm here
because I want you to persuade Jin Zhao

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.170
to stay away
from the Association's affairs.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.230
What Association?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.220
You don't need to know about that.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.570
Anyway, just talk to him.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.210
He'll listen to you.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.050
He's different from others.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.440
If he just works steadily,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.120
he'll make his mark someday.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.760
He shouldn't get involved in those things.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.530
What things?

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.650
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.380
I also overheard it from my dad.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.300
Anyway, just make sure he stays away
from the Association no matter what.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.960
The people there are dangerous.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.090
They'll eat him alive

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.550
and leave nothing behind.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.880
Jiang Mu,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.000
you must try everything to persuade him

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.930
to stay away from the Association.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.240
Tell him to quit

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.090
whatever he's doing right now.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.380
Jin Zhao,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.980
I need to talk to you.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.600
Last night, I wasn't...

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.410
I know.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.960
Zhao.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.600
No matter what you're planning to do,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.400
you must make sure you stay safe.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.010
Can you promise me that?

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.650
I'll try.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.480
Are you

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.630
doing those dangerous things

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.890
for money?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.520
How did you find out about this?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.980
Was it Wan Qing?

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.270
Did she ask you to talk me out of it?

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.590
So you're quite loyal.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.010
Mom said

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.230
that she'll sell the house

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.770
and leave me some money.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.600
So

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.100
would that be enough?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.010
Listen.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.080
It's not about the money.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.090
It's so late. You came all this way

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.220
to ask me about this.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.650
Aren't you tired?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.850
Are you tired? I'll sleep with you.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.280
No, no, no.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.600
I mean,

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.910
you sleep, and I'll stay by your side.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.040
Stay with me?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.080
Then hang on. Let me take a shower.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.170
What are you looking at?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.960
I'm looking at your book.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.120
Are you interested in it?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.560
Not really.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.350
In that Scramble

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.410
I accidentally got involved in,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.130
was that bag the final prize?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.570
Yes.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.010
Who usually offers these prizes?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.730
Whoever organizes it

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.130
provides the prize.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.370
Organize?

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.840
Are you saying

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.050
that there's a huge organization

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.650
like the Association?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.260
Is that usually how the games are played?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.860
These casual games are rare.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.060
They're held occasionally.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.320
Only rich kids play these kinds of games.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.820
What about the serious games then?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.410
You've got some nerve asking that.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.270
You don't have the guts to answer?

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.740
They are not anything good.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.900
The less you know, the better.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.600
Wan Qing was even willing
to humble herself,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.680
asking me to persuade Jin Zhao
to give up

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.340
and not mess
with the Association's interests.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.560
What exactly is

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.840
this so-called Association?

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.890
Is it some sort
of dangerous underground organization?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.490
What on earth did Jin Zhao do?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.960
I'm just there to make money.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.920
Once I've earned enough, I'll leave.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.780
It's not like I'm killing anyone.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.330
What's the panic for?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.440
Then...

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.100
Then how much longer are you
going to keep this up?

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.620
Not long.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.310
It'll be over soon.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.800
How soon is "soon"?

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.390
At most...

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.720
Two weeks.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.200
Two weeks?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.890
So after 2 weeks,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.060
you won't do
such dangerous things anymore?

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.110
Yes.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.650
I promise you.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.490
Did you catch anything?

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.500
Here you are.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.870
Take a break.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.690
Looks like something's biting.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.770
That's my float.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.430
I know what to do.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.440
I don't need you to teach me.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.010
Fine.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400
The float really seems to be moving.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.820
It's really moving! Look!

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.110
Get the net! Quickly!

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.870
Pull it over! Come on!

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.650
Don't lose it!

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.370
-Be careful.
-Pull it closer.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.480
-Catch it!
-Got it!

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.470
Here it comes!

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.280
You asked me to lift the rod, didn't you?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.580
And you asked me to get the net, right?

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.780
Remove it now.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.980
You fished all day
and only caught this one?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.740
Be quiet.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.160
I've thought it over.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:14.750
You were right.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.920
I was too arrogant.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.970
I'm planning to find a chance

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.180
to explain everything clearly to her.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.110
Brandy.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.390
You know my family's situation.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.240
My dad,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.940
for the sake of his pride

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.690
and his so-called masculinity,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.040
never tells anyone in the family

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.900
about anything that's happened.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.840
He says it's for our own good.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.140
But growing up,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.610
I've seen my mom

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.010
get worried sick
and scared too many times.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.390
Do you really think that's good for us?

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.570
You're my bro.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.340
Jiang Mu is my friend.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.040
I don't want you to follow my dad's path.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.240
I got it.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.130
The float's really moving!
Why didn't you tell me? Hey!

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.190
Get the net! Hurry!

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.680
Probably just trash again.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.440
Hurry!

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.610
Pull it over.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.610
It's gone.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.890
It got away.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.920
So that was really a fish this time.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.050
It's all your fault that I lost my fish.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.610
Have a drink.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.600
-Drink and then take it easy to fish.
-The rod.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.490
You fish, and I'll net for you.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.480
It's because you came
and scared all the fish away.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.910
Did you catch a single one before I came?

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.670
Of course I did! You're joking.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.390
[Speeding Auto House]

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.930
Jiang Mu!

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.540
Did you talk to him?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680
Yes, I did.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.330
Did he agree?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.440
Yes.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.460
He said 2 weeks.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.850
After 2 weeks,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.370
he will stay away
from these dangerous things.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.170
I believe him.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.670
What's the use of your belief?

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.370
You know what?

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.630
He'll be in trouble before 2 weeks are up.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.760
Brandy!

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.690
Brandy, we've got a problem!

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.240
What's wrong?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.380
The car was smashed.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.540
Where's Iron Cock?

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.210
He said his father was gravely ill

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.610
and left
after a quick update this morning.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.420
I took an outside order this morning.
Then I saw

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.520
the shop wasn't busy, so I went there.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.530
But when I arrived, I didn't see anyone.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.900
Master, I'm sorry.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.930
It was my fault for being negligent.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.100
It must be that old bastard
from Wan's who did it.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.100
So despicable.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.280
Sanlai, stop talking nonsense.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.840
Which eye of yours saw it?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.200
I-I really don't know anything about this.

Let me explain.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.170
I came here today to warn you.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.570
I would never mean to harm you.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.570
I said, get lost!

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.150
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.250
Fine, Jin Zhao.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.940
Listen.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.950
Whether you live or die,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.360
I won't care anymore.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.020

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.400
Okay.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.150
Let's go.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.900
Check the things.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.550
Okay, Master.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.930
Do you remember when you were little,

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.880
you failed your exam

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.630
and were too scared
to ask your mom to sign it?

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.050
After I signed it for you,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320
the teacher found out
and called for a parent meeting.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.090
You cried your eyes out

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.600
like it was the end of the world.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.650
I told you,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.540
"It's not a big deal.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.300
I can handle it."

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.730
Remember that?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.130
Do you trust me?

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.390
Yes, I do.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.020
Then go back to Jin Qiang's place,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.050
sleep well,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.410
and rest properly.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.090
Don't think about this mess.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.960
Cheer up,

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.330
okay?

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.420
He Zhang!

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.040
Madam.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.330
Coming.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.810
Here.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.390
How about 2 more of these?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.090
Okay.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.250
All right.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.070
This one.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:21.810
Are these okay?

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.090
T-That guy.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.760
That guy has been to the garage before,
right?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.370
I don't know him.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.240
You don't?

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.890
I think I've seen him
at the garage before.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.890
Don't you remember?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.170
Do you know how many people come

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.000
to the garage for car repair every day?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.200
I'm swamped.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.520
How can I remember everyone's face?

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.280
But later, when we ran

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.810
into this man at the market,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.270
Jin Zhao said
he had no impression of him at all.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.490
These will do.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:11.850
Yeah.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:12.850
See you next time.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:13.570
Bye-bye.

Young lady.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.390
Are you looking for me?

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:51.240
No, I'm not.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.680
If you're not looking for me,
why do you keep following me?

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.410
I... I...

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.350
I'm looking for my classmate.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:07.850
Pan Kai, over here!

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.440
Mu, what brings you here?

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.760
What a coincidence!
Do you live around here?

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.330
Yes, my dad's factory is just over there.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.990
I'm buying some fruit for him.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.140
That's nice.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.330
What are you doing here?

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.650
I'm here to find someone.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.450
Find someone?

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.270
Do I know them?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.660
I don't even know them myself.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.040
What fruit are you buying?

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.060
I bought a mango.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.850
Pick some for me, too.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.960
-I also like mango.
-Okay!

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.160
I'll buy some for you.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.980
Is this enough?

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.130
That girl has been tailing me.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.020
She must know something.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.070
Handle it by yourself.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.600
Remember,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.760
your biggest rival in the mountain race is

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.410
He Zhang from Wan's.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.510
Here you are.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.330
You need to defeat him

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.890
and stay safe, too.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.050
Okay.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:07.650
Just as I thought.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.140
What do you mean by that?

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.090
That person

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.110
told you he saw me?

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.630
You know way too much.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.380
You're not going to kill me
to silence me, are you?

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.570
What do you think we do?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.800
Since you've already heard about me
from Wan Qing,

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.530
you should know my situation.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.610
When I had worked for Wan Shengbang

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.140
for about 2 and a half years,

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:51.650
they occasionally

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.780
had me do some jobs outside the garage.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.960
There was one time
when his driver had an accident.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.360
The deposit was paid,
but no one would race.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480
So he turned to me.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.930
He wanted me to leave the garage

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.500
and do this job for him.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.360
But I refused.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.830
Later, Jin Xin needed money for surgery.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.440
I wanted to help them,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.850
so I borrowed money from Sanlai.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.410
I bought a car,

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.370
modified it overnight,

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.220
and sold it at a high price.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.610
Later, that car had an accident.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.170
I always thought it was because

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.700
of my technical oversight.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.110
I felt very guilty for those 2 years.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.560
I worked desperately to earn money

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.700
to compensate that family.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.170
But later,

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.950
I realized it wasn't my fault.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.040
Wan Dayong tampered with that car.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.480
I was set up.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.410
After that, I left Wan's.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.020
That's when Officer Lu approached me.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.700
Officer Lu is
from the Anti-smuggling Bureau.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.560
They were working on a major case.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.120
At first,
they just wanted some leads from me.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.440
Until later, when I approached him.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.080
That was after your arrival.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.240
What they're investigating isn't

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.440
Wan Shengbang at all,

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.440
nor is it any street racing organization.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.240
Through illegal street racing,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.500
they're trying to track down

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.910
the smuggling gang behind it.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.720
But this Association is very cautious.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.370
Having someone infiltrate it
out of nowhere is

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.500
simply impossible.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.890
Your points in the Association
must reach the top ranks

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.290
for you to get noticed
by those higher-ups.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.080
Brandy!

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.280
I've told you

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.640
that we don't allow outsiders here.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.770
Anti-smuggling Bureau officers
found it hard to infiltrate

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.850
until I came along.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.330
I told Officer Lu

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.370
that I could keep racing and competing

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.810
to earn points

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.400
and get into the alliance

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
to gather the information he needs.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.000
I'm ranked in the top 10 in points.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.170
If someone had to do this job,

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.720
I'd be the best choice.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.800
Because you had racing experience before,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.590
those in the Association
wouldn't suspect you.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.250
Quite smart.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.370
However,

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.480
that was only part of the reason.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.890
I had an opportunity
that was beyond suspicion.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.530
They thought I was getting involved

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.330
due to my grudge against Wan Shengbang.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.489
I had fallen out with him

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:11.440
and gone against him.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.290
I heard

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.690
that you're planning to interfere
with the business in Xikouguan.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.350
Quite ambitious, aren't you?

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.650
Whether I interfere
or not isn't up to you.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.980
It's not up to me either.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.409
We'll see who has what it takes.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.639
You're really something,

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.929
climbing the ranks ahead of others

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:25.770
and getting so much attention

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.330
in such a short time.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.860
Aren't you obviously

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.610
going against Mr. Wan?

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.730
Listen!

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.040
Don't be naive.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.010
It's not too late to back off now.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.560
Although this is just one factor.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.230
What about the others?

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.900
Officer Lu promised me...

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.150
As long as we solve this case,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.170
he will make sure Wan Shengbang

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.590
and his accomplices are
brought to justice.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.120
Once they're under arrest,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.670
I can successfully clear my name.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.970
The street racing organization is

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.290
actually just a front.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.560
They use street racing

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.150
to observe

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.090
and groom people
who can take over their business.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.000
Not everyone has the capability

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.480
and mental fortitude to handle this job.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.770
Only those top scorers in the alliance

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:28.700
can get noticed.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.540
It's because these people

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.620
all share some common traits.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:34.600
They're brave,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:36.770
reckless,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.900
and need money.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.140
600 HP!

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.080
650 HP!

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.380
It looks like RX7 has gone past 700 HP.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.120
Brandy, you're going hard tonight.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.050
You've already qualified.
No need to risk your life.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.560
So they damaged your car

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.530
because they didn't want you
to join the race?

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.420
Wan Shengbang knows

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.480
that if our dispute
comes out into the open,

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.090
the alliance won't stand by
and do nothing.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.150
There's only one solution

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.120
that can settle this matter.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.370
What solution?

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.130
According to custom,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.460
if both parties can't reconcile privately,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.600
they shall resort
to the most traditional solution,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.130
settling it with a car race.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.810
The losing side

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.380
must not cause trouble
for the other anymore.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.490
This is the rule.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.370
Can your car be fixed then?

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.900
It can be fixed.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.470
But I need some parts.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.470
More importantly,

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.520
I need to find a reliable repair shop

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.260
willing to take on this job.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.950
I want to clear my name.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.420
Especially since you came,

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.250
I've wanted it even more.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.000
I want to prove myself,

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.380
to prove that at least,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.130
I'm still worthy of you.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.810
Actually, on my way here,

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.210
I was thinking about
how to smooth over this issue

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.540
to put your mind at ease.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.770
But when I was almost here,
I realized something.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.600
If I told a lie for now

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.330
to cover up this problem,

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.910
then in the future,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.640
I would have to come up
with all kinds of excuses

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.770
to maintain that lie

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.370
and keep you worrying.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.520
Instead of doing that,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.950
I might as well come clean to you.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.590
Mu,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.820
I've explained everything

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.140
that I can explain.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.030
Go back to hit the sack,

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.630
okay?

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.560
This thing sounds super dangerous.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.500
Do you really have to do it?

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.590
I can't let them keep doing evil anymore.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520
This is something

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.370
only I can handle.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.420
Even if

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.540
it means sacrificing myself.
