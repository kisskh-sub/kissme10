WEBVTT

00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:01.802
(The second day at Yeon House)

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:02.879
(5-Minute Time Attack Date)

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.142
(The men have to ask for
a date within 5 minutes.)

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:07.542
(They get up right away.)

00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:11.118
(Mu Jin, who got up first, chose...)

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:13.512
(Bon Hee.)

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:15.658
(How about a date with me...)

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.782
(today?)

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.152
(Okay.)

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:20.828
(The first date began
with the younger men...)

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:22.722
(asking the women out.)

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.822
(Bus date: Mu Jin and Bon Hee)

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:27.138
(What was my first impression?)

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:29.332
(You were pretty.)

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:32.878
(Moments filled with
excitement like in a movie)

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:34.178
(Makgeolli workshop date:
Sang Won and Ye Eun)

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.542
(My interest in Sang Won has increased.)

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:38.602
(It made my heart flutter.)

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.142
(They seem a lot closer now.)

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.018
(Dinner date: Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong)

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.082
(I deboned this nicely.
(Would you like some?)

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.188
(Thank you.)

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.228
(It's beautiful behind you.)

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:52.792
(I've always wanted to
go on a date like this.)

00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:54.852
(But after a short moment of excitement...)

00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:57.322
(How many more people
do you want to get to know?)

00:00:58.422 --> 00:00:59.408
(One.)

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:00.868
(Thinking)

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:05.038
(But getting to know...)

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:06.302
(Honestly, I'm not too sure.)

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.848
(It didn't make me happy.)

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:14.312
(I couldn't hide my expression,
which put me in an awkward spot.)

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:16.982
(I don't know.)

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:20.728
(How did the first date
with mixed feelings end?)

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:21.828
What's nice about our show,

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.728
Noona is A Woman to Me,

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:26.068
- is that everything moves fast.
- Yes.

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:27.998
- That's why...
- It's easy to get immersed in it.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:29.292
- Yes.
- Totally.

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:30.562
When Sang Won

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:33.262
was asked if he was
interested in anyone else,

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:35.702
his answer was very honest.

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:37.638
Rather than getting caught,
being honest is better.

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:39.832
Being honest is,

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.272
in the end, really cool and better.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:46.318
But he was spending time with Ye Eun.

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:48.088
- He should've focused on her.
- It was...

00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:49.588
He shouldn't have said that.

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.088
He spoke too soon.

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:52.312
(He shouldn't have said that!)

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:57.782
(Sang Won and Ye Eun
return after their date.)

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.268
(The atmosphere turned
cold after the date.)

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:03.598
- Ye Eun...
- Oh, no.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.862
- Went straight to the kitchen.
- Straight there.

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:12.202
(Ye Eun returned to her room first.)

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.978
(Sighing)

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.142
She's sighing.

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:20.818
(Heading to Ji Won and Bon
Hee's room after getting changed)

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:23.212
(Trudging)

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:27.882
- Yes?
- Pardon me.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:31.952
- We were just chatting.
- Come in.

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:36.338
Both of you said you
could see their feelings.

00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:37.498
But how did you know?

00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:40.168
You can tell who's
interested in whom, right?

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.438
They look at the person
they're interested in,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.678
- and take care of them.
- Yes.

00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:46.782
From that, I realize who
they may have feelings for.

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:49.218
Do you catch that in the
women's and guys' gazes?

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.602
- Yes.
- Is that so?

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.372
Maybe I'm just slow-witted.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:56.142
- We're quite similar.
- Right?

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.418
- But...
- You can kind of feel it.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:58.419
- You can?
- Yes.

00:02:58.443 --> 00:02:59.852
But I have no clue.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:02.188
- Sang Won?
- Yes.

00:03:02.212 --> 00:03:03.882
- I don't get him.
- Me neither.

00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:05.298
Sang Won is a mystery.

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:07.398
Sang Won rarely expresses his feelings.

00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:08.422
Exactly.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.062
It's just a personal opinion, but I think

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:15.062
we're still in the stage of
getting to know each other.

00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:18.778
If I were to behave rashly,

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:21.372
it might burden the other person.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.942
Pressing forward too one-sidedly

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.888
is something to be careful about.

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.318
(Sang Won is careful about being certain.)

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.512
What was Sang Won like when you two talked?

00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:37.952
To be honest,

00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:40.868
I'm not sure.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.622
(To be honest, I'm not sure.)

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:47.562
(Ye Eun feels as much frustration
as the depth of her growing feelings.)

00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:50.432
It could've been a letdown.

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:52.262
This is bad.

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:58.348
(Sang Won returns to the men's room.)

00:03:58.372 --> 00:03:59.372
What?

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.042
What?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.188
For real?

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.092
(A new bed has been
placed next to Sang Won's.)

00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:11.658
(There were only 2 beds.)

00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:15.322
(Now there's another one.)

00:04:16.392 --> 00:04:18.262
That's true. There's another bed now.

00:04:19.232 --> 00:04:20.732
(Looking happy)

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:26.048
(Staring)

00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:27.172
Seriously?

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:28.749
(Surprised)

00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:30.372
What now? Hold on.

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:31.602
He's dumbstruck.

00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:33.548
What do we do? Hey.

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:34.612
Did you see it?

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:36.682
Another guy is coming.

00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:38.782
The sight of it was surprising.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.282
One more guy must be coming.

00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:42.252
It's the catfish.

00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:44.628
Look at his reaction.

00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:46.322
This will make it more interesting.

00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:47.998
He's always relaxed.

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:49.762
- He's enjoying it.
- For sure.

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.462
(Sang Hyeon doesn't know anything yet.)

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:55.908
(Surprised)

00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:57.238
- Hey.
- When did you get back?

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:58.332
- Just now.
- Just now?

00:04:58.532 --> 00:04:59.632
Did you see it?

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:03.142
(He stops in front of the unfamiliar bed.)

00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:05.812
I just got back and was shocked.

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:08.372
It's the catfish.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.258
- The catfish.
- How cute.

00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:13.458
- This is wild.
- I'm scared of the catfish.

00:05:13.482 --> 00:05:16.522
(The younger men are uneasy
because of the new male participant.)

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:19.028
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun
run into each other in the kitchen.)

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.622
One more guy will come.

00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:22.692
What?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.368
We've got another bed.

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.632
- Unbelievable. For real?
- Yes.

00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:31.732
Didn't we have spicy catfish stew today?

00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:34.978
(Was it a tailored menu?)

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.518
- The menu.
- Right.

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.578
Yeong Gyeong is quite cute.

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:39.802
To think she has such a charm.

00:05:40.642 --> 00:05:44.388
(Yeong Gyeong heads to Bon Hee
and Ji Won's room with the news.)

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:46.658
- Yes?
- She's going to deliver the news.

00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:47.888
Look who is happy.

00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:49.622
I just heard some interesting news.

00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:53.422
There's another bed in the men's room.

00:05:53.722 --> 00:05:54.922
Really?

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.492
I bet today's event will be...

00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:59.492
(Is today's event about a new younger man?)

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:02.262
- How exciting.
- It's a big event.

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:06.102
She's like a pigeon.

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:08.902
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.602
The guys have another bed.

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:14.748
- Really?
- What?

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:17.142
- Really?
- Isn't it shocking?

00:06:18.282 --> 00:06:19.828
- Have you heard?
- What?

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:21.688
That the guys have another bed.

00:06:21.712 --> 00:06:23.752
- No.
- One new bed has been added.

00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:25.892
A new guy must be coming.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.452
Oh, my gosh.

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:32.022
If this is how he's going to join,

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.862
don't you think he'll be an energetic guy?

00:06:36.732 --> 00:06:40.332
I hope he has a good build.

00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:46.172
Who will it be?

00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:48.612
I'm curious.

00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:53.112
What kind of an image do we not have?

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:56.452
Someone wearing glasses
who is good at studying?

00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:02.152
(Getting ready for a guy who wears
glasses and is good at studying)

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:05.792
(An image of a guy wearing
glasses and good at studying)

00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:09.108
(Nervous and keeping in check,
the younger men have become busy.)

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:11.538
The older women are excited, - Yes.

00:07:11.562 --> 00:07:14.148
While the younger men are worried.

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:15.872
- They must be nervous.
- It's different.

00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:19.872
(Meanwhile, )

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.188
(a car enters Yeon House.)

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:22.372
Here he comes.

00:07:23.582 --> 00:07:24.682
He's coming.

00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:31.852
Gosh.

00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:36.568
(Yeon House)

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:38.068
(With a tough-looking car, )

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.168
(the new younger man arrives.)

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.332
- He must have a big build.
- Even his car

00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:43.638
- looks sturdy.
- An off-road car.

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:44.932
Yes, off-road.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.342
He's tall. What?

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.528
He's tall.

00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:03.298
(Broad shoulders)

00:08:03.322 --> 00:08:04.958
What's with his shoulders? They are thick.

00:08:04.982 --> 00:08:06.868
It's not wide, but thick front to back.

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:07.952
(I love it.)

00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:12.462
(The new younger man is coming!)

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.562
I was thinking of an image we didn't have.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.562
Someone who is energetic and kind of...

00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:20.702
A real teto-guy?

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:22.572
Someone muscular.

00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:25.972
(I'm excited.)

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.042
I really want to see how
the women will react.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:34.912
(Is the new younger man an
energetic and muscular teto-guy?)

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.368
(The new younger man is
standing in front of the door.)

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:41.798
I'm certain he's an athlete.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:42.898
- Yes, an athlete.
- Totally.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.062
- Right?
- Yes.

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:45.992
(Tapping)

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:47.962
Are you nervous?

00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:49.162
- Me?
- Yes.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.632
Your finger keeps...

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.572
(Embarrassed and nervous)

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:00.818
I wonder what kind of role

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:02.318
he'll play in the current situation.

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:04.088
- Me too.
- He's giving off a different vibe.

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:05.632
- A completely different one.
- Right?

00:09:07.282 --> 00:09:08.282
(Curious)

00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:11.528
(Pursing his lips)

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:15.522
(There's only silence in Yeon House.)

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.272
Oh, no.

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:30.148
He went inside.

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:32.442
(The new younger man
has entered Yeon House.)

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.918
(A strange nervousness before
meeting the new participant)

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.012
Hi.

00:09:37.682 --> 00:09:38.912
Hi.

00:09:39.782 --> 00:09:41.462
- Oh, my gosh.
- He's coming in like this?

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.652
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:45.552
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:47.622
(Laughing)

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.662
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:59.772 --> 00:10:01.208
(A completely new type of younger man)

00:10:01.232 --> 00:10:02.572
He has smooth skin.

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:04.902
He's cute.

00:10:05.142 --> 00:10:06.742
He's right up the older women's alley.

00:10:09.882 --> 00:10:10.988
I can't help but smile.

00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:12.012
(Flipping her hair)

00:10:12.282 --> 00:10:13.628
(She also flips her hair.)

00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:14.728
(The older women's eyes
are fixed on the new man.)

00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:16.628
When women flip their hair, it means

00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:18.212
- they're interested in the guy.
- Yes.

00:10:18.622 --> 00:10:20.452
(Flipping lightly)

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:22.762
- Hi. He has a great body.
- Hi.

00:10:30.602 --> 00:10:32.038
Take a seat wherever you want.

00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:33.172
Where can I...

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:37.342
How about we take a seat like this?

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:39.202
- I'll sit here.
- Okay.

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:41.748
(They finally meet...)

00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:45.642
(the new younger man.)

00:10:46.652 --> 00:10:48.528
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:10:48.552 --> 00:10:49.582
Hi.

00:10:51.622 --> 00:10:52.652
Teto-guy.

00:10:53.222 --> 00:10:56.162
The moment he came, he
made a strong impression.

00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:00.932
He's very manly.

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.462
He definitely looks tough on the outside.

00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:07.332
But we'll see if he's tender on the inside.

00:11:10.972 --> 00:11:13.448
(And...)

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:16.712
(1 person in particular
seems to be glowing.)

00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:18.642
What's your ideal type?

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:20.412
I like teto-guys.

00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:22.652
I like teto-guys.

00:11:23.052 --> 00:11:26.222
(Teto-guys, Ji Won's unwavering ideal type)

00:11:28.952 --> 00:11:31.498
I said that a guy with
a good, bulky build

00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:33.892
would be the new guy.

00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:36.232
And I was right.

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:39.208
- What's your name?
- Right.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.972
My name is Yang Ji Yung.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.972
- Ji Yung?
- Yes.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.272
(Nodding)

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:48.442
(Smiling)

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:50.282
A real teto-guy came.

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:53.752
For real, just like we expected.

00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:56.622
Did you make guesses?

00:11:56.822 --> 00:11:58.882
He's a teto-guy even to the guys.

00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:01.092
A completely different style from me.

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:05.392
He gave off a very manly vibe.

00:12:07.492 --> 00:12:11.132
I thought he would come off as a
very charming guy to the women.

00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:14.302
(Relaxed)

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.472
You must work out.

00:12:17.402 --> 00:12:19.512
Exercising is my hobby,

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.112
so I do a handful of sports.

00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:23.158
If he's that big despite it being a hobby...

00:12:23.182 --> 00:12:24.159
(Agreeing)

00:12:24.183 --> 00:12:25.312
I know, right?

00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:28.312
There are fitness equipment pieces outside.

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:30.982
But I don't think anyone is using them.

00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:33.622
But I don't think anyone is using them.

00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:35.228
- Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon.

00:12:35.252 --> 00:12:38.138
- Did you work out?
- Yes, I did.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:39.608
- In secret?
- Yes, in secret.

00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:40.868
- That's right.
- Oh, dear.

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:42.532
- I had no idea.
- No, but I...

00:12:42.932 --> 00:12:44.262
(Slightly embarrassed)

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:48.072
(He's been building his
testosterone in secret.)

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:50.078
(A shy teto-guy)

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.502
Do you like working out?

00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:53.612
I do.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:57.212
Do you not work out? Do you not like it?

00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:58.582
I will exercise now.

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:00.112
I'd better start from now on.

00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:03.152
I should.

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:09.192
I got the feeling that
everyone there was nice.

00:13:09.692 --> 00:13:13.192
But none of the women
gave off a definite older vibe.

00:13:13.932 --> 00:13:15.192
Did everyone become close?

00:13:16.502 --> 00:13:17.578
Compared to yesterday...

00:13:17.602 --> 00:13:19.532
When did you move in yesterday?

00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:22.272
It's been about 24 hours since we met.

00:13:22.772 --> 00:13:23.848
About 24 hours.

00:13:23.872 --> 00:13:25.472
(Well, that's not bad.)

00:13:26.442 --> 00:13:28.442
(Glancing)

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:32.342
What's your ideal type of woman?

00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:34.282
- My ideal type?
- Yes.

00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:36.982
Appearance-wise,

00:13:38.122 --> 00:13:40.222
I like a woman with simple features.

00:13:41.222 --> 00:13:42.728
Simple is tough.

00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:44.022
(Simple features?)

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:48.132
- What about her personality?
- Personality-wise...

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:52.402
Someone who is proud of her job.

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.372
(Smiling)

00:13:55.472 --> 00:13:56.942
(Glancing)

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.242
The atmosphere is nerve-racking.

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:02.888
Before he arrived, the
atmosphere felt relaxing.

00:14:02.912 --> 00:14:05.858
But now, it's strange.

00:14:05.882 --> 00:14:08.212
(The atmosphere changed
with Ji Yung's arrival.)

00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:09.698
- But listen.
- Yes?

00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:13.298
When a new person arrives after
everyone has already become friends,

00:14:13.322 --> 00:14:16.228
- they become hesitant.
- Of course.

00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:18.998
Ji Yung is facing eight people,

00:14:19.022 --> 00:14:20.408
and they've already become close.

00:14:20.432 --> 00:14:23.678
Despite coming later, he's
leading the conversation.

00:14:23.702 --> 00:14:26.102
That shows he's not your average guy.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.012
- He's a real guy.
- He's not your average guy.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:36.272
(A text message has arrived at Yeon House.)

00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:38.318
(What is it?)

00:14:38.342 --> 00:14:39.712
They've got a text message.

00:14:40.452 --> 00:14:41.582
What does it say?

00:14:42.652 --> 00:14:48.752
(Tonight, reveal your job.)

00:14:49.052 --> 00:14:50.222
(Surprised)

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:51.722
Finally.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.438
Their jobs.

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:54.538
(Finally revealing their jobs)

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:55.539
In just two days?

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:57.963
- Revealing our jobs right away?
- We're to reveal our jobs.

00:14:58.202 --> 00:14:59.332
Finally.

00:14:59.502 --> 00:15:01.902
I didn't expect us to reveal it this fast.

00:15:02.372 --> 00:15:03.402
Like seriously?

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:07.212
I have no idea what
the guys do for a living.

00:15:07.442 --> 00:15:08.542
Me neither.

00:15:08.772 --> 00:15:12.082
Either way, I'm sure everyone has a job.

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:13.912
I'm curious.

00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:17.828
(What if they're all
incredibly competent people, )

00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:20.998
(such as lawyers?)

00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:22.622
(I wonder what they do for a living.)

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:25.062
I think you're in a creative field.

00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:27.892
I think he's a YouTuber.

00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:29.808
(There were many guesses about their jobs.)

00:15:29.832 --> 00:15:31.162
A literal creator.

00:15:33.102 --> 00:15:34.079
(As a new younger man joins them, )

00:15:34.103 --> 00:15:36.172
- As soon as he arrived.
- You're right.

00:15:37.172 --> 00:15:41.372
(they reveal their jobs.)

00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:43.988
It's called the Job Box.

00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:45.188
(There are hints in the Job Box.)

00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:46.342
Should I open one?

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:49.288
- I'm getting nervous.
- Right?

00:15:49.312 --> 00:15:51.282
- My heart is racing.
- So is mine.

00:15:51.782 --> 00:15:54.168
- I'm nervous for the first time.
- We're starting right away?

00:15:54.192 --> 00:15:55.192
Just like that?

00:15:56.192 --> 00:15:59.262
(They'll reveal their
jobs by opening the Box.)

00:15:59.832 --> 00:16:02.762
(Curious)

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.338
(What's the first item?)

00:16:05.362 --> 00:16:06.362
What's that?

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.008
- What is it?
- What's that?

00:16:08.032 --> 00:16:09.402
(What is that?)

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:10.902
- What's that?
- What is that?

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:14.788
(What could it be?)

00:16:14.812 --> 00:16:16.512
- It's...
- A film?

00:16:17.382 --> 00:16:18.642
An instant film.

00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:20.882
Is it related to cinema?

00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.498
A film?

00:16:23.522 --> 00:16:24.802
(Could it be related to cinema?)

00:16:25.482 --> 00:16:27.622
(His lips twitch.)

00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:31.092
Is Mu Jin smiling? No?

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:33.892
Or is it yours?

00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:38.202
I don't even know what
that is. What is that?

00:16:39.502 --> 00:16:41.002
- A film?
- Is it a CD?

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:43.448
(Everyone's getting curious.)

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:44.472
Maybe it's...

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:46.042
Is it him?

00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:48.488
(Sang Hyeon bursts into laughter.)

00:16:48.512 --> 00:16:50.312
- Maybe it's...
- That...

00:16:50.412 --> 00:16:51.482
Is it Sang Hyeon's?

00:16:52.682 --> 00:16:53.728
- Maybe it's...
- That...

00:16:53.752 --> 00:16:54.782
Is it Sang Hyeon's?

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.582
- Is it yours?
- Yes.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.659
Seriously?

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.928
(The first item belongs to Sang Hyeon.)

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.092
I'll tell you what this is.

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:04.322
It's a tape.

00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:05.538
A tape.

00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:06.562
(It was a tape.)

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.562
A videotape?

00:17:08.732 --> 00:17:11.362
I work at a securities company

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.848
as a database administrator.

00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:18.472
Simply put, I'm an IT engineer.

00:17:18.702 --> 00:17:20.142
(Intrigued)

00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:23.518
I said that you looked like an IT guy.

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.258
It suits you, though.

00:17:25.282 --> 00:17:26.442
(Shy)

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.622
(The symbol and hub of
finance in South Korea)

00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:35.222
I'm an IT engineer at a
securities firm in Yeouido.

00:17:36.052 --> 00:17:39.022
My job is to operate and
manage key in-house data.

00:17:40.132 --> 00:17:42.832
I've been interested in
IT ever since I was little.

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:47.172
And I wanted to handle
particularly financial data.

00:17:47.402 --> 00:17:50.202
That's how I ended up at a securities firm.

00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:52.978
This was the nerd we were looking for!

00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:54.588
(Kim Sang Hyeon, an IT
engineer at a securities firm)

00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:56.172
He's a brainiac.

00:17:56.372 --> 00:17:58.312
(Shy)

00:17:58.412 --> 00:17:59.658
(Amazed)

00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:01.012
(Exclaiming)

00:18:01.212 --> 00:18:06.382
This is a tape that can hold 12 terabytes.

00:18:06.992 --> 00:18:09.622
- So...
- That's a lot, isn't it?

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.292
If something were to happen to it...

00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.962
Then, I'd be in huge trouble.

00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:16.162
I don't even want to picture it.

00:18:17.302 --> 00:18:18.902
That's why he was so meticulous.

00:18:21.932 --> 00:18:24.942
I correctly guessed his job.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:30.588
(I think you work at a
startup or run an IT firm.)

00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:32.342
That's fascinating. How did she guess that?

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:37.322
"Were my feelings right?"

00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:40.022
I got more curious about him.

00:18:40.122 --> 00:18:42.122
I want to talk to him more.

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:44.968
She's more interested now.

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:47.468
(Will the older women have changed
their minds after his job reveal?)

00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:51.432
(Who will reveal their job next?)

00:18:52.202 --> 00:18:53.208
A pair of sunglasses.

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.108
(A random pair of sunglasses)

00:18:55.132 --> 00:18:56.202
What's this for?

00:18:57.472 --> 00:18:59.172
I think it belongs to a designer.

00:19:00.812 --> 00:19:03.312
(A designer?)

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.388
(Curious)

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:08.652
(Whose is it?)

00:19:08.852 --> 00:19:10.552
I feel like it's Sang Won's.

00:19:11.122 --> 00:19:13.022
- Yes, I agree.
- Yes.

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.868
Those are sports goggles.

00:19:15.892 --> 00:19:17.262
I feel like it's Sang Won's.

00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:18.822
Yes, it's mine.

00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:21.632
But

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.132
I don't think you can guess
from this. Do you want to try?

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:28.372
Maybe he's a track-and-field athlete.

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:29.702
A dermatologist?

00:19:30.842 --> 00:19:32.472
- It's for when he uses lasers?
- Yes.

00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:34.688
Or he could be a PE teacher.

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:37.342
Or he's a welder.

00:19:38.282 --> 00:19:39.612
I'll guess. A runner.

00:19:40.482 --> 00:19:42.288
(He definitely looks like a runner.)

00:19:42.312 --> 00:19:43.472
Do I look like a good runner?

00:19:43.952 --> 00:19:45.552
(Joking)

00:19:46.122 --> 00:19:48.352
- Maybe a figure skater?
- Right.

00:19:48.952 --> 00:19:50.222
Are you an optician?

00:19:51.062 --> 00:19:53.268
I have a feeling he uses lasers.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:54.892
Are you in the semiconductor industry?

00:19:55.232 --> 00:19:56.232
It's close.

00:19:57.332 --> 00:19:59.078
Maybe he deals with electric circuits.

00:19:59.102 --> 00:20:00.372
He needs those for the sparks.

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:03.772
As you said, I handle lasers,

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:07.112
and various pieces of equipment.

00:20:07.872 --> 00:20:09.632
I'm a doctor working
at an aesthetic clinic.

00:20:10.512 --> 00:20:13.242
- Seul Hye!
- Yes!

00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:14.729
(Amazed)

00:20:14.753 --> 00:20:16.258
Give her a prize.

00:20:16.282 --> 00:20:17.398
(How on earth did she guess that?)

00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:19.458
Why did you just shout, "Yes?"

00:20:19.482 --> 00:20:22.152
- I did something right, at least.
- She's done something.

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:24.722
I'm a doctor working
at an aesthetic clinic.

00:20:25.862 --> 00:20:28.392
- What?
- You're a doctor?

00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:31.508
(Genuinely surprised)

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:32.532
A dermatologist?

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.232
Excuse me?

00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:37.578
(Is this really happening?)

00:20:37.602 --> 00:20:39.218
You're a dermatologist?

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:40.348
(No one can believe what they heard.)

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.248
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

00:20:42.272 --> 00:20:43.712
(Sang Won's job surprised everyone.)

00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:46.712
I'm a doctor working
at an aesthetic clinic,

00:20:47.152 --> 00:20:48.682
Park Sang Won.

00:20:48.912 --> 00:20:50.698
He has great skin.

00:20:50.722 --> 00:20:52.298
- He's the director?
- What?

00:20:52.322 --> 00:20:53.322
Director.

00:20:53.792 --> 00:20:56.368
(He works at an aesthetic clinic
and handles overall treatments.)

00:20:56.392 --> 00:20:57.762
He looks cool all of a sudden.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:02.068
I also perform injection procedures,
such as pigmentation treatments,

00:21:02.092 --> 00:21:03.802
lifting, and fillers.

00:21:06.262 --> 00:21:08.772
I'm proud of what I do

00:21:09.172 --> 00:21:10.702
when they're happy with the result.

00:21:11.302 --> 00:21:13.072
That's a big surprise.

00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:15.688
(Park Sang Won)

00:21:15.712 --> 00:21:16.958
It suits him.

00:21:16.982 --> 00:21:18.182
(A dermatologist)

00:21:18.942 --> 00:21:20.858
He wouldn't be that young, then.

00:21:20.882 --> 00:21:23.182
(Playful Sang Won had a surprising job.)

00:21:23.552 --> 00:21:25.322
(Impressed)

00:21:25.382 --> 00:21:26.722
That's amazing.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.998
It is a surprise.

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:30.962
No one guessed it correctly.

00:21:31.922 --> 00:21:34.438
I thought his job would require

00:21:34.462 --> 00:21:36.832
an outgoing personality.

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:40.672
I was really surprised when
he said he was a doctor.

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:42.252
His job was the biggest surprise.

00:21:43.742 --> 00:21:47.518
(Another person surprised by his job)

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:49.142
I was so startled.

00:21:49.912 --> 00:21:52.012
All my guesses were wrong.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:56.112
I said he was a YouTuber.

00:21:57.552 --> 00:21:59.222
(Embarrassed)

00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:01.698
(Back to being calm)

00:22:01.722 --> 00:22:06.362
Yes. I never imagined him to be a doctor.

00:22:07.062 --> 00:22:08.092
That's cool.

00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.038
(No one expected him to be a doctor.)

00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:13.138
So, he's a doctor.

00:22:13.162 --> 00:22:15.402
(No one expected him to be a doctor.)

00:22:15.832 --> 00:22:17.048
(Two younger men have revealed their jobs.)

00:22:17.072 --> 00:22:18.242
Pick one.

00:22:19.942 --> 00:22:20.942
Is it for shooting?

00:22:22.212 --> 00:22:24.888
Or not. I wonder what this is.

00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:27.058
(A mysterious pair of
goggles came out of the Box.)

00:22:27.082 --> 00:22:28.582
There are many glasses.

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.822
There really are.

00:22:31.122 --> 00:22:32.722
Is it for making something?

00:22:32.922 --> 00:22:34.068
Glasses,

00:22:34.092 --> 00:22:36.628
- for crafting jewelry.
- It's for making jewelry.

00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:37.662
Is it?

00:22:37.762 --> 00:22:38.922
A craft worker?

00:22:39.222 --> 00:22:41.068
I bet it's one of these two.

00:22:41.092 --> 00:22:43.032
- Maybe Hyeon Jun.
- Yes, one of these two.

00:22:43.732 --> 00:22:44.802
It's mine.

00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:48.572
Is she a researcher?

00:22:49.572 --> 00:22:53.572
I'd say it's similar to jewelry.

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:57.212
I like making pretty things.

00:22:58.142 --> 00:22:59.412
In the beauty industry?

00:23:00.652 --> 00:23:01.712
What is it?

00:23:02.582 --> 00:23:06.322
It's what I use when I treat patients.

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:10.538
I make people's smiles prettier.

00:23:10.562 --> 00:23:11.662
I'm a dentist.

00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.432
She's also...

00:23:15.232 --> 00:23:16.792
So she was a dentist.

00:23:18.432 --> 00:23:20.572
There are two doctors already?

00:23:21.872 --> 00:23:24.248
I'll visit them. I'll stop
by the aesthetic clinic,

00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:25.618
- then the dental clinic.
- I'll go too.

00:23:25.642 --> 00:23:26.772
(I'll see you there.)

00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:33.928
Hello, I run a dental clinic in Gangnam.

00:23:33.952 --> 00:23:36.082
I'm Kim Yeong Gyeong, a dentist.

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:37.798
I first entered Korea University's...

00:23:37.822 --> 00:23:40.228
Department of English
Language and Literature.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:43.792
Then, I went on to
pursue a master's degree

00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:46.822
in Communication at
Seoul National University.

00:23:47.262 --> 00:23:50.908
During a spontaneous
medical volunteer trip,

00:23:50.932 --> 00:23:52.862
I was deeply moved by the experience,

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:57.172
which inspired me to study
hard to enter dental school,

00:23:57.372 --> 00:23:59.278
and eventually become a dentist.

00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:00.518
That's so cool.

00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:02.042
- Goodness.
- That's so cool.

00:24:03.112 --> 00:24:05.042
- That's admirable.
- Indeed.

00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:07.112
I bet she didn't have
any time to date guys.

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.052
Everyone's so...

00:24:12.882 --> 00:24:14.022
It suits her.

00:24:15.692 --> 00:24:18.762
We have a dentist and a dermatologist.

00:24:18.962 --> 00:24:20.508
I have two doctors sitting next to me.

00:24:20.532 --> 00:24:22.308
Seriously. Two doctors in front of me.

00:24:22.332 --> 00:24:24.538
(The two doctors sat next
to Hyeon Jun by chance.)

00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:25.732
This is a rare experience.

00:24:26.202 --> 00:24:29.302
(Who will reveal their job next?)

00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:30.842
(Curious)

00:24:32.142 --> 00:24:33.348
(Amazed)

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.972
(Exclaiming)

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:37.958
Whose item is it?

00:24:37.982 --> 00:24:39.512
(What?)

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.712
(What are they looking at?)

00:24:43.922 --> 00:24:45.528
(A flowerpot)

00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:47.552
A flowerpot? A professional gardener?

00:24:52.062 --> 00:24:53.592
I can't even guess.

00:24:54.592 --> 00:24:55.708
It was Mu Jin's?

00:24:55.732 --> 00:24:56.852
(The pot belongs to Mu Jin.)

00:24:57.302 --> 00:24:59.878
(Mu Jin and a flowerpot?)

00:24:59.902 --> 00:25:01.532
That's related to his job?

00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:03.972
What do you think my job is?

00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:05.842
A florist.

00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:07.948
A florist.

00:25:07.972 --> 00:25:09.048
(A job related to flowerpots?)

00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:10.072
A florist?

00:25:11.242 --> 00:25:12.442
Or you run a botanical garden.

00:25:13.752 --> 00:25:14.858
That's too hard to guess.

00:25:14.882 --> 00:25:15.888
(No one can guess it.)

00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:17.822
I'm most curious about that one.

00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:20.898
(No one seems to be able to guess it.)

00:25:20.922 --> 00:25:22.952
What is it?

00:25:23.252 --> 00:25:24.392
(Hesitating)

00:25:24.492 --> 00:25:26.922
I'm a public servant.

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:28.538
What?

00:25:28.562 --> 00:25:29.968
(A public servant?)

00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:31.578
That's a huge plot twist.

00:25:31.602 --> 00:25:33.802
I never expected him
to be a public servant.

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.872
I'm a public servant.

00:25:37.072 --> 00:25:39.742
(What?)

00:25:42.842 --> 00:25:44.588
(Amazed)

00:25:44.612 --> 00:25:46.882
How is that related to the flowerpot?

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:49.152
How are they connected?

00:25:49.852 --> 00:25:53.058
I work in the field of forestry
and green space management,

00:25:53.082 --> 00:25:54.422
so I brought a tree.

00:25:55.252 --> 00:25:57.422
(Fascinated)

00:25:57.992 --> 00:26:01.292
(No one guessed Mu Jin's
job would be a public servant.)

00:26:03.702 --> 00:26:07.432
I currently work at the
Environmental Forest Office.

00:26:08.232 --> 00:26:09.872
I'm mainly responsible,

00:26:10.472 --> 00:26:12.878
for handling permits required
for developing mountainous areas,

00:26:12.902 --> 00:26:14.388
such as housing sites, campgrounds,

00:26:14.412 --> 00:26:16.172
and golf courses.

00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:20.728
And I supervise and manage
those construction sites.

00:26:20.752 --> 00:26:23.052
(He also supervises
the construction sites.)

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.158
Mu Jin's job is also surprising.

00:26:25.182 --> 00:26:26.428
All their jobs are surprising.

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:27.498
That was so unexpected.

00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:29.568
- I wasn't expecting any of them.
- Me neither.

00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:30.798
(Kim Mu Jin, a public servant)

00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:32.462
He must be so popular.

00:26:36.432 --> 00:26:38.502
(Shy)

00:26:41.972 --> 00:26:43.672
I would never have guessed that.

00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:44.972
That was a surprise.

00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:46.918
- I couldn't imagine.
- It was the biggest surprise.

00:26:46.942 --> 00:26:48.512
It really was.

00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:51.512
I used to think that I had good intuition,

00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:52.882
so it surprised me.

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:56.912
I could never figure out

00:26:57.152 --> 00:26:59.652
what his job would be.

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:02.268
I want to get to know more

00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:06.662
about the person rather than his job.

00:27:06.862 --> 00:27:08.832
So, that didn't really bother me.

00:27:09.592 --> 00:27:10.578
Yes.

00:27:10.602 --> 00:27:12.432
(He became the surprise of Yeon House.)

00:27:13.062 --> 00:27:14.278
(Amazed)

00:27:14.302 --> 00:27:16.708
(Who does the fifth Job Box belong to?)

00:27:16.732 --> 00:27:18.202
It's very unique.

00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:20.248
I have no clue.

00:27:20.272 --> 00:27:21.942
(A wooden doll?)

00:27:22.772 --> 00:27:24.258
What are they? Wooden dolls?

00:27:24.282 --> 00:27:25.458
(The wooden dolls keep coming.)

00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:29.258
They must make craft work.

00:27:29.282 --> 00:27:30.458
(And a wooden black swan?)

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.752
Like dolls?

00:27:32.982 --> 00:27:34.692
Are they an artist?

00:27:35.152 --> 00:27:36.268
I'm dying to know.

00:27:36.292 --> 00:27:37.522
(An artist who makes dolls?)

00:27:38.262 --> 00:27:39.239
(Grinning)

00:27:39.263 --> 00:27:40.832
(Putting on poker face)

00:27:41.432 --> 00:27:42.438
(Her eyes are fixed on someone.)

00:27:42.462 --> 00:27:43.532
I have a guess.

00:27:44.132 --> 00:27:45.332
A nutcracker.

00:27:45.462 --> 00:27:47.002
(Turning)

00:27:47.172 --> 00:27:48.448
That's mine.

00:27:48.472 --> 00:27:50.918
(It was Ye Eun's Box.)

00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:51.972
Yes.

00:27:53.442 --> 00:27:55.188
"The Swan Lake."
- "The Swan Lake."

00:27:55.212 --> 00:27:56.518
"The Nutcracker."
- "The Nutcracker."

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.042
- Oh, I see.
- "Black Swan."

00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:02.852
I'm a principal dancer

00:28:03.412 --> 00:28:06.652
at the Korean National Ballet.

00:28:07.022 --> 00:28:08.792
That's my job.

00:28:09.322 --> 00:28:12.492
Everyone's so highly accomplished.

00:28:13.322 --> 00:28:14.862
Goodness.

00:28:16.192 --> 00:28:17.562
- She's so...
- That's so cool.

00:28:18.862 --> 00:28:20.778
I'm the principal dancer

00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:23.448
at the Korean National Ballet,

00:28:23.472 --> 00:28:25.518
who plays the lead role.

00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:26.578
(The pinnacle of a ballet career)

00:28:26.602 --> 00:28:27.848
- And she's...
- That gives me chills.

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.112
And she's the principal dancer.

00:28:30.112 --> 00:28:32.512
"The Nutcracker," "La Bayadere,."

00:28:33.682 --> 00:28:35.452
"Don Quixote," "Giselle"

00:28:35.712 --> 00:28:37.358
I've been in many pieces.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.359
(She was in "The Nutcracker," "La Bayadere,"
"Don Quixote,") ("Giselle," and "Black Swan.")

00:28:39.383 --> 00:28:40.422
That's impressive.

00:28:41.092 --> 00:28:43.962
I started doing ballet when I was five.

00:28:44.792 --> 00:28:46.992
I attended Yewon School,
Seoul Arts High School,

00:28:47.332 --> 00:28:48.932
and Korea National University of Arts.

00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:53.662
And I won the Prima
Ballerina Award in 2019.

00:28:58.442 --> 00:29:00.042
Ballet is my whole life.

00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:03.648
That's why she couldn't afford

00:29:03.672 --> 00:29:05.258
- to date guys.
- Right.

00:29:05.282 --> 00:29:06.412
(Park Ye Eun, a ballerina)

00:29:07.652 --> 00:29:08.629
(Shy)

00:29:08.653 --> 00:29:09.982
It suits her.

00:29:10.152 --> 00:29:12.058
Being a principal dancer is tough.

00:29:12.082 --> 00:29:13.128
I know.

00:29:13.152 --> 00:29:14.752
It suits her so well.

00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:17.398
That's impressive.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.038
(Still shy)

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.738
(The item in the next Job Box)

00:29:20.762 --> 00:29:21.739
(Exclaiming)

00:29:21.763 --> 00:29:22.808
Is that a Japanese knife?

00:29:22.832 --> 00:29:24.108
- A knife that's actually used.
- Is it a sashimi knife?

00:29:24.132 --> 00:29:25.302
(It's a knife?)

00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:27.162
- A chef?
- A cook.

00:29:27.372 --> 00:29:28.948
This one must be a chef.

00:29:28.972 --> 00:29:30.302
(Are they a chef?)

00:29:31.072 --> 00:29:32.702
(Grinning)

00:29:32.942 --> 00:29:34.518
(Turning his head)

00:29:34.542 --> 00:29:35.912
I think it's Hyeon Jun's.

00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:38.142
I agree.

00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:40.142
It's mine.

00:29:40.682 --> 00:29:41.782
I knew it.

00:29:41.912 --> 00:29:43.552
We guessed it correctly, didn't we?

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:45.922
I'm currently

00:29:46.682 --> 00:29:50.592
expanding my business
into the restaurant industry.

00:29:54.132 --> 00:29:56.492
I run a fusion bar, an izakaya,

00:29:56.632 --> 00:29:59.402
and a fusion Korean-style pub.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:03.072
I'm also investing in shared venues,

00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:05.742
and expanding my business.

00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:10.882
(Kim Hyeon Jun)

00:30:13.742 --> 00:30:16.852
This is a knife that I use

00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:18.522
to trim and skin fish.

00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:20.522
I brought it to cook for you.

00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:23.228
- Yes.
- We'll be able to

00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:24.592
eat delicious food.

00:30:25.592 --> 00:30:27.732
It was really surprising.

00:30:28.462 --> 00:30:30.838
(Her guess on their first date was...)

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:34.078
(that he was a gym owner.)

00:30:34.102 --> 00:30:38.872
It was a job that I had never seen coming.

00:30:39.202 --> 00:30:41.942
I can't cook at all,

00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:45.058
so he looked cool.

00:30:45.082 --> 00:30:49.482
(He looked cool.)

00:30:49.582 --> 00:30:51.528
(There are three people's
jobs left to be revealed.)

00:30:51.552 --> 00:30:53.922
(Ji Won, Bon Hee, and Ji Yung)

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:56.628
(A miniature model of a hanok?)

00:30:56.652 --> 00:30:57.792
A miniature model?

00:30:58.422 --> 00:30:59.522
Architecture?

00:30:59.822 --> 00:31:01.592
- Architect.
- Architect.

00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:04.302
There's a photo inside.

00:31:07.102 --> 00:31:08.348
(She looks at someone.)

00:31:08.372 --> 00:31:09.708
- There's a photo.
- There's a photo.

00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:10.948
It's too obvious.

00:31:10.972 --> 00:31:12.542
(Everyone naturally looks at someone.)

00:31:12.942 --> 00:31:14.572
They're mine.

00:31:16.112 --> 00:31:18.182
I have two jobs.

00:31:18.912 --> 00:31:20.318
I got my license,

00:31:20.342 --> 00:31:23.412
and am currently
preparing to be a co-pilot.

00:31:23.552 --> 00:31:25.122
(Really?)

00:31:25.322 --> 00:31:26.552
While I'm doing that,

00:31:27.122 --> 00:31:30.368
I'm running a hanok-style accommodation.

00:31:30.392 --> 00:31:31.522
What?

00:31:32.462 --> 00:31:36.192
I used to work as a
flight attendant in Korea.

00:31:37.632 --> 00:31:40.972
I thought about what I could do to improve,

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:44.642
so I went to the US
and got a pilot license.

00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:45.918
That's admirable.

00:31:45.942 --> 00:31:46.948
It's so cool.

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:48.748
I'm currently studying

00:31:48.772 --> 00:31:50.288
to get a job as a co-pilot.

00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:52.032
(She's studying to be a co-pilot in Korea.)

00:31:52.812 --> 00:31:55.682
I also run a hanok-style accommodation.

00:31:57.012 --> 00:31:59.122
I absolutely love that place.

00:31:59.722 --> 00:32:03.128
I put a lot of love into building that.

00:32:03.152 --> 00:32:04.792
(She works as hard on it as she studies.)

00:32:05.062 --> 00:32:06.398
(Park Ji Won)

00:32:06.422 --> 00:32:07.968
They're all so impressive.

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.532
(Owner of a hanok-style accommodation)

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:12.462
- Thank you.
- That's cool.

00:32:15.102 --> 00:32:17.418
Call me if you ever want to visit.

00:32:17.442 --> 00:32:18.718
- I...
- How lovely.

00:32:18.742 --> 00:32:21.912
Always organize the place nicely,

00:32:22.172 --> 00:32:25.042
so you'll feel the warmth
when you're there.

00:32:25.112 --> 00:32:26.382
I want to visit.

00:32:28.552 --> 00:32:30.512
I'm more curious about people

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.702
who have jobs that are different from mine.

00:32:33.782 --> 00:32:36.798
It fascinated me that she switched careers,

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:39.468
and I reckoned I could learn from her.

00:32:39.492 --> 00:32:42.892
It was a different type of respect.

00:32:43.692 --> 00:32:45.778
I want to get to know her better.

00:32:45.802 --> 00:32:46.978
(After the job reveal, )

00:32:47.002 --> 00:32:50.502
(did Sang Won become interested in Ji Won?)

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.872
I think I know whose this is.

00:32:53.572 --> 00:32:54.612
What?

00:32:55.742 --> 00:32:56.742
(A ball?) (Glancing)

00:32:57.743 --> 00:32:59.063
(They naturally look at one guy.)

00:33:00.282 --> 00:33:01.412
What on earth is that?

00:33:01.912 --> 00:33:03.882
"What on earth is that?"
- What is that?

00:33:04.122 --> 00:33:05.352
I'm not so sure.

00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:07.852
- It can't be anyone else.
- Right.

00:33:09.492 --> 00:33:11.322
I'm a professional rugby player

00:33:11.762 --> 00:33:13.792
in Korea.

00:33:15.662 --> 00:33:19.162
I've always loved working out.

00:33:19.532 --> 00:33:21.278
I went to college

00:33:21.302 --> 00:33:23.202
as a rugby player.

00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:27.472
I'm currently a professional rugby player.

00:33:27.612 --> 00:33:28.642
He's a pro.

00:33:29.812 --> 00:33:32.882
My position is called the flanker.

00:33:33.612 --> 00:33:35.758
It requires not only strength,

00:33:35.782 --> 00:33:38.122
but also speed.

00:33:39.982 --> 00:33:40.968
(Yang Ji Yung, a pro rugby player)

00:33:40.992 --> 00:33:42.828
You can play rugby

00:33:42.852 --> 00:33:44.922
only if you're strong and fast.

00:33:45.492 --> 00:33:46.562
Thank you.

00:33:48.662 --> 00:33:49.708
That's amazing.

00:33:49.732 --> 00:33:52.208
Throwing an oval-shaped ball is

00:33:52.232 --> 00:33:53.752
different from throwing a regular one.

00:33:53.962 --> 00:33:55.048
That's true.

00:33:55.072 --> 00:33:56.508
- Don't you use both hands?
- Yes.

00:33:56.532 --> 00:33:58.072
- You're right. Both hands.
- Right?

00:33:58.842 --> 00:34:01.018
I want to know how rugby is different

00:34:01.042 --> 00:34:02.642
- from American football.
- Oh, right.

00:34:03.012 --> 00:34:06.342
The biggest difference is that
you play football with pads on.

00:34:06.742 --> 00:34:08.382
Rugby has no pads at all.

00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:10.028
- Really?
- Just our mouth guards.

00:34:10.052 --> 00:34:12.012
Other than that, we play
without protective pads.

00:34:12.252 --> 00:34:14.322
- Do you use different balls?
- Yes.

00:34:14.592 --> 00:34:17.322
A rugby ball is bigger than a football ball.

00:34:19.592 --> 00:34:21.392
He looked like a good guy,

00:34:21.832 --> 00:34:23.538
and he was confident.

00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:27.262
So, I want to find out
what kind of person he is.

00:34:29.202 --> 00:34:30.802
She's instinctively drawn to him.

00:34:33.842 --> 00:34:35.942
Now, the long-awaited participant.

00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:38.942
- I'm so curious.
- So am I.

00:34:39.282 --> 00:34:40.342
I wonder what she does.

00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:43.159
(A poster for a drama?)

00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:44.252
What?

00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:45.998
(What?)

00:34:46.022 --> 00:34:47.028
I know what that is.

00:34:47.052 --> 00:34:48.128
That's your job?

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:49.368
(Her job is related to the
show "Youth of May?")

00:34:49.392 --> 00:34:50.598
Are you a writer?

00:34:50.622 --> 00:34:51.992
A screenwriter? An actress?

00:34:52.262 --> 00:34:53.462
A stylist?

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:59.002
I'm a photographer.

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:04.342
That's the photo I took for the poster.

00:35:04.872 --> 00:35:06.072
Oh, right.

00:35:06.672 --> 00:35:08.288
(Glancing)

00:35:08.312 --> 00:35:10.812
(How does she look when she's working?)

00:35:11.612 --> 00:35:13.182
I never imagined it.

00:35:13.542 --> 00:35:15.382
My gosh. I had no idea
she was a photographer.

00:35:16.312 --> 00:35:18.722
I run a photo studio.

00:35:21.692 --> 00:35:24.052
I take photos for fashion
magazines and fashion look books.

00:35:24.092 --> 00:35:27.498
I also make drama posters
and take profile photos

00:35:27.522 --> 00:35:28.892
of actors and models.

00:35:32.202 --> 00:35:33.708
As for drama posters,

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:36.008
the poster of "Youth of
May" was my first work,

00:35:36.032 --> 00:35:38.872
and since then, I've been making
various types of drama posters.

00:35:38.942 --> 00:35:40.272
Really?

00:35:42.012 --> 00:35:43.242
It's just so hard to believe.

00:35:43.972 --> 00:35:45.412
Everyone's occupation is unexpected.

00:35:45.912 --> 00:35:46.982
She's so cool.

00:35:47.652 --> 00:35:49.082
(Shy)

00:35:51.422 --> 00:35:52.422
That's cool.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:55.468
My, that's really cool.

00:35:55.492 --> 00:35:57.722
She really is an attractive person.

00:35:58.562 --> 00:35:59.562
Sang Hyeon...

00:36:01.732 --> 00:36:03.168
She took photos of me,

00:36:03.192 --> 00:36:06.232
and said that she liked to take photos.

00:36:08.532 --> 00:36:11.742
I found it great that she's making money

00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:13.578
from what she likes.

00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:16.572
(I found it great.)

00:36:16.972 --> 00:36:18.858
Everyone's job is fascinating.

00:36:18.882 --> 00:36:21.528
Everyone has a cool job.

00:36:21.552 --> 00:36:23.192
(They've all revealed their occupations.)

00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:27.968
(Did it change the feelings...)

00:36:27.992 --> 00:36:29.428
(of the older women and the younger men?)

00:36:29.452 --> 00:36:30.692
I wonder how things will go.

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.362
This is fun.

00:36:35.962 --> 00:36:38.732
I think the women
were a little bit worried

00:36:39.062 --> 00:36:42.178
about the guys' career statuses.

00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:44.972
- "What if they're students?"
- That's what worried them.

00:36:45.372 --> 00:36:48.048
But we have a doctor, a
civil servant, and so on.

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:49.142
They're amazing.

00:36:49.942 --> 00:36:54.158
Will knowing one another's
job affect the relationships

00:36:54.182 --> 00:36:56.412
between the women and
the guys? What do you think?

00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:57.728
- I think it will.
- Definitely.

00:36:57.752 --> 00:36:58.828
- Definitely?
- Yes, definitely.

00:36:58.852 --> 00:36:59.928
- I think it'll have an influence.
- Right.

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:02.228
Until now, there seemed to be
romance between the couples

00:37:02.252 --> 00:37:03.622
who spent time together.

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:05.638
But Yeong Gyeong said

00:37:05.662 --> 00:37:07.732
she wanted to talk more with Sang Hyeon.

00:37:07.832 --> 00:37:10.568
And Sang Won found Bon Hee and Ji Won

00:37:10.592 --> 00:37:13.402
great and respectable.
Based on what they said,

00:37:13.462 --> 00:37:15.478
I think that revealing
their jobs could change

00:37:15.502 --> 00:37:17.232
some of the relationships.

00:37:17.272 --> 00:37:18.342
- I agree.
- Right.

00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:20.418
This might sound snobbish,

00:37:20.442 --> 00:37:22.918
but when Sang Won said
he was a dermatologist,

00:37:22.942 --> 00:37:24.682
he suddenly looked more handsome.

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.558
It's a natural reaction.

00:37:26.582 --> 00:37:27.888
- I felt the same way.
- I saw "Director" on his badge,

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.558
- and thought he was so cool.
- To be honest, I felt the same way.

00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:31.428
- Right?
- Becoming a director is not easy.

00:37:31.452 --> 00:37:32.922
- Exactly.
- He's competent.

00:37:38.792 --> 00:37:42.332
(After the occupation revelation,
Ji Yung receives a message.)

00:37:43.092 --> 00:37:45.932
(You can take someone
out on a late-night date.)

00:37:46.232 --> 00:37:47.808
(Ask the older woman
you like out on a date.)

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:50.448
- A late-night date?
- He just got here.

00:37:50.472 --> 00:37:52.218
- I wonder whom he'll pick.
- Where will they go at this hour?

00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:54.242
(Glancing)

00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:58.082
It looks like I have to choose
one person to go on a date with me.

00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:00.888
- He'll go on a date right away?
- I'm getting nervous.

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:02.082
Really? Just like this?

00:38:04.082 --> 00:38:05.422
- The time has come.
- My gosh.

00:38:08.092 --> 00:38:10.022
(Pressing his lips together)

00:38:10.892 --> 00:38:12.592
(Glancing)

00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:14.992
(Looking nervously)

00:38:16.132 --> 00:38:20.832
(There's a subtle tension
in the air for a moment.)

00:38:21.072 --> 00:38:22.078
(Whom will Ji Yung ask out on a date?)

00:38:22.102 --> 00:38:23.602
I'm so curious who he will choose.

00:38:24.672 --> 00:38:26.672
I want to talk to Ji Yung.

00:38:29.212 --> 00:38:30.218
(Nervous)

00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:31.442
They must be so nervous.

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:41.222
(Which of the older women
does Ji Yung want to go out with?)

00:38:42.392 --> 00:38:43.422
I will...

00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.548
(Whom will Ji Yung ask out on a date?)

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:46.071
I'm so curious who he will choose.

00:38:46.813 --> 00:38:48.753
I want to talk to Ji Yung.

00:38:51.353 --> 00:38:52.359
(Nervous)

00:38:52.383 --> 00:38:53.553
They must be so nervous.

00:38:57.263 --> 00:39:03.263
(Which of the older women
does Ji Yung want to go out with?)

00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:05.463
I will

00:39:06.703 --> 00:39:07.703
I will

00:39:09.833 --> 00:39:13.473
take Ms. Gu Bon Hee out on a date.

00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.643
(Ji Yung chose Bon Hee.)

00:39:16.773 --> 00:39:19.083
- Have a good time with him.
- I will.

00:39:23.083 --> 00:39:24.823
(Looking at Mu Jin nervously)

00:39:25.653 --> 00:39:28.569
(Mu Jin became quiet.)

00:39:28.593 --> 00:39:29.893
This is bad.

00:39:36.093 --> 00:39:38.133
Sang Hyeon is pressing his lips together.

00:39:39.863 --> 00:39:41.133
She doesn't look happy.

00:39:43.743 --> 00:39:45.773
It bothers me a little bit, to be honest.

00:39:48.773 --> 00:39:51.889
Honestly, I'm trying not
to let the others know,

00:39:51.913 --> 00:39:54.113
but I do feel jealous.

00:39:54.153 --> 00:39:55.913
Seeing the man who newly joined us

00:39:56.453 --> 00:39:58.293
take Bon Hee out on a
date as soon as he came,

00:39:59.223 --> 00:40:02.429
I thought I should do
something to win her heart.

00:40:02.453 --> 00:40:04.293
And that made me think of her even more.

00:40:05.323 --> 00:40:08.693
I think my feelings for her are growing.

00:40:11.933 --> 00:40:13.879
- I'll go get my bag and come down.
- Okay.

00:40:13.903 --> 00:40:16.143
(What change will Ji Yung's
choice bring to Yeon House?)

00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:17.443
This is so fun to watch.

00:40:18.073 --> 00:40:20.273
Can you give us some popcorn?

00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:21.689
I want to have some
snacks while watching it.

00:40:21.713 --> 00:40:24.359
If you receive that kind of message,

00:40:24.383 --> 00:40:26.859
would you ask her out in a private place?

00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:29.089
Or would you just say
it in front of everyone?

00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:30.523
Exactly. It's hard to answer.

00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:33.183
I would need about two hours.

00:40:33.753 --> 00:40:34.769
- What?
- What would you do in two hours?

00:40:34.793 --> 00:40:36.499
- You need time to think?
- He asked what you would do.

00:40:36.523 --> 00:40:37.999
"What would you do in two hours?"

00:40:38.023 --> 00:40:39.739
I would need everyone else to leave.

00:40:39.763 --> 00:40:41.169
(He needs time to wait
until the others leave.)

00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:42.709
That would help me relieve nervousness.

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:43.979
(He also needs time to get ready mentally.)

00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:46.284
When I'm ready, I'd carry her
over my shoulder and leave.

00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:49.003
(I'm dumbfounded.)

00:40:49.173 --> 00:40:52.873
If I were him... Since I'm
going out on a late-night date,

00:40:53.043 --> 00:40:55.349
I'd choose someone quickly
and leave to save time.

00:40:55.373 --> 00:40:56.543
(Oh, my. I knew it!)

00:40:56.843 --> 00:40:58.983
(SOOBIN is tender
outside, but tough inside.)

00:40:59.643 --> 00:41:02.653
(As Ji Yung chose her, Bon
Hee prepares for the date.)

00:41:04.383 --> 00:41:06.123
Bon Hee.

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:09.523
- I'll get going.
- Have a good time.

00:41:10.323 --> 00:41:11.643
- I'm sure it'll be fun.
- Right.

00:41:11.893 --> 00:41:13.693
(Jealous)

00:41:14.663 --> 00:41:17.279
Mu Jin seemed upset for some reason.

00:41:17.303 --> 00:41:18.709
- Right now?
- Earlier

00:41:18.733 --> 00:41:20.373
when Ji Yung asked you out.

00:41:20.703 --> 00:41:22.179
- Did you see his facial expression?
- Am I the only one who felt that?

00:41:22.203 --> 00:41:23.819
- I saw him from the side...
- How did you see his face?

00:41:23.843 --> 00:41:24.883
I looked at him like this.

00:41:25.143 --> 00:41:28.473
When Ji Yung chose you, I
turned around to see his face.

00:41:29.273 --> 00:41:30.343
Like this.

00:41:31.843 --> 00:41:32.883
Good luck.

00:41:33.143 --> 00:41:34.759
- I'll get going.
- Have fun.

00:41:34.783 --> 00:41:36.313
- Okay. I'll be off now.
- Okay.

00:41:45.793 --> 00:41:46.963
Ji Won seemed

00:41:47.493 --> 00:41:50.263
to be interested in Ji Yung,
but she spoke so cheerfully.

00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:53.009
- You know, she told Bon Hee...
- Right.

00:41:53.033 --> 00:41:54.179
- How Mu Jin seemed upset.
- Exactly.

00:41:54.203 --> 00:41:56.149
- I wonder what that means.
- They must be close.

00:41:56.173 --> 00:41:57.349
She wanted to tell Bon Hee in a subtle way,

00:41:57.373 --> 00:42:00.273
"You haven't forgotten Mu Jin, have you?"

00:42:01.073 --> 00:42:03.119
What she said had this
kind of nuance subtly.

00:42:03.143 --> 00:42:04.919
If that's the case, it means

00:42:04.943 --> 00:42:08.029
she said that to Bon Hee
to sabotage their date.

00:42:08.053 --> 00:42:09.659
- It's sort of a strategy.
- I wouldn't

00:42:09.683 --> 00:42:11.759
I wouldn't say she tried
to sabotage their date.

00:42:11.783 --> 00:42:14.999
- I don't know.
- She couldn't help being jealous.

00:42:15.023 --> 00:42:18.123
So she wanted to know if
Bon Hee was happy about it,

00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:20.763
or didn't care so much
that she had been chosen.

00:42:20.863 --> 00:42:22.669
She tried to see what was going on.

00:42:22.693 --> 00:42:24.709
(Did Ji Won say it intentionally
as she was interested in Ji Yung?)

00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:25.710
(Meanwhile, in the guys' room)

00:42:25.734 --> 00:42:27.134
You should get changed and go down.

00:42:27.173 --> 00:42:29.009
She must be waiting
for you on the third floor.

00:42:29.033 --> 00:42:30.010
- Really?
- Yes.

00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:32.303
- Then I'll get going.
- Okay.

00:42:32.403 --> 00:42:34.673
- Have a great time.
- I'll see you guys later.

00:42:37.313 --> 00:42:38.913
- Okay.
- It was cut nicely.

00:42:39.213 --> 00:42:40.219
- Come in.
- Come in.

00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:41.229
(Ji Yung came to pick up Bon Hee.)

00:42:41.253 --> 00:42:42.453
I'll be off.

00:42:42.553 --> 00:42:43.783
Have fun.

00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:48.029
- You must be tired.
- I'm fine.

00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:50.739
- Are you?
- She must be taken aback.

00:42:50.763 --> 00:42:53.199
Only a few hours after Ji
Yung came to the house,

00:42:53.223 --> 00:42:55.509
he chose her based on
his first impression of her.

00:42:55.533 --> 00:42:57.109
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung are
going out on a late-night date.)

00:42:57.133 --> 00:42:59.133
- Aren't you cold? Are you?
- No, I'm fine.

00:42:59.763 --> 00:43:01.233
The weather became cool.

00:43:01.473 --> 00:43:02.473
It's really nice.

00:43:03.103 --> 00:43:05.773
(With a refreshing autumn
breeze, they go on a late-night date.)

00:43:05.843 --> 00:43:06.943
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

00:43:10.273 --> 00:43:13.543
- Your car suits you too.
- Really?

00:43:18.123 --> 00:43:19.353
(Glancing)

00:43:20.423 --> 00:43:21.599
Have you ever heard

00:43:21.623 --> 00:43:22.829
- a name called "Ji Yung?"
- It's my first time.

00:43:22.853 --> 00:43:24.339
- You've never heard of the name?
- No.

00:43:24.363 --> 00:43:25.869
I don't think I've ever heard the name...

00:43:25.893 --> 00:43:27.463
- "Bon Hee." Yes.
- Is that so?

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:30.409
There's an easy way to remember my name.

00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:31.673
Oh, what is it? Please tell me.

00:43:33.003 --> 00:43:34.133
Globe-Bon Hee.

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:35.610
(Laughing)

00:43:35.634 --> 00:43:37.634
- I see. "Globe-Bon Hee."
- What-To-Watch-Bon Hee.

00:43:37.903 --> 00:43:39.743
My friends gave me those nicknames.

00:43:40.303 --> 00:43:43.519
Could you tell that I was an
athlete when you first saw me?

00:43:43.543 --> 00:43:46.359
I thought I was good at guessing.

00:43:46.383 --> 00:43:47.913
- But I couldn't guess.
- Right.

00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:49.889
But I had no idea you
could be a rugby player.

00:43:49.913 --> 00:43:51.599
Right. That's natural.

00:43:51.623 --> 00:43:52.753
It's an unfamiliar sport.

00:43:53.783 --> 00:43:55.153
It's really fun.

00:43:55.353 --> 00:43:56.823
I want to see you play rugby.

00:43:57.463 --> 00:43:59.963
I brought a rugby ball. I'll
show you how to play rugby.

00:44:00.633 --> 00:44:01.933
- Really?
- Yes.

00:44:02.463 --> 00:44:03.469
Sounds great.

00:44:03.493 --> 00:44:05.533
(They even planned their
second date so naturally?)

00:44:05.903 --> 00:44:07.733
(Hesitating)

00:44:09.873 --> 00:44:11.419
When you first came,

00:44:11.443 --> 00:44:13.913
did you see anyone who
suited your preferences?

00:44:14.413 --> 00:44:16.413
- When I first came?
- Yes. Or...

00:44:17.383 --> 00:44:20.583
Before that, what's your ideal type?

00:44:20.713 --> 00:44:23.453
He's trying to get to know
her. He needs to catch up.

00:44:23.553 --> 00:44:26.053
I like a man who is caring,

00:44:26.553 --> 00:44:28.293
and has a sense of responsibility.

00:44:30.623 --> 00:44:32.739
And I like a man who likes linen.

00:44:32.763 --> 00:44:35.469
- Sorry?
- Linen. It's a type of fabric.

00:44:35.493 --> 00:44:37.439
- Oh, I see. You mean, clothes?
- Yes.

00:44:37.463 --> 00:44:39.933
Right. When I choose what to wear,

00:44:40.403 --> 00:44:42.633
I choose linen clothes very often.

00:44:43.373 --> 00:44:46.213
(He flirts with her unexpectedly
while talking about linen.) Oh, really?

00:44:46.673 --> 00:44:47.673
(Chuckling)

00:44:47.873 --> 00:44:49.643
That's cute. I like it
when a man does that.

00:44:49.913 --> 00:44:52.419
- That can be an icebreaker.
- That's not good.

00:44:52.443 --> 00:44:54.813
Dad jokes work in that phase.

00:44:54.913 --> 00:44:56.929
Seul Hye, do you find his
comment boring and predictable?

00:44:56.953 --> 00:44:58.799
- I really like it.
- I like it too.

00:44:58.823 --> 00:45:00.259
- It lightened the mood.
- I really like it. Exactly.

00:45:00.283 --> 00:45:01.423
Are they in Dongdaemun?

00:45:02.753 --> 00:45:04.723
What are you talking about?

00:45:05.123 --> 00:45:08.039
That's cute. He's such a muscular man,

00:45:08.063 --> 00:45:10.833
- but he makes a cute joke.
- Right. That was a cute joke.

00:45:11.203 --> 00:45:13.683
It's not easy to make such a
joke when you first meet a woman.

00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:17.619
You met all four guys yesterday.

00:45:17.643 --> 00:45:18.643
Yes.

00:45:18.903 --> 00:45:21.243
Did you find any of them attractive?

00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:22.613
Yes.

00:45:23.113 --> 00:45:25.219
(Surprised)

00:45:25.243 --> 00:45:28.013
Did he seem the most
warm-hearted and caring?

00:45:29.413 --> 00:45:31.983
I think he's quite attentive.

00:45:33.023 --> 00:45:34.693
I'm not attentive.

00:45:36.393 --> 00:45:39.563
But I'm caring. Very much so.

00:45:40.323 --> 00:45:41.663
Although I look like this...

00:45:42.793 --> 00:45:44.153
What's wrong with your appearance?

00:45:44.763 --> 00:45:48.049
You mean, you look manly?
Is that what you mean?

00:45:48.073 --> 00:45:49.073
(Nodding)

00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:52.473
Isn't a person with unexpected
charms more attractive?

00:45:53.973 --> 00:45:55.613
He's very manly,

00:45:55.713 --> 00:45:58.343
and at the same time, I
see playfulness in his eyes.

00:45:58.983 --> 00:46:00.019
- We're here.
- Really?

00:46:00.043 --> 00:46:02.443
(They arrived at the destination
for their late-night date!)

00:46:03.483 --> 00:46:04.623
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

00:46:10.553 --> 00:46:11.923
(Impressed)

00:46:13.563 --> 00:46:16.369
(A fire gazing cafe where
you can enjoy camping vibes)

00:46:16.393 --> 00:46:17.609
It's atmospheric.

00:46:17.633 --> 00:46:20.363
(A fire gazing cafe where
you can enjoy camping vibes)

00:46:23.403 --> 00:46:25.103
(Amazed)

00:46:26.973 --> 00:46:28.043
Isn't it too hot?

00:46:28.343 --> 00:46:29.489
- It's warm.
- Is it?

00:46:29.513 --> 00:46:30.943
- It's perfect.
- Is it?

00:46:32.213 --> 00:46:34.093
I didn't know there was
such a place like this.

00:46:34.183 --> 00:46:35.783
(Fascinated)

00:46:35.853 --> 00:46:37.823
I really like to sit by a campfire.

00:46:39.823 --> 00:46:40.893
It's romantic.

00:46:41.223 --> 00:46:42.423
Look at the moon.

00:46:45.123 --> 00:46:46.363
It's so bright.

00:46:47.193 --> 00:46:49.163
The weather is really nice today.

00:46:50.903 --> 00:46:55.333
Was there a particular
reason you picked me?

00:46:57.673 --> 00:46:59.873
You seemed to respond
actively to what the others said.

00:47:00.403 --> 00:47:02.013
And I liked your voice.

00:47:02.573 --> 00:47:04.543
That's why I chose you.

00:47:05.043 --> 00:47:07.483
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

00:47:07.913 --> 00:47:08.913
(Chuckling)

00:47:14.253 --> 00:47:17.199
By the way, you have such good skin.

00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:18.239
- Does it look good?
- Yes.

00:47:18.263 --> 00:47:21.533
- Really?
- You didn't seem much older

00:47:23.263 --> 00:47:25.139
- I don't look much older than you?
- You didn't seem that way.

00:47:25.163 --> 00:47:26.509
That's the most common pickup line.

00:47:26.533 --> 00:47:27.603
(Shy)

00:47:28.803 --> 00:47:31.173
I think it's because we dress
well and are good at makeup.

00:47:31.573 --> 00:47:33.973
I try my best to make
myself look good every day.

00:47:37.343 --> 00:47:39.823
I don't know how old you are,
but I know I'm younger than you.

00:47:39.883 --> 00:47:43.113
Have you ever dated a younger man before?

00:47:45.423 --> 00:47:46.883
- Once.
- Once?

00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:52.263
How many relationships
have you been in before?

00:47:52.363 --> 00:47:53.399
How many relationships have I been in?

00:47:53.423 --> 00:47:54.583
(She's slightly taken aback.)

00:47:58.733 --> 00:48:00.363
I don't have much dating experience.

00:48:00.803 --> 00:48:02.573
Is it because of work?

00:48:03.373 --> 00:48:05.973
I haven't dated in a very long time

00:48:06.673 --> 00:48:08.433
since I started my
career as a photographer.

00:48:09.013 --> 00:48:11.383
I haven't dated anyone in 4 or 5 years.

00:48:13.713 --> 00:48:16.983
- Why do you think...
- Yes?

00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:20.653
Ji Yung asked her about
her dating experience?

00:48:21.693 --> 00:48:23.793
Wouldn't you be purely curious about it?

00:48:23.893 --> 00:48:27.463
I'd ask her how many
relationships she's been in also.

00:48:27.563 --> 00:48:29.039
Why would you be purely curious about that?

00:48:29.063 --> 00:48:33.239
I think it could help me guess her age.

00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:35.579
(That makes sense.)

00:48:35.603 --> 00:48:37.149
So it's to gather information?

00:48:37.173 --> 00:48:38.150
You're right.

00:48:38.174 --> 00:48:39.349
Right. I think SOOBIN is right.

00:48:39.373 --> 00:48:40.379
(I think he has a point.)

00:48:40.403 --> 00:48:43.913
I didn't think there could
be such a specific intention.

00:48:44.283 --> 00:48:46.883
(But that may not be the case.)

00:48:47.413 --> 00:48:49.853
Before you start a relationship with a guy,

00:48:50.383 --> 00:48:52.063
do you take time to get to know him? Or...

00:48:52.423 --> 00:48:55.293
Yes, I do. I spend a lot of
time getting to know him.

00:48:56.123 --> 00:48:58.463
- You spend a lot of time?
- Yes.

00:48:58.723 --> 00:48:59.839
(Thinking)

00:48:59.863 --> 00:49:01.169
I would talk to him on the phone,

00:49:01.193 --> 00:49:05.263
and go out on dates with him
before starting a relationship.

00:49:06.103 --> 00:49:08.603
I met them for quite long
before starting to date them.

00:49:09.003 --> 00:49:10.003
Until now?

00:49:10.233 --> 00:49:12.619
So she spends much time with a
guy before starting a relationship.

00:49:12.643 --> 00:49:13.743
I'm the opposite of you.

00:49:15.013 --> 00:49:16.013
- I see.
- I tend to

00:49:18.283 --> 00:49:21.413
I've been this way until now.

00:49:23.653 --> 00:49:25.853
I always fell for someone

00:49:26.783 --> 00:49:30.653
after talking to her for a
while and started dating her.

00:49:31.223 --> 00:49:32.263
Until now.

00:49:32.793 --> 00:49:35.669
Are you a straightforward
type, or do you take time

00:49:35.693 --> 00:49:38.479
- I think I'm straightforward.
- I see.

00:49:38.503 --> 00:49:40.009
- You express your feelings.
- Yes.

00:49:40.033 --> 00:49:42.473
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung have
completely opposite dating styles.)

00:49:43.003 --> 00:49:44.703
(She nods without saying anything.)

00:49:45.143 --> 00:49:46.973
I think I know why it
takes me so much time.

00:49:47.403 --> 00:49:49.113
It's hard for me to meet a guy.

00:49:49.613 --> 00:49:50.613
You mean, dating a guy?

00:49:51.543 --> 00:49:52.889
It's so hard for me to start a relationship.

00:49:52.913 --> 00:49:54.329
(Bon Hee finds it hard to start love.)

00:49:54.353 --> 00:49:56.273
My chances of developing
feelings for someone

00:49:56.583 --> 00:49:59.299
is almost the same as my
chances of winning a lottery.

00:49:59.323 --> 00:50:00.683
- Really?
- That's how I feel now.

00:50:03.653 --> 00:50:04.869
(At the same time, Yeon House)

00:50:04.893 --> 00:50:07.193
I wonder how the rest
are doing at the house.

00:50:07.663 --> 00:50:08.663
(Sighing)

00:50:09.933 --> 00:50:13.233
(Mu Jin is left alone in the room.)

00:50:14.573 --> 00:50:18.373
(Thinking)

00:50:22.013 --> 00:50:23.249
He doesn't look happy.

00:50:23.273 --> 00:50:25.233
(He's pacing back and
forth with a worried face.)

00:50:26.883 --> 00:50:29.483
(Thinking)

00:50:32.683 --> 00:50:34.053
(Sighing)

00:50:37.223 --> 00:50:38.663
(Sighing)

00:50:38.723 --> 00:50:40.569
(Mu Jin watches out the
window waiting for someone?)

00:50:40.593 --> 00:50:42.493
Oh, no. I feel bad for Mu Jin.

00:50:45.403 --> 00:50:46.380
I'll do it.

00:50:46.404 --> 00:50:48.149
(Meanwhile, Sang Won and
Hyeon Jun are in the kitchen.)

00:50:48.173 --> 00:50:49.449
You're going to make fried rice for us.

00:50:49.473 --> 00:50:52.849
Shall I make fried rice? I was
going to make stir-fried mushrooms.

00:50:52.873 --> 00:50:54.793
That sounds great. I'll
stay and watch you cook.

00:50:54.843 --> 00:50:55.820
He's a chef.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:59.083
Now that everyone knows his job,
he can show off his cooking skills.

00:50:59.343 --> 00:51:01.229
The others will see how charming he is.

00:51:01.253 --> 00:51:02.253
(Impressed)

00:51:03.253 --> 00:51:05.153
- Shall I call everyone here?
- No.

00:51:05.353 --> 00:51:06.899
- I'll tell them to come down.
- No, don't do that.

00:51:06.923 --> 00:51:07.900
Please wait.

00:51:07.924 --> 00:51:09.229
(I'll watch him cook with
everyone since it's cool.)

00:51:09.253 --> 00:51:11.193
(Rushing)

00:51:15.463 --> 00:51:16.909
(He stops.)

00:51:16.933 --> 00:51:18.239
- Oh, boy.
- Why?

00:51:18.263 --> 00:51:19.263
(Turning)

00:51:20.063 --> 00:51:21.649
(They tiptoe around each other.)

00:51:21.673 --> 00:51:24.373
Do you want to go and take a look?

00:51:24.743 --> 00:51:25.720
He spoke to her.

00:51:25.744 --> 00:51:28.219
What do you say? Hyeon
Jun is cooking for us.

00:51:28.243 --> 00:51:30.203
- He's cooking now.
- He mustered up his courage.

00:51:30.373 --> 00:51:32.093
- He's cooking for us.
- What is he making?

00:51:32.383 --> 00:51:34.283
Stir-fried mushrooms and meat.

00:51:35.213 --> 00:51:36.229
He already started cooking.

00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:39.483
(Ye Eun follows Sang Won
upon hearing the news.)

00:51:43.323 --> 00:51:44.323
I did it.

00:51:47.123 --> 00:51:48.733
Please sit. Let's watch him comfortably.

00:51:49.833 --> 00:51:50.863
He's doing well.

00:51:51.103 --> 00:51:54.773
(Ye Eun laughs again.)

00:51:55.533 --> 00:51:57.703
(Cutting)

00:51:58.673 --> 00:52:00.643
- He uses a knife differently.
- Exactly.

00:52:02.613 --> 00:52:05.059
- Thank goodness I'm not cooking.
- Do you want to see me use a knife?

00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:06.083
Exactly.

00:52:06.443 --> 00:52:08.323
You acted like a surgeon
when you were with me.

00:52:08.713 --> 00:52:10.153
Right? It's okay.

00:52:10.953 --> 00:52:13.623
(They had a date at the
makgeolli-making workshop.)

00:52:14.123 --> 00:52:15.100
(Scalpel, please.)

00:52:15.124 --> 00:52:16.523
(Chuckling)

00:52:16.623 --> 00:52:17.899
(Are you really a doctor?)

00:52:17.923 --> 00:52:19.599
It turned out that he was
the one who was a doctor.

00:52:19.623 --> 00:52:20.963
- Right.
- That's right.

00:52:23.193 --> 00:52:25.909
- It's okay. I also...
- I'm sorry.

00:52:25.933 --> 00:52:27.579
- I also... Don't be.
- I apologize.

00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:30.279
I bragged to the chef
that I made good suyuk.

00:52:30.303 --> 00:52:33.603
Ye Eun gave him a
light physical touch again.

00:52:34.203 --> 00:52:35.943
She touched his knee.

00:52:36.043 --> 00:52:38.819
- She must be feeling better now.
- They get along well again.

00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:40.683
- Right.
- They're relaxed with each other.

00:52:40.743 --> 00:52:41.759
Scalpel, please.

00:52:41.783 --> 00:52:44.383
(Ye Eun must be feeling
better now. She keeps laughing.)

00:52:44.723 --> 00:52:47.429
(Right then, Mu Jin appears
while they're laughing.)

00:52:47.453 --> 00:52:49.023
I almost made a big mistake.

00:52:49.323 --> 00:52:50.929
I noticed it because you
moved your hand downward.

00:52:50.953 --> 00:52:54.339
(He still seems troubled.)

00:52:54.363 --> 00:52:56.869
(Thinking hard)

00:52:56.893 --> 00:52:59.633
I wonder if Bon Hee and Ji Yung

00:52:59.903 --> 00:53:01.803
will eat something before coming back.

00:53:02.603 --> 00:53:04.473
- They must be eating now.
- Probably.

00:53:05.273 --> 00:53:07.833
I'm sure they're doing something
other than just taking a drive.

00:53:09.613 --> 00:53:11.489
I think they went to a
cafe that opens until late.

00:53:11.513 --> 00:53:12.713
Like a 24-hour cafe?

00:53:14.143 --> 00:53:15.503
I think they went to a large cafe.

00:53:16.453 --> 00:53:19.559
- He can hear their conversation.
- There are many cafes around here.

00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:21.199
- But he can't join them.
- I wonder where they went.

00:53:21.223 --> 00:53:22.923
- He can't respond either.
- Oh, no.

00:53:23.123 --> 00:53:25.923
Mu Jin must be frustrated now.

00:53:27.723 --> 00:53:28.793
Shall we take it upstairs?

00:53:29.563 --> 00:53:30.863
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

00:53:32.633 --> 00:53:35.233
(The stir-fried mushrooms
and meat that Hyeon Jun made)

00:53:36.233 --> 00:53:37.233
(Munching)

00:53:37.943 --> 00:53:39.943
- I think that's right.
- This is really good.

00:53:40.373 --> 00:53:41.733
- I think it was there.
- Amazing.

00:53:42.673 --> 00:53:43.943
You can't say it's not good.

00:53:44.043 --> 00:53:45.543
What did you put in here?

00:53:46.013 --> 00:53:49.213
I put in oyster sauce,
soy sauce, and sugar.

00:53:49.483 --> 00:53:51.523
- It's way better than the stew.
- He helped me.

00:53:51.883 --> 00:53:54.323
(Smiling from ear to ear)

00:53:54.893 --> 00:53:56.869
- I'm relieved you all like it.
- I'm so happy.

00:53:56.893 --> 00:53:58.613
- This is really tasty.
- Indeed. - I mean it.

00:53:59.123 --> 00:54:00.263
Can we have some more?

00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:01.609
Sure. I can make some more.

00:54:01.633 --> 00:54:03.269
- Please make some more.
- Please do.

00:54:03.293 --> 00:54:05.579
- I'll make some for them too.
- It's really good.

00:54:05.603 --> 00:54:07.283
So that they can try it when they're back.

00:54:08.503 --> 00:54:10.403
I wonder how far they went.

00:54:12.173 --> 00:54:13.473
- I'm curious.
- I'm curious.

00:54:14.613 --> 00:54:16.849
- It's late, so...
- The roads would be empty,

00:54:16.873 --> 00:54:18.489
so they might have gone far.

00:54:18.513 --> 00:54:20.433
- To see the night view.
- The roads were empty.

00:54:20.513 --> 00:54:22.289
- The night view...
- Why is Mu Jin so quiet?

00:54:22.313 --> 00:54:23.889
He hasn't said a word.

00:54:23.913 --> 00:54:25.323
He's gone quiet.

00:54:25.423 --> 00:54:27.323
They must have gone quite far.

00:54:28.753 --> 00:54:29.999
(Moving his fingers)

00:54:30.023 --> 00:54:31.263
Mu Jin is shaken.

00:54:31.793 --> 00:54:33.023
Mu Jin is shaken.

00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:35.769
- Sang Hyeon too?
- He's quiet too.

00:54:35.793 --> 00:54:37.809
(They can't stop thinking
about Bon Hee or Ji Yung.)

00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:39.273
I can just say it and get yelled at.

00:54:39.463 --> 00:54:40.679
I'm used to getting yelled at.

00:54:40.703 --> 00:54:41.879
(Some are happy, )

00:54:41.903 --> 00:54:43.933
I get yelled at all the time.

00:54:44.543 --> 00:54:45.619
So funny.

00:54:45.643 --> 00:54:47.873
(and others are heavy-hearted.)

00:54:53.943 --> 00:54:59.283
(Bon Hee and Ji Yung return from the date.)

00:54:59.883 --> 00:55:02.123
- Well done.
- Well done.

00:55:02.953 --> 00:55:05.293
- I had a lot of fun today.
- I will see you tomorrow.

00:55:09.893 --> 00:55:11.203
You're all here.

00:55:11.403 --> 00:55:12.509
Right.

00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:14.003
Right, it's...

00:55:14.133 --> 00:55:15.403
You're all here.

00:55:15.733 --> 00:55:16.833
Come join us.

00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:18.349
We've been waiting for you.

00:55:18.373 --> 00:55:19.543
Were you?

00:55:19.943 --> 00:55:21.103
Look at him.

00:55:24.143 --> 00:55:25.743
- Oh, dear.
- Poor Mu Jin.

00:55:25.883 --> 00:55:27.559
- He was waiting.
- Look at him smiling.

00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:29.189
- Oh, dear.
- Look at his arms.

00:55:29.213 --> 00:55:30.489
He's comforting himself.

00:55:30.513 --> 00:55:32.283
- Oh, dear.
- "You're okay now."

00:55:33.323 --> 00:55:34.329
"You're okay."

00:55:34.353 --> 00:55:35.529
(Bon Hee is here.)

00:55:35.553 --> 00:55:37.233
- He's transparent.
- He's staring at her.

00:55:37.693 --> 00:55:38.963
Did you cook?

00:55:38.993 --> 00:55:41.063
- We used up everything.
- Stir-fried noodles?

00:55:41.233 --> 00:55:42.593
Stir-fried noodles and...

00:55:43.063 --> 00:55:44.509
- What should we call it?
- Meat.

00:55:44.533 --> 00:55:45.763
Stir-fried meat.

00:55:47.203 --> 00:55:49.273
- How was it? Where did you go?
- How was it?

00:55:50.273 --> 00:55:51.949
- We went to a cafe.
- Did you eat anything?

00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:53.803
There was a cafe open this late?

00:55:54.273 --> 00:55:56.554
We went to a cafe where you
can watch the fire and relax.

00:55:57.273 --> 00:55:59.259
(Impressed)

00:55:59.283 --> 00:56:01.659
- They got us a cake, but we...
- He's staring at her eyes.

00:56:01.683 --> 00:56:03.353
(Mu Jin's gaze is fixed on Bon Hee.)

00:56:03.483 --> 00:56:04.559
Do you want to eat something?

00:56:04.583 --> 00:56:07.099
- I think she will eat.
- But he must be the one starving.

00:56:07.123 --> 00:56:09.229
- Right. Ji Yung must be hungry.
- He's an athlete, after all.

00:56:09.253 --> 00:56:10.269
I'm okay.

00:56:10.293 --> 00:56:12.093
- You're not hungry?
- I'm okay.

00:56:14.693 --> 00:56:16.193
Let's go watch the dinner show.

00:56:16.233 --> 00:56:17.933
- Why?
- He's really cool.

00:56:18.733 --> 00:56:19.733
(Peeking)

00:56:20.203 --> 00:56:21.309
Hello.

00:56:21.333 --> 00:56:22.649
- You must be hungry.
- I will cook for you.

00:56:22.673 --> 00:56:23.673
Really?

00:56:23.803 --> 00:56:24.979
- Then...
- Sounds great.

00:56:25.003 --> 00:56:26.849
Should we buy some coffee?

00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:28.889
- Here?
- Come on.

00:56:28.913 --> 00:56:30.813
(Staring)

00:56:32.343 --> 00:56:37.713
(Mu Jin watches Ji Yung and Bon Hee.)

00:56:38.423 --> 00:56:39.899
- It's been a while since...
- Wouldn't they have it?

00:56:39.923 --> 00:56:42.023
- Like this.
- Right, like that?

00:56:43.993 --> 00:56:46.193
- Where is he going?
- I am going to the bathroom.

00:56:46.723 --> 00:56:47.893
I'm sorry.

00:56:50.263 --> 00:56:53.379
(After seeing the two, Mu Jin leaves.)

00:56:53.403 --> 00:56:54.873
Oh, dear.

00:56:55.773 --> 00:56:57.813
He's not going to the
bathroom. He's avoiding them.

00:57:00.243 --> 00:57:01.819
Oh, no. He's sighing.

00:57:01.843 --> 00:57:03.283
(Mu Jin tries to calm his emotions.)

00:57:05.183 --> 00:57:07.659
It's only been two days, but
we got really close, didn't we?

00:57:07.683 --> 00:57:09.183
Totally. We did.

00:57:09.653 --> 00:57:10.889
It might be good that you came today.

00:57:10.913 --> 00:57:12.359
- Right.
- Is it better?

00:57:12.383 --> 00:57:13.799
It would've been bad if you came tomorrow.

00:57:13.823 --> 00:57:16.599
If you came tomorrow, we
would've been much closer.

00:57:16.623 --> 00:57:18.399
- We are...
- Are you okay?

00:57:18.423 --> 00:57:19.663
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

00:57:19.823 --> 00:57:20.800
- This...
- Did I do it?

00:57:20.824 --> 00:57:22.139
- Be careful.
- Did I do it?

00:57:22.163 --> 00:57:23.239
- It turns really easily.
- Yes.

00:57:23.263 --> 00:57:24.779
- Sang Won.
- Did I do it? Really?

00:57:24.803 --> 00:57:25.803
- No.
- Really?

00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:27.503
Do you want this?

00:57:28.303 --> 00:57:30.003
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:57:30.433 --> 00:57:31.943
- You...
- Come on up.

00:57:33.003 --> 00:57:34.379
- There you go.
- Sang Won.

00:57:34.403 --> 00:57:35.473
I'm sorry.

00:57:36.073 --> 00:57:38.083
Let's push it back.

00:57:38.813 --> 00:57:40.643
Mu Jin is back.

00:57:41.183 --> 00:57:43.329
- I will sit here.
- He's sitting next to her.

00:57:43.353 --> 00:57:44.983
(He sits on the sofa next to Bon Hee.)

00:57:45.123 --> 00:57:46.283
(Peeking)

00:57:48.923 --> 00:57:51.563
(He stares at the phone for no reason.)

00:57:53.923 --> 00:57:54.909
(Peeking)

00:57:54.933 --> 00:57:56.593
- Are you taking a selfie?
- No.

00:57:58.333 --> 00:57:59.979
- Why are you sitting there?
- What?

00:58:00.003 --> 00:58:01.263
Why are you sitting there?

00:58:01.473 --> 00:58:03.473
- Should I come down?
- Yes.

00:58:05.603 --> 00:58:07.149
(Mu Jin listens to Bon
Hee and sits next to her.)

00:58:07.173 --> 00:58:09.213
He's hilarious.

00:58:10.273 --> 00:58:11.583
Goodness.

00:58:12.543 --> 00:58:15.229
I think Mu Jin is trying to show her

00:58:15.253 --> 00:58:18.129
that he's gone sulky.

00:58:18.153 --> 00:58:20.129
When he just sits
down, - He's gone sulky.

00:58:20.153 --> 00:58:21.799
- She wouldn't notice it.
- So he kept doing this.

00:58:21.823 --> 00:58:23.929
- That's why he made it noticeable.
- "I've gone sulky."

00:58:23.953 --> 00:58:25.363
I think Mu Jin

00:58:26.193 --> 00:58:27.693
is very quick-witted.

00:58:27.893 --> 00:58:28.933
What makes you say that?

00:58:29.233 --> 00:58:32.703
He decided to leave the place quickly.

00:58:33.003 --> 00:58:34.479
- That he got up?
- It means

00:58:34.503 --> 00:58:37.379
he is wise enough to control

00:58:37.403 --> 00:58:39.303
his emotions.

00:58:39.903 --> 00:58:42.713
He had to leave to change the air.

00:58:43.143 --> 00:58:44.989
So he left the place,

00:58:45.013 --> 00:58:47.843
calmed his emotions, and returned.

00:58:48.013 --> 00:58:50.083
If I were him, I would sit there...

00:58:50.753 --> 00:58:53.753
- "What do I do?"
- and just watch everything.

00:58:55.223 --> 00:58:56.669
"Let's see how this unfolds."

00:58:56.693 --> 00:58:58.439
(Anxious, nervous)

00:58:58.463 --> 00:58:59.823
I will just keep drinking.

00:59:00.663 --> 00:59:02.863
- And end up drunk.
- I hate that.

00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:05.509
If he's someone I'm into, - I know.

00:59:05.533 --> 00:59:06.939
I would hate it.

00:59:06.963 --> 00:59:10.003
"From what I've observed..."

00:59:10.133 --> 00:59:12.519
After hearing what you said...

00:59:12.543 --> 00:59:14.303
- Is he amazing?
- Yes. Mu Jin handled it

00:59:15.813 --> 00:59:17.919
very professionally.

00:59:17.943 --> 00:59:19.259
- Right.
- Is he a professional now?

00:59:19.283 --> 00:59:21.713
- He's a professional.
- He's skilful.

00:59:21.983 --> 00:59:23.313
The way he handled it.

00:59:23.683 --> 00:59:24.753
It was so good.

00:59:27.783 --> 00:59:29.823
It was really impressive
when I had the first bite.

00:59:30.093 --> 00:59:31.099
It was so good.

00:59:31.123 --> 00:59:32.769
(Love QR messages are sent.
(Check the younger men's hearts.)

00:59:32.793 --> 00:59:34.199
It's the men's choice now, isn't it?

00:59:34.223 --> 00:59:35.909
Today, - It's the men this time.

00:59:35.933 --> 00:59:37.893
- They get to find out.
- It will be so much fun.

00:59:39.633 --> 00:59:41.979
(Today, the ladies get to check...)

00:59:42.003 --> 00:59:47.173
(how the younger men feel about them.)

00:59:47.273 --> 00:59:51.173
(Who captured the hearts
of the younger men?)

00:59:56.983 --> 01:00:00.653
(Ye Eun came first to check
the Love QR message.)

01:00:01.623 --> 01:00:04.823
(Did Ye Eun receive any Love QR message?)

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.663
After going on a date with Sang Won,

01:00:10.793 --> 01:00:14.533
I felt like getting to know him more.

01:00:16.473 --> 01:00:18.773
(How many people do you
want to get to know more?)

01:00:21.643 --> 01:00:24.819
(Sang Won wanted to get
to know one more woman.)

01:00:24.843 --> 01:00:25.943
(And that made Ye Eun sad.)

01:00:26.213 --> 01:00:28.813
- That made the mood turn bad.
- Yes, she had a bitter smile.

01:00:29.313 --> 01:00:32.983
(But Sang Won approached her again.)

01:00:34.523 --> 01:00:38.493
(And their relationship improved.)

01:00:39.263 --> 01:00:42.493
(Did Sang Won send Ye
Eun a Love QR message?)

01:00:42.933 --> 01:00:44.063
Did he?

01:00:45.663 --> 01:00:48.933
(You have received no Love QR message.)

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.803
What?

01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:52.579
Sang Won!

01:00:52.603 --> 01:00:53.679
(Don't do this!)

01:00:53.703 --> 01:00:55.343
But why?

01:00:55.873 --> 01:00:56.989
What is this?

01:00:57.013 --> 01:00:58.113
(But why?)

01:01:05.883 --> 01:01:08.793
After checking the Love QR Code,

01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:12.539
it got me thinking a lot.

01:01:12.563 --> 01:01:15.993
(It got me thinking a lot.)

01:01:17.963 --> 01:01:19.303
There's that too.

01:01:19.863 --> 01:01:21.463
But everyone is super nice.

01:01:21.903 --> 01:01:23.273
I don't feel so good.

01:01:23.673 --> 01:01:25.473
I'm sure.

01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:27.979
Her first date, Sang Hyeon is gone,

01:01:28.003 --> 01:01:29.919
- Right.
- And Sang Won, her second date,

01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:31.449
is also gone.

01:01:31.473 --> 01:01:32.843
(Throwing)

01:01:39.623 --> 01:01:41.259
(On the second day,
Ye Eun didn't receive...)

01:01:41.283 --> 01:01:45.723
(any Love QR message.)

01:01:46.993 --> 01:01:48.963
I'm hurt.

01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:50.993
Did we expect too much from Sang Won?

01:01:51.363 --> 01:01:52.979
Looking back, Sang Won

01:01:53.003 --> 01:01:56.273
never approached Ye Eun

01:01:56.473 --> 01:01:58.373
that aggressively.

01:01:58.543 --> 01:02:00.379
- He asked her out on a date.
- He asked her out on a date.

01:02:00.403 --> 01:02:01.619
Isn't that being aggressive?

01:02:01.643 --> 01:02:03.073
- Asking her out on a date?
- Yes.

01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:05.689
- You wouldn't just date anyone.
- Five-Minute Time Attack Date.

01:02:05.713 --> 01:02:07.489
- Right.
- Okay.

01:02:07.513 --> 01:02:08.959
He was all touchy too.

01:02:08.983 --> 01:02:10.089
- Okay?
- Okay?

01:02:10.113 --> 01:02:11.599
(Okay! Let's say he
appraoched her aggressively.)

01:02:11.623 --> 01:02:14.029
- I'm sad. They went on a date too.
- I think this is the reason

01:02:14.053 --> 01:02:15.329
why you feel offended by Sang Won.

01:02:15.353 --> 01:02:18.293
Sang Won tried hard from time to time

01:02:18.763 --> 01:02:20.523
to make Ye Eun feel better.

01:02:20.923 --> 01:02:22.639
- Right.
- But that was

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:24.639
just Sang Won being considerate,

01:02:24.663 --> 01:02:28.549
being a nice person he is.

01:02:28.573 --> 01:02:31.179
Shouldn't he have sent the
message if he was considerate?

01:02:31.203 --> 01:02:32.519
- No, he shouldn't.
- He shouldn't.

01:02:32.543 --> 01:02:35.049
Being considerate of her
doesn't mean he loves her.

01:02:35.073 --> 01:02:36.489
If he's considerate, he
shouldn't send her a message.

01:02:36.513 --> 01:02:37.773
Why did he not send it?

01:02:40.643 --> 01:02:42.989
(Ji Won is the second visitor.)

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:44.013
Goodness.

01:02:48.183 --> 01:02:54.093
(She nervously checks Love
QR Code for the first time.)

01:02:56.963 --> 01:02:58.063
What is it?

01:03:03.803 --> 01:03:07.703
(You have received no Love QR message.)

01:03:09.073 --> 01:03:13.283
(She scans the Love QR
Code once again to make sure.)

01:03:16.953 --> 01:03:18.629
(But the result doesn't change.)

01:03:18.653 --> 01:03:21.253
Oh, dear. That's sad.

01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:25.339
It made me wonder if I
was not appealing to them

01:03:25.363 --> 01:03:26.663
as a woman.

01:03:27.093 --> 01:03:30.193
I think they just see me as someone fun.

01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.079
Since I'm already here,

01:03:32.103 --> 01:03:35.409
I should change. That's what I thought.

01:03:35.433 --> 01:03:37.449
- No.
- She can think that.

01:03:37.473 --> 01:03:38.903
That's understandable.

01:03:39.343 --> 01:03:41.549
(On the second day, )

01:03:41.573 --> 01:03:44.713
(Ji Won and Ye Eun didn't
receive a Love QR message.)

01:03:48.713 --> 01:03:50.113
(Surprised)

01:03:52.553 --> 01:03:55.423
(Bon Hee heads to her Love QR Code.)

01:03:56.823 --> 01:03:58.423
(Taking breath)

01:04:00.063 --> 01:04:04.793
(Is there any Love QR message for Bon Hee?)

01:04:07.933 --> 01:04:09.303
(Surprised)

01:04:09.733 --> 01:04:10.590
(Did Bon Hee receive a Love QR message?)

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:15.448
(Is there any Love QR message for Bon Hee?)

01:04:18.548 --> 01:04:19.918
(Surprised)

01:04:20.348 --> 01:04:23.848
(Did Bon Hee receive a Love QR message?)

01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:27.288
(You have received four Love QR message.)

01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:28.834
- No way.
- Four people?

01:04:28.858 --> 01:04:30.064
(4 people sent Bon Hee a Love QR message?)

01:04:30.088 --> 01:04:31.088
(What is happening?)

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:32.598
That's terrible.

01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:34.204
(Four younger men have chosen Bon Hee.)

01:04:34.228 --> 01:04:35.628
She must feel flustered.

01:04:37.698 --> 01:04:40.038
I felt happy,

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.918
and at the same time, I felt confused.

01:04:44.578 --> 01:04:48.348
(Who are the 4 younger men
that sent her the messages?)

01:04:49.808 --> 01:04:53.118
(What about the last one,
Yeong Gyeong's Love QR Code?)

01:04:54.618 --> 01:04:57.194
(You have received one Love QR message.)

01:04:57.218 --> 01:05:00.288
We think it must be from Hyeon Jun.

01:05:00.658 --> 01:05:02.434
That's our guess.

01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:03.834
- It might be someone else.
- Yes.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.504
(I want to listen to good music with you.)

01:05:05.528 --> 01:05:06.658
Music?

01:05:07.428 --> 01:05:12.338
(On their way to the date,
they talked about music.)

01:05:13.198 --> 01:05:16.138
(I listen to music a lot at home too.)

01:05:17.508 --> 01:05:19.654
She seemed to like listening to music.

01:05:19.678 --> 01:05:21.778
So I said I wanted to listen
to good music with her.

01:05:21.878 --> 01:05:24.054
It was Hyeon Jun after all.

01:05:24.078 --> 01:05:25.318
(Hyeon Jun chose Yeong Gyeong.)

01:05:27.448 --> 01:05:29.948
(Love QR Zone on the second day is closed.)

01:05:30.948 --> 01:05:34.788
(After the Love QR event,
they gathered again.)

01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:38.934
(Bon Hee, who received
4 messages, returns.)

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:41.404
Oh, dear. Now, all the younger men

01:05:41.428 --> 01:05:42.798
will seem different to her.

01:05:43.298 --> 01:05:44.275
I'm sure.

01:05:44.299 --> 01:05:45.468
(Peeking)

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:53.478
(She received messages from Mu Jin,
Ji Yung, Sang Won, and Sang Hyeon.)

01:05:54.808 --> 01:05:56.954
I expected two people.

01:05:56.978 --> 01:05:58.878
Ji Yung and

01:05:59.248 --> 01:06:02.088
I thought Mu Jin would've chosen me too.

01:06:02.688 --> 01:06:06.164
(Let's go eat pizza next time!)

01:06:06.188 --> 01:06:07.758
I want to eat pizza too.

01:06:08.288 --> 01:06:09.988
What if you eat pizza with someone else?

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:11.634
(Gosh.)

01:06:11.658 --> 01:06:13.058
It wouldn't taste so good.

01:06:13.758 --> 01:06:14.928
I mean it.

01:06:15.368 --> 01:06:16.644
He's so cute.

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.314
He expresses his
affection without hesitation.

01:06:18.338 --> 01:06:20.974
(Take a photo for me next time!)

01:06:20.998 --> 01:06:24.038
(Ji Yung is the second
person who sent the message.)

01:06:24.508 --> 01:06:26.138
(I like a man who likes linen.)

01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:28.378
(When I choose what to wear, )

01:06:28.448 --> 01:06:30.624
(I choose linen clothes very often.)

01:06:30.648 --> 01:06:32.078
- So cute.
- Oh, really?

01:06:32.918 --> 01:06:36.364
When we talked, I realized
that she is a great person.

01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:37.918
I had a lot of fun today.

01:06:38.488 --> 01:06:39.688
That's why I chose her.

01:06:41.858 --> 01:06:43.434
The other two have never

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.258
given me any signs.

01:06:46.098 --> 01:06:52.138
(For the first time, she
realized how the two feel.)

01:06:53.068 --> 01:06:59.014
(The one who sent the third message)

01:06:59.038 --> 01:07:01.554
(Sang Hyeon)

01:07:01.578 --> 01:07:03.948
I think I like Bon Hee.

01:07:04.348 --> 01:07:05.454
I liked her first impression.

01:07:05.478 --> 01:07:06.678
He thinks he likes Bon Hee.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:11.588
(Since the first time they
met, Sang Hyeon's heart grew.)

01:07:11.758 --> 01:07:13.418
(Bong Hee?)

01:07:13.618 --> 01:07:16.428
- Bon Hee.
- Bon Hee.

01:07:17.228 --> 01:07:21.328
(The first time they met, he felt nervous.)

01:07:22.068 --> 01:07:24.244
(And naturally, )

01:07:24.268 --> 01:07:27.338
(his eyes followed Bon Hee.)

01:07:28.238 --> 01:07:30.238
You have something in
your hair. Can I get it off?

01:07:30.768 --> 01:07:31.838
What is it?

01:07:34.308 --> 01:07:36.178
Who did you choose?

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:37.778
Bon Hee.

01:07:38.718 --> 01:07:43.348
(Because of a moment's hesitation,
he missed the chance to date her.)

01:07:44.048 --> 01:07:47.658
Who else do you want to talk to?

01:07:51.128 --> 01:07:52.134
Bon Hee.

01:07:52.158 --> 01:07:55.568
(In front of another person,
he revealed his true feelings.)

01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:59.668
Mu Jin is the only one I
showed my feelings to.

01:07:59.738 --> 01:08:01.268
When we were alone,

01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:03.308
I asked him how Bon Hee was.

01:08:03.608 --> 01:08:05.578
I wanted to find out any
information about her.

01:08:08.608 --> 01:08:10.578
(How was it with Bon Hee?)

01:08:11.418 --> 01:08:14.888
(He couldn't stop being curious
about the date with Bon Hee.)

01:08:16.248 --> 01:08:18.458
I will do it at my pace.

01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:20.235
Goodness.

01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:22.899
(Sang Hyeon expressed his
feelings to Bon Hee for the first time.)

01:08:22.928 --> 01:08:23.905
(The person who sent the fourth message...)

01:08:23.929 --> 01:08:25.298
"Let's take a photo together."

01:08:27.558 --> 01:08:31.398
(is Sang Won.)

01:08:31.968 --> 01:08:34.298
I never had a chance to talk to Bon Hee.

01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:37.938
I am curious to learn about who Bon Hee is.

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:43.384
That's why I sent the
message to Bon Hee today.

01:08:43.408 --> 01:08:45.454
(The other person Sang Won
wanted to get to know was Bon Hee.)

01:08:45.478 --> 01:08:46.694
What will they do?

01:08:46.718 --> 01:08:49.688
(Sang Won's Love QR message
was for Bon Hee, not Ye Eun.)

01:08:50.418 --> 01:08:51.664
(The second night deepens, )

01:08:51.688 --> 01:08:53.334
The emotions are running wild.

01:08:53.358 --> 01:08:55.028
(with emotions running wild.)

01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:57.104
Beer. Do you have beer?

01:08:57.128 --> 01:08:58.798
- We have beer.
- We have beer.

01:08:58.898 --> 01:09:00.504
- Because you mentioned it...
- Yes.

01:09:00.528 --> 01:09:03.928
Because I don't drink, I
don't know when to pour.

01:09:04.528 --> 01:09:06.144
You shouldn't mind it.

01:09:06.168 --> 01:09:07.474
(Handing it to her)

01:09:07.498 --> 01:09:08.514
You want me to pour it?

01:09:08.538 --> 01:09:09.768
(Nodding)

01:09:10.368 --> 01:09:12.284
What's the ratio? What are you drinking?

01:09:12.308 --> 01:09:14.484
(Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon
express their feelings differently.)

01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:15.808
I don't really know.

01:09:17.578 --> 01:09:19.378
- Things change so quickly.
- Are you hungry?

01:09:20.218 --> 01:09:22.178
I'm constantly eating,
but I'm constantly hungry.

01:09:22.888 --> 01:09:24.088
You will regret it tomorrow.

01:09:24.718 --> 01:09:26.394
- Why?
- You will regret it in the morning.

01:09:26.418 --> 01:09:27.734
- Because my face will swell?
- Yes.

01:09:27.758 --> 01:09:29.158
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.358
It's okay.

01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:32.258
It bothers me so much.

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:36.644
Your face isn't swollen at all.

01:09:36.668 --> 01:09:37.704
It's okay now, - In the morning?

01:09:37.728 --> 01:09:38.814
But tomorrow...

01:09:38.838 --> 01:09:42.208
If you need, I will apply
shading on your face.

01:09:43.168 --> 01:09:45.278
- You will do it for me?
- I will do it for you.

01:09:45.508 --> 01:09:46.684
- You will?
- The makeup.

01:09:46.708 --> 01:09:47.984
- Then your face will look...
- Really?

01:09:48.008 --> 01:09:49.284
Sharper on screen.

01:09:49.308 --> 01:09:51.448
Right. It makes a huge difference.

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:54.754
Can you do that for me?

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:56.324
If you come at the end
and ask to contour your face,

01:09:56.348 --> 01:09:57.548
I'll do it for you.

01:09:58.258 --> 01:10:00.258
"Please apply shading on my face."

01:10:00.288 --> 01:10:01.464
I will do it here in the living room.

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:02.968
(Even a little joke makes him smile.)

01:10:03.428 --> 01:10:06.534
(The other 3 younger
men are after Bon Hee too.)

01:10:06.558 --> 01:10:08.404
- Oh, dear.
- There's tension.

01:10:08.428 --> 01:10:10.498
Four men are going after one woman.

01:10:11.998 --> 01:10:15.084
- Oh, dear.
- What's going to happen?

01:10:15.108 --> 01:10:16.908
(How will today's Love
QR Code stir them up?)

01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:22.978
(Sang Hyeon returns to his
room after the drinking is over.)

01:10:23.908 --> 01:10:25.094
(He's lost in thought.)

01:10:25.118 --> 01:10:26.798
- What did he think about?
- I wonder too.

01:10:27.218 --> 01:10:28.388
What is it?

01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:32.518
(Sighing)

01:10:38.558 --> 01:10:41.428
(He checks his face all of a sudden.)

01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:48.668
(Sang Hyeon heads somewhere.)

01:10:50.008 --> 01:10:53.338
(Did he go to the women's floor?)

01:10:53.608 --> 01:10:55.848
(She finds Sang Hyeon.)

01:10:55.908 --> 01:10:57.654
- It's over, though.
- Sorry?

01:10:57.678 --> 01:10:59.548
- It's over.
- What is?

01:10:59.978 --> 01:11:01.524
We cleaned up.

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:03.918
No, I just want to talk to Bon Hee.

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:06.834
- Do you want me to get her?
- Yes, please.

01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:08.904
Can you wait a little?

01:11:08.928 --> 01:11:10.264
Can you tell her that I
will be on the first floor?

01:11:10.288 --> 01:11:11.628
The first floor? Okay.

01:11:13.528 --> 01:11:16.844
He wants to spend time with her

01:11:16.868 --> 01:11:18.974
when nobody else is around,
so he mustered up his courage.

01:11:18.998 --> 01:11:21.968
I think he's amazing.

01:11:22.338 --> 01:11:25.508
I hope Sang Hyeon
would express his feelings.

01:11:25.608 --> 01:11:26.814
I hope so too.

01:11:26.838 --> 01:11:29.454
I think he's going to be
quite aggressive this time.

01:11:29.478 --> 01:11:30.884
Will he tell her that
he has feelings for her?

01:11:30.908 --> 01:11:33.224
"Can you go on a date with me tomorrow?"

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:34.294
- Right.
- Yes.

01:11:34.318 --> 01:11:37.194
I think he will get a chance
only if he's aggressive.

01:11:37.218 --> 01:11:38.658
I think he has to go the extra mile.

01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:40.864
Can you tell her that I
will be on the first floor?

01:11:40.888 --> 01:11:42.258
The first floor? Okay.

01:11:44.588 --> 01:11:50.128
(For the first time, Sang
Hyeon asked Bon Hee to talk.)

01:11:50.998 --> 01:11:53.038
I should express my
feelings even if it's subtle.

01:11:53.438 --> 01:11:55.138
Whatever happens,

01:11:57.408 --> 01:12:00.208
I thought I should talk
to her. So I went to her,

01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:02.054
and talked to her.

01:12:02.078 --> 01:12:04.448
(Finally, Sang Hyeon starts to move.)

01:12:04.678 --> 01:12:07.754
Sang Hyeon is waiting
for you on the first floor.

01:12:07.778 --> 01:12:09.818
- Sang Hyeon?
- He's waiting.

01:12:09.988 --> 01:12:11.324
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

01:12:11.348 --> 01:12:12.418
Okay.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:17.328
Sang Hyeon?

01:12:35.478 --> 01:12:36.548
(Surprised)

01:12:38.048 --> 01:12:40.148
- Where do you want to go?
- I...

01:12:40.918 --> 01:12:42.648
- Outside?
- Outside?

01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:44.648
- I don't think it's too hot.
- Right.

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:49.528
(Sang Hyeon and Bon
Hee sit on the terrace.)

01:12:50.858 --> 01:12:53.258
(Thinking)

01:12:53.798 --> 01:12:55.428
(Laughing)

01:12:55.528 --> 01:12:56.928
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:12:59.338 --> 01:13:01.398
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Right.

01:13:01.468 --> 01:13:02.608
I am

01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:06.478
not the type to talk in front of everyone.

01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:09.608
I felt sorry about it, so I
asked you to talk in private.

01:13:10.848 --> 01:13:13.124
(Do you know how INFPs flirt?)

01:13:13.148 --> 01:13:14.148
How?

01:13:14.678 --> 01:13:16.264
(Dressing up nicely and
lingering around that person)

01:13:16.288 --> 01:13:17.864
I'm sure he thought he
couldn't do this anymore.

01:13:17.888 --> 01:13:20.858
(Sang Hyeon confessed his hidden feelings.)

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:25.658
(I was really grateful that he
worked up his courage like that.)

01:13:27.828 --> 01:13:30.548
(Will Sang Hyeon's sincerity be
enough to shake up Bon Hee's heart?)

01:13:30.898 --> 01:13:32.798
(Do we each choose a bag?)

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:37.308
(They must choose a date partner
based on the items in the bags.)

01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:43.308
(A subtle battle of wits for the
women to find their desired dates)

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:46.618
(Today's fate was decided
simply based on a bag.)

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:49.248
(The older women wait
for the owner of the bag.)

01:13:49.418 --> 01:13:50.688
(Did you know it was me?)

01:13:51.118 --> 01:13:53.458
(I've been wanting to talk to you too.)

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:57.088
(Who will be the older
women's date partners?)

01:13:58.428 --> 01:14:00.234
