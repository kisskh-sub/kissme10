19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
You're gonna be okay.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.041
I promise.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.916
[Bowdrie] Hey.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.541
You did good today.
You were strong.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.166
You too.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.250
I gotta go into town
again tomorrow.

19:38.416 --> 19:39.791
Get more medicine
and whatnot.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.166
It'd be a good idea
if you didn't go
fishing for a while.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.458
You get me?

19:43.875 --> 19:45.541
Stick around the house.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.083
-Yes, sir.
-Got to leave early.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.375
So, just keep her in bed.

19:49.541 --> 19:51.166
Give her a bunch of liquids.

19:53.291 --> 19:57.416
Hey, we don't know her,
so we don't trust her.

19:57.583 --> 19:58.833
Okay?

20:00.791 --> 20:01.875
Night, Bo.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.333
Night.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.083
[♪♪♪]

20:12.250 --> 20:13.916
[firewood crackling]

20:31.791 --> 20:33.166
[grunts softly]

20:36.041 --> 20:37.208
[groans]

20:40.458 --> 20:41.583
Huh?

20:48.583 --> 20:49.875
Good morning.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.000
Did you handcuff me?

20:58.041 --> 20:59.708
What did you do that for?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.125
We don't know you.

21:02.791 --> 21:03.958
[sighs]

21:08.291 --> 21:09.708
[grunting]

21:13.375 --> 21:14.625
[coughing]

21:14.791 --> 21:17.458
Bo told me
that if you tried to move,

21:17.625 --> 21:18.750
I'd have to shoot you.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.333
I'm just kidding.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.666
[chuckles nervously]

21:39.375 --> 21:40.666
[exhales heavily]

21:41.833 --> 21:42.958
I'm Tag.

21:45.750 --> 21:46.875
Hi.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.833
I'm January.

21:53.791 --> 21:56.291
[indistinct conversations]

22:02.916 --> 22:04.250
-[sighs]
-Hey, there.

22:04.416 --> 22:05.583
There you go.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.375
[scanner beeping]

22:14.125 --> 22:17.250
Well, would you look at that?
That brings back old memories.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.750
Good choice.
That'll be 38.99.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.291
[siren blaring]

22:28.208 --> 22:30.875
[Brake]
Put the condoms down.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.250
Now, why'd I do that?

22:32.416 --> 22:33.791
Keeps your wife's
lipstick off of me.

22:33.958 --> 22:36.500
[chuckles]
Well, how you doing, ugly?

22:36.666 --> 22:37.916
What, you really wanna know
or are you shitting me?

22:38.083 --> 22:39.500
I'm just shittin'.

22:39.833 --> 22:40.958
Hey, you got time for a bite?
We're going to Lucille's.

22:41.125 --> 22:42.458
No, I got some
errands to run.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.750
All right. Well, hey,
this is Davenport,

22:44.916 --> 22:45.833
fresh from Tulsa.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.125
-Hey.
-This is Bowdrie.

22:47.291 --> 22:48.875
He's trouble.
River folk.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.333
Yeah. Don't take
the wrong turn.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.833
[Brake] We go way back.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.958
Hey, uh-- Hey,
you bag anything worth
bragging about yet?

22:55.125 --> 22:57.000
Oh, Tag got one
a couple of days back.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.208
-Big?
-Big enough to eat.

23:00.791 --> 23:02.333
I went out the other morning.
I didn't see nothing.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.000
That's 'cause they
saw you first.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.375
Gotta sneak up on em.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.708
[Brake] How's the kiddo?

23:07.500 --> 23:08.791
I think she'll outlive me.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.833
All right, well,
you keep on keeping on,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.541
and, I'll probably come
see you sometime.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.083
-I get bored enough.
-You bet.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.291
-All right, well,
see you, big man.
-See you.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.000
Keep your nose clean.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.000
[door creaks]

23:34.458 --> 23:35.541
[sighs]

23:49.250 --> 23:50.625
[knocking]

23:50.791 --> 23:52.416
[Tag] Did you see that
January has tattoos?

23:52.583 --> 23:54.541
Let me get me that
5/16th over there.

23:55.375 --> 23:56.458
Thanks.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.750
Did my mom have tattoos?

24:01.916 --> 24:03.250
She had a few.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.375
They were all kind
of run together.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.541
She had a lot, actually.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.041
I used to think that
they looked kind of weird,

24:14.791 --> 24:17.000
but I think
January's look cool.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.208
Did you see it?

24:18.375 --> 24:19.541
Yeah.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.916
Don't you go
getting any ideas.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.625
Oh, that's not gonna work.
No.

24:33.958 --> 24:36.666
[faucet running]

25:00.916 --> 25:02.083
[switch flicks]

25:08.000 --> 25:09.375
[Bowdrie sighs]

25:14.458 --> 25:15.625
You're gonna live.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.958
[January sighs]

25:28.333 --> 25:29.958
How long have I been here?

25:31.166 --> 25:32.666
A couple of days now.

25:35.583 --> 25:36.875
[grunts]

25:42.041 --> 25:43.500
Who are you?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.500
My name is January Evers.

25:51.666 --> 25:53.625
You think you can tell me
what happened?

25:53.791 --> 25:55.041
[sighs]

25:58.125 --> 25:59.500
They took me.

26:02.083 --> 26:03.875
I was just coming
home from the gym.

26:04.041 --> 26:07.041
I just walked into
my apartment,

26:07.208 --> 26:09.083
and they were there.

26:09.791 --> 26:10.958
[January]
Lizzie.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.208
Liz was hurt.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.041
[high-pitched scream]

26:15.208 --> 26:16.416
They beat the shit
out of me.

26:16.583 --> 26:17.833
-[thug grunts]
-[thud]

26:20.708 --> 26:25.291
Just heard 'em screaming about
some guy who was his friend.

26:27.916 --> 26:30.250
And that they had stolen
something from them.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.333
He took us,
put us in a car,

26:35.500 --> 26:37.625
drove us,
I don't know how long.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.208
Car stops.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.166
[sobbing]

26:45.166 --> 26:46.583
They pulled us out.

26:48.583 --> 26:50.083
[January shudders]

26:50.250 --> 26:52.291
She told them she
didn't know anything.

26:52.458 --> 26:53.958
[stream gushing]

26:58.916 --> 27:00.166
-They shot her.
-[Lizzie] No, no, no, no.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.666
-[January] Lizzie!
-[gunshot]

27:01.833 --> 27:02.916
No!

27:05.125 --> 27:06.583
[sighs]

27:06.750 --> 27:09.458
And I left her there,
I just started running.

27:14.541 --> 27:18.250
I broke free,
and I just, uh, I...

27:22.333 --> 27:23.500
I heard the shot.

27:24.208 --> 27:27.125
I felt it, I fell over

27:27.291 --> 27:31.166
this bridge
by the water, and...

27:31.333 --> 27:32.333
[January sighs]

27:33.583 --> 27:35.083
I heard them
looking for me.

27:37.208 --> 27:41.583
So I crawled
into the water

27:41.750 --> 27:45.166
and just held my breath
for as long as I could.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.416
The last thing
that I remember

27:48.583 --> 27:50.375
is them saying
that I must be dead,

27:50.750 --> 27:51.791
and they left.

27:52.416 --> 27:53.916
[sniffles]

27:56.000 --> 27:57.291
Tell me about the other girl.

28:00.541 --> 28:01.958
[sniffles]

28:02.916 --> 28:05.791
Liz. Uh... Elizabeth.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.708
She was my best friend.

28:17.416 --> 28:18.625
[exhales]

28:22.375 --> 28:23.875
She was my only friend.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.625
[grunts softly]

28:48.958 --> 28:50.166
[grunts softly]

28:58.708 --> 29:00.416
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

29:00.583 --> 29:01.958
-Where the hell
have you been?
-Oh, I took a walk.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.791
Figured I'd give
the season a final look.

29:04.541 --> 29:05.916
Why didn't you tell me?

29:06.083 --> 29:09.333
Well, you talk too much.
I needed some quiet.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.291
-Where did you go?
-Nowhere.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.500
You know,
around the woods.
What the hell?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.500
Where were you?

29:17.958 --> 29:20.208
I'm gonna need
to run back into town again.

29:20.791 --> 29:23.666
-You just went.
-Yeah, well,
I need to go again.

29:23.833 --> 29:26.166
I need to pick up some
spark plugs for that mower.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.166
And why don't you get
to your schoolwork?

29:28.333 --> 29:30.958
-I was about to go
looking for you.
-Tag.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.791
Stay near the house.
All right?

29:34.291 --> 29:35.666
-Yes, sir.
-How's she doing?

29:36.333 --> 29:37.333
She's sleeping.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.875
Good. I won't be long.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.291
[gun clicks]

29:49.875 --> 29:51.333
What is-- What is it?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.250
[sighs]
What's what, kid?

29:54.583 --> 29:56.833
You don't go to town
this much,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.375
and we're not gonna
use that lawnmower
for another four months.

29:59.541 --> 30:02.416
I mean, you say yourself that
people live season to season.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.250
This ain't like you.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.333
Eventually we're going to have
to take her back into town.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.125
-To the hospital.
-Why?

30:15.291 --> 30:17.083
Because there's nothing
more we can do for her.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.250
You said that she
was healing up and she
didn't want to go.

30:20.416 --> 30:22.291
-And then you agreed--
-Yeah, I know what I said.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.708
Well, that's bullshit.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.958
Yeah, it is. Come here.

30:31.708 --> 30:33.583
[sighs]
But it's necessary bullshit.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.500
Right now you're gonna
keep tugging on the sweater.

30:35.666 --> 30:37.000
I'm gonna drag
you right into it.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.875
There's a dead woman
in the river down there.

30:39.041 --> 30:42.583
I just saw her, all tangled up
in the branches and left to rot.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.083
Somebody shot her
right in the face,

30:44.250 --> 30:46.291
blew her brains out,
dumped her in the water.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.250
Now, do you think our
newfound friend in here,

30:50.416 --> 30:51.916
in our home, might
have been shot by
the same fellas,

30:52.083 --> 30:53.833
left her for dead?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.250
What do you figure they'll do
if they find out she's alive?

30:57.125 --> 30:58.708
Come back here
and get her is what.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.041
The world is full of ugly
people doing ugly things.

31:03.583 --> 31:05.583
Some horrible shit you can't
even wrap your head around.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.750
It's just the nature
of the beast.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.125
Get back in the house, tool up,
and lock all the doors.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.250
-Okay, baby?
-Yes, sir.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.541
-Okay.
-[door creaks]

31:42.791 --> 31:44.583
-[sighs]
-[line ringing]

31:46.208 --> 31:48.250
[dispatch]
Antler Sheriff Station,
may I help you?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.375
Hello?

31:59.625 --> 32:02.166
Could you do something
for me?

32:04.416 --> 32:06.041
I gotta go to the bathroom.

32:09.583 --> 32:12.166
[♪♪♪]

32:32.458 --> 32:33.583
[grunts softly]

32:43.958 --> 32:46.000
[Tag] Are you okay in there?

32:46.166 --> 32:47.500
Just need a sec.

33:19.541 --> 33:21.166
-Oh.
-I think I need to sit down.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.458
[January groans]

33:26.916 --> 33:30.125
[breathing heavily]

33:38.000 --> 33:39.375
You're pretty.

33:41.666 --> 33:44.375
-I don't feel too pretty.
-You are.

33:45.083 --> 33:48.250
Just going through
a hard time right now.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.125
My mom was pretty.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.250
Where is your mom?

33:57.416 --> 33:59.041
She died when I was little.

34:00.083 --> 34:03.041
But he says
she didn't hurt, so...

34:04.416 --> 34:05.791
That's the way it goes.

34:05.958 --> 34:07.291
Life's hard.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.458
I'm sorry.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.375
I'm sorry about your friend.

34:16.375 --> 34:17.750
Bo told me.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.333
Me too.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.583
Do you want your tea?

34:25.083 --> 34:26.291
Sure.

34:34.833 --> 34:36.041
Where is your dad?

34:36.583 --> 34:38.416
Bo? He, uh...

34:38.583 --> 34:39.875
He went to town.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.416
Bo?

34:43.250 --> 34:44.416
Yeah.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.416
His name's Bowdrie,
but I call him Bo.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.500
His old man was a huge fan
of Louis L'Amour.

34:50.666 --> 34:52.541
You ever heard of him?

34:52.708 --> 34:54.875
Oh, he's like
this old cowboy writer.

34:55.041 --> 34:56.791
He wrote a bunch
of Western stories.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.416
Anyway. There's this character
in one of them named Bowdrie.

34:59.583 --> 35:02.125
And Pa-paw liked it
so much that he stole it.

35:02.291 --> 35:06.916
So it's...
it's an homage.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.000
Why not call him Dad?

35:15.125 --> 35:17.375
I just always called him Bo,
I guess.

35:18.791 --> 35:22.125
I mean, that that is his name.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.500
What about Tag?
What is that from?

35:30.041 --> 35:33.375
He says that momma used
to always call me his--
his tag along.

35:33.958 --> 35:38.583
And I like that more than my
other name, so it stuck.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.541
[chuckles softly]

35:58.291 --> 35:59.583
[leaves rustling]

36:14.208 --> 36:15.583
-Uh...
-What is it?

36:16.708 --> 36:18.958
Nothing, I'm just--
I thought I...

36:20.000 --> 36:21.333
It's all good.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.291
[sighs heavily]

36:28.666 --> 36:31.416
Oh, hey. You're up.

36:31.583 --> 36:33.208
-Yeah.
-Good.

36:41.041 --> 36:42.666
Are you mad at me?

36:43.500 --> 36:44.541
No.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.000
She had to go
to the bathroom.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.833
I was trying
to do your sheets a favor.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.125
Gee, thanks a lot, Tag.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.916
Well, like I said,
we don't know her.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.458
I know her.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.833
Why don't you go
and get washed for dinner?

37:01.041 --> 37:04.833
[Bowdrie]
Lord,
we thank You for this food
and this warm home.

37:05.458 --> 37:08.666
We ask Your forgiveness
just like we forgive others.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.458
We ask for guidance, Lord.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.458
But above all,
Your will be done.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.125
Nothing more, nothing less.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.875
In your name. Amen.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.375
-[girls] Amen.
-Right.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.916
[sighs]

37:49.583 --> 37:50.625
Hey!

37:51.791 --> 37:52.958
Hey!

38:01.791 --> 38:02.916
Thank you.

38:06.333 --> 38:11.125
Yeah. You got a ways to go,
but you'll be fine.
I've seen much worse.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.500
Smoke?

38:15.041 --> 38:16.416
Yeah.

38:32.666 --> 38:34.083
-It's cold.
-Yeah.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.875
It's gonna be
a hard winter.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.625
[Tag] Night, Bo.

38:41.958 --> 38:43.041
Night, kid.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.666
[Tag] Night, January.

38:45.416 --> 38:46.458
Good night.

38:48.958 --> 38:51.625
-She's sweet.
-Yeah, she's all right.

38:58.916 --> 39:00.250
What are you gonna do?

39:04.208 --> 39:06.000
I'll take you
into town tomorrow.

39:07.958 --> 39:09.291
They got a clinic in Antlers.

39:09.458 --> 39:10.958
They'll take
good care of you there.

39:21.708 --> 39:22.833
Okay.

Hey, yo, Alejandro.

40:23.125 --> 40:25.083
-Yeah, baby.
-[door opens]

40:33.125 --> 40:34.125
It's Irish.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.333
They just brought Jensen in.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.291
Can you feel that?

40:42.458 --> 40:44.208
What a stupid mistake.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.166
Fucking stupid.
Are you stupid?

40:47.333 --> 40:48.958
-I didn't tell anyone.
I swear.
-Yeah, you did.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.791
You know you're fucking dead.

40:51.333 --> 40:53.083
-Pay attention.
-Okay.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.958
[siren wailing
in the distance]

40:55.875 --> 40:57.291
Why did you do it?

40:57.625 --> 40:59.208
I was coming back.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.500
I was coming back.

41:03.083 --> 41:05.791
-I swear.
-Why did you fucking do it?

41:08.541 --> 41:10.375
-Look at me.
-I...

41:11.041 --> 41:12.583
I can explain this.

41:13.875 --> 41:15.125
All of it.

41:15.791 --> 41:17.750
[Irish] Good luck
explaining this.

41:20.625 --> 41:21.875
Did you get my shit?

41:22.041 --> 41:26.000
No, I fucking did
what I was told to do.

41:26.166 --> 41:27.458
All right?

41:29.666 --> 41:31.375
This is just
a misunderstanding.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.708
They're putting it on me, man.
But it's just...

41:34.875 --> 41:37.125
It's a mis--
It's a misunderstanding.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.291
Look at me.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.791
Look at me.

41:46.125 --> 41:48.583
-Damn!
-That was a nice hit.

41:50.125 --> 41:51.541
All right, cowboy.

41:52.333 --> 41:53.791
Get up now.

41:53.958 --> 41:56.125
The Academy taught you better
than that, boy.

41:56.583 --> 41:58.833
You a tough guy.
Hang in there.

41:59.916 --> 42:02.958
[Jensen] I swear to you,
I swear I did the drop.

42:03.125 --> 42:05.166
[coughing, spitting]

42:06.083 --> 42:07.708
I did the drop.

42:09.583 --> 42:12.958
And it wasn't light, man,
it wasn't like. I swear.

42:13.125 --> 42:18.125
Running for me is like
running from God.

42:19.541 --> 42:21.125
I have eyes everywhere.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.208
So what do you
want to do now?

42:24.208 --> 42:25.750
Did you get the wife?

42:26.083 --> 42:27.291
In the trunk...

42:27.458 --> 42:29.416
-[muffled screaming]
-...with the kid.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.625
[Alejandro] You hear that?
We got your wife.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.708
We got your fucking wife.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.250
Tell me. Tell me.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.291
[sighs]

42:50.791 --> 42:52.125
Tell me...

42:53.791 --> 42:55.166
Tell me.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.000
What is her name?

42:59.958 --> 43:02.125
-[muffled screaming]
-[metallic thud]

43:02.916 --> 43:04.625
Laney. Laney.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.291
Laney?

43:09.625 --> 43:11.291
[speaking in Spanish]

43:12.708 --> 43:17.041
And Laney
won't like it at first.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.291
She'll try to fight it.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.958
[Jensen sobbing]

43:29.916 --> 43:31.041
I was...

43:33.166 --> 43:36.541
poor, abandoned, lost.

43:37.333 --> 43:38.541
Orphan...

43:41.708 --> 43:44.583
Going to the worst.

43:47.333 --> 43:51.583
the worst place
you could ever imagine.

43:52.291 --> 43:53.375
-[sighs]
-Ever.

43:57.583 --> 44:00.500
I'm gonna do to her
what those people did to me.

44:01.958 --> 44:02.958
Inside.

44:04.083 --> 44:06.166
Please. Please.

44:08.916 --> 44:10.416
I'm sorry, man,
I fucked up.

44:11.083 --> 44:12.708
I fucked up.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.416
I know it's my fault.

44:14.583 --> 44:16.958
Don'-- Don't hurt them.
Please, God.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.875
You smell like death.

44:21.750 --> 44:22.916
You don't have to do nothing.

44:24.208 --> 44:25.500
No, I can--
I can still...

44:25.666 --> 44:27.041
No, I can still help you,
I can--

44:27.208 --> 44:28.833
[Alejandro] We took care
of your little lover.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.500
[Jensen] I can drive,
I can make the runs,
I can...

44:30.666 --> 44:32.750
-Please.
-Now it's your turn.

44:32.916 --> 44:35.375
-Oh, God.
-Stop.

44:35.541 --> 44:37.625
No! God! No!
[sobbing]

44:37.791 --> 44:39.125
No more suffering.

Coward!

-[Jensen screaming] No!

44:43.833 --> 44:45.416
[high-pitched scream]

44:53.958 --> 44:56.625
Hm... January is sleeping.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.500
Well, that's good.
That's God's medicine.

44:58.666 --> 45:00.291
That's what you Pa-paw
always used to say.

45:00.458 --> 45:01.458
Yes, sir.

45:01.625 --> 45:02.958
Speaking of old guys,

45:03.125 --> 45:04.208
you ought to ride up
to old Whitehorse's,

45:04.375 --> 45:05.583
see if he's okay.

45:05.750 --> 45:06.875
I haven't seen him
for a few days.

45:07.666 --> 45:11.708
I thought I was supposed
to stay around the house.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.375
You're going the opposite way
away from the river,
so I figure it'd be all right.

45:15.416 --> 45:16.583
I'll take the truck.

45:17.166 --> 45:18.416
Oh, no, I need the truck.

45:19.708 --> 45:21.291
-You need it?
-Mm-hm.

45:22.375 --> 45:23.375
It looks like rain.

45:23.541 --> 45:25.000
Well, you could use the shower.

45:25.541 --> 45:28.041
Anyway, the fork's low,
apple butter.

45:30.333 --> 45:32.458
Might as well treat myself
on my birthday.

45:32.625 --> 45:34.625
-Which birthday again?
-Who's counting?

45:34.791 --> 45:36.583
You better slow down
on them birthdays.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.500
You'd be 42 by next month.

46:04.666 --> 46:05.875

It's gonna be all right,
you know.

[♪♪♪]

46:45.125 --> 46:46.416

46:57.041 --> 46:59.000
You may want
to stay inconspicuous.

47:00.416 --> 47:01.875
I'll be right back.

47:10.541 --> 47:13.166
Can't resist
the smell of bacon.
What's going on?

47:13.333 --> 47:15.458
This world
ain't right for it.

47:16.250 --> 47:20.291
Body washed up down the river.
Just got the call.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.250
One of our boys.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.125
Oh, yeah. County.
Which one?

47:25.291 --> 47:26.916
Name o' Jensen. Deputy.

47:27.083 --> 47:28.166
Three years.

47:28.333 --> 47:29.833
They tortured him
with a drill.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.333
Dozen holes in him.

47:32.375 --> 47:35.208
Beaten, shot, dropped
in the upper river last night.

47:35.375 --> 47:37.208
-Yeah. Sorry.
-The wife and kid...

47:37.375 --> 47:39.916
Missing. Can't even get 'em
on the phone.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.291
Have you seen anything
weird out there?

47:43.708 --> 47:45.250
You've been down at the Fork?

47:46.166 --> 47:48.041
Nothing.
It's all pretty quiet.

47:52.291 --> 47:53.750
This morning,

47:53.916 --> 47:56.708
body of an Antler's girl
got caught in the trotline

47:56.875 --> 47:58.291
down at Broken Bow Lake.

47:59.208 --> 48:00.541
Shot in the head.

48:00.708 --> 48:03.333
Looks like she came
up through the Fork.

48:03.625 --> 48:05.625
Through the delta,
caught in the shallows.

48:06.958 --> 48:10.666
Turns out she disappeared
from her apartment
a few nights back.

48:10.833 --> 48:12.583
Roommate's gone missing too.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.791
She turn up yet?

48:16.000 --> 48:17.958
God, no. Hope she's alive.

48:18.833 --> 48:20.041
[Bowdrie] Right.

48:20.208 --> 48:21.750
Yeah.

48:21.916 --> 48:24.625
[Brake] Word is,
the Brotherhood
and the cartel

48:24.791 --> 48:26.416
have joined forces
here in town.

48:26.583 --> 48:28.541
You don't want to mess
with these breed of people.

48:28.708 --> 48:30.791
-Bad dudes.
-I'm planning on it.

48:32.291 --> 48:33.708
You see anything upriver?

48:34.041 --> 48:36.833
Yeah, I found some tracks.
Might be something.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.333
Bit of a hike, though.

48:38.500 --> 48:39.625
About a mile or so.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.125
Do me a favor.

48:41.541 --> 48:44.000
Keep Tag off the river
till we get this settled.

48:44.166 --> 48:45.458
[Bowdrie] Yeah.

48:45.625 --> 48:47.750
-[Brake] People are crazy.
-[Bowdrie] Yeah.

48:48.208 --> 48:51.083
[Brake] Fucking Brotherhood,
cartels.

48:51.250 --> 48:52.416
Indians, Russians

48:52.583 --> 48:55.208
running heroin, meth.
Fuck!

48:55.916 --> 48:58.250
People now, kids.

48:58.750 --> 49:00.166
It's all gone to shit.

49:01.291 --> 49:02.291
Hm.

49:03.541 --> 49:04.875
[Brake] What you got there?

49:05.375 --> 49:06.583
[Bowdrie] Oh, yeah.

49:06.750 --> 49:10.041
She's a niece
from out of town.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.791
She's come to visit Tag
for her birthday.

49:14.125 --> 49:15.583
-Do yourself a favor.
-Mm-hm.

49:15.750 --> 49:16.583
Get the hell out of here.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.375
Good advice. Good luck.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.541
What the hell's going on?

49:24.208 --> 49:26.583
[Bowdrie]
I'm getting the sense you're
not telling me everything.

49:26.750 --> 49:27.750
[engine turning over]

49:31.291 --> 49:33.166
What do you know about
this crew here in town?

49:33.333 --> 49:34.541
This Brotherhood?

49:35.750 --> 49:36.958
[January]
I don't know them...

49:41.833 --> 49:43.083
but I saw their face.

49:43.250 --> 49:44.583
[Lizzie] I don't know.
I don't know.

49:44.750 --> 49:45.958
He didn't tell me.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.166
[Irish] That's a real
fucking problem.

49:47.333 --> 49:49.041
I swear to you, I swear.

49:49.208 --> 49:51.750
He's married.
We haven't talked.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.708
Fuck. Make the call.

49:53.875 --> 49:55.625
[Lizzie] No. No, no, no.

49:55.791 --> 49:59.791
I swear we haven't talked
in three weeks.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.375
Jensen's not here.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.875
Only his girlfriend
and a roommate.

50:05.625 --> 50:06.791
[Koontz] What?

50:07.208 --> 50:09.416
-He said clean it up.
-Oh, no.

50:09.583 --> 50:11.416
No. Please, please,
please don't hurt us.

50:11.583 --> 50:13.541
Please. Please.

50:13.916 --> 50:16.291
[sobbing] Please. Please.

50:18.875 --> 50:20.333
[Irish] Muzzle that bitch.

Tell Egon
to bring the car around.

50:32.083 --> 50:33.125
[faint groaning]

50:33.291 --> 50:34.666
[Koontz] Hey, baby.

50:37.750 --> 50:39.541
You're January, huh?

50:40.333 --> 50:41.666
Look at me.

50:44.125 --> 50:47.750
Yeah. You know
what we're looking for?

50:49.166 --> 50:52.916
Hm? No, no.

50:53.958 --> 50:55.708
Yeah. [shushing]

50:56.416 --> 50:57.500
I believe you.

50:58.208 --> 51:00.458
You shouldn't have
come home, bitch.

51:05.916 --> 51:07.000
I'm sorry.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.125

[Tag]
Do you have any family?

52:20.833 --> 52:23.500
Uh... I got a brother
in North Carolina.

52:23.666 --> 52:24.958
We don't talk much.

52:27.041 --> 52:28.125
Husband?

52:29.208 --> 52:30.583
Mm-mm.

52:32.291 --> 52:33.333
Boyfriend?

52:33.500 --> 52:36.250
-[chuckles]
-Not for a while.

52:37.875 --> 52:39.416
-Kids?
-Tag.

52:39.916 --> 52:44.125
I'm just trying to see
if anyone's worried about her.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.250
[January] Hm.

52:46.416 --> 52:49.291
No. I don't really
have anybody.

52:49.458 --> 52:51.750
I just came down
from Wilmington...

52:51.916 --> 52:54.375
for a guy,
that was dumb.

52:56.708 --> 52:58.416
I met Lizzie at work,
and...

53:00.833 --> 53:03.083
She offered to pay
half rent or whatever.

53:03.250 --> 53:06.166
Um, but I just keep
to myself, mostly.

53:07.458 --> 53:08.708
I don't really
have anybody.

53:10.166 --> 53:11.416
Neither do me and Bowdrie.

She's alive.

53:37.541 --> 53:39.125

-Shit.

53:39.291 --> 53:41.375
[mumbles indistinctly]

53:45.208 --> 53:47.916
Didn't I tell you
to take care of it?

53:49.333 --> 53:50.500
So, you...

53:51.208 --> 53:53.541
You, open your mouth.

-Open your mouth.

54:01.250 --> 54:02.458
Alejandro!

54:02.625 --> 54:04.291
[Alejandro] Uh, uh, uh...

54:07.875 --> 54:12.250
This is what you're supposed
to do when I say
end a motherfucker.

54:13.666 --> 54:16.250
You put her on her knees.

54:16.416 --> 54:18.000
[Koontz] Alejandro.
No, please.

54:18.166 --> 54:21.333
And you end it,
end it, end it, end it.

54:23.291 --> 54:24.625
I'll take care of it.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.958
All right.

54:47.708 --> 54:49.375
[chuckles softly]

54:56.458 --> 54:59.041
-[January] What is it?
-I don't know.

55:12.208 --> 55:13.333
[Irish] Oi, oi!

55:14.916 --> 55:16.166
Can I help you?

55:16.333 --> 55:17.625
Is this the Johnson place?

55:18.375 --> 55:20.041
-No.
-Oh, shite.

55:20.791 --> 55:23.750
So this ain't 1436
Kickapoo Place?

55:24.375 --> 55:26.166
-[Bowdrie] Is that
the Johnson place?
-Right.

55:27.041 --> 55:28.666
Well, I already told you
that it wasn't.

55:29.291 --> 55:31.083
Yes, sir. I guess you did.

55:32.416 --> 55:35.708
Look, I ain't gonna
bullshit a bullshitter.

55:35.875 --> 55:38.916
I'm out here in the fucking
asshole of nowhere.

55:41.666 --> 55:43.000
Is that them?

55:43.791 --> 55:45.291
I don't know,
I can't see anything.

[gun cocking]

55:49.166 --> 55:50.375
What are you doing?

55:51.875 --> 55:53.541
Do you know how to use a gun?

55:54.416 --> 55:56.125
-Uh-uh.
-[gun clicks]

55:58.000 --> 55:59.166
Just in case.

56:04.208 --> 56:05.708
[Irish] I'm trying
to find my sister.

56:05.875 --> 56:08.750
You see, I got word
that she came up the river

56:09.750 --> 56:13.458
and went camping with some
prick called Johnson,

56:13.625 --> 56:15.208
and they got into
some bother.

56:16.833 --> 56:18.958
I'm sorry.
I hope you find her.

56:20.666 --> 56:22.000
She's a pretty girl.

56:22.458 --> 56:25.291
A couple of tattoos,
dark hair.

56:26.041 --> 56:27.541
Her name's January.

56:27.708 --> 56:29.083
Like the month.

56:29.250 --> 56:30.625
Doesn't ring a bell.

56:31.541 --> 56:32.750
Okay.

56:34.291 --> 56:36.208
I don't think you understand.

56:36.541 --> 56:39.458
I really
need to find my sister.

56:40.291 --> 56:42.125
You haven't seen her
or talked to her?

56:42.291 --> 56:43.750
-I'm pretty sure.
-I'm pretty sure.

56:45.083 --> 56:46.166
Right.

56:47.625 --> 56:48.875
We got a problem then,

56:49.041 --> 56:52.666
because I don't think
I believe you.

56:57.125 --> 56:58.458
All right.

[Tag] Hey, Bowdrie.

-Hey.

57:04.166 --> 57:05.541
Your dinner's getting cold.

57:05.708 --> 57:07.250
[Bowdrie] Oh, you get
started without me?

57:09.500 --> 57:11.375
-I'm tired of waiting.
-[Bowdrie] Well, don't wait.

57:11.541 --> 57:13.666
Say grace. Dig in.
I'll be in directly.

57:13.833 --> 57:16.541
Cute girl. Big mouth.

57:20.083 --> 57:21.333
[chuckles]

57:21.500 --> 57:23.041
I won't push my luck.

57:23.666 --> 57:26.375
Don't let me keep you
from a hot fucking meal.

57:26.541 --> 57:29.125
Sounds like the princess
means business.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.083
Look, I'll...

57:33.250 --> 57:36.041
I'll keep looking and digging
for my little sister.

57:36.875 --> 57:38.500
I'm sure she'll pop up.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.333
See you soon.

[car door closes]

57:52.041 --> 57:53.833
[Tag] Is that them?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.458
[Bowdrie] Yeah.

57:56.541 --> 58:00.375
Well, why didn't you shoot them
for what they did to January?

58:00.541 --> 58:01.666
It's not our fight.

58:03.916 --> 58:05.000
Let's get inside.

59:31.250 --> 59:32.500
I wanna go home, bitch.

Best put that shit down,

59:39.541 --> 59:41.791
-Fucking up.
-How many you got out here?

59:45.125 --> 59:47.708

how many we got in there.

You don't even matter.
That's what's crazy.

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:08.416
But you had to fight.

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:10.833

so fucking hard, didn't you?

to get rid of their truck.

You didn't have to.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:40.125
Bo thinks that you
ripped your stitches out.

It's okay.

01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:52.625

What?

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:57.583
I was really, really scared,
so I froze.

Tag, no.

01:04:01.666 --> 01:04:02.791

-I need to go.
-Where are you going?

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:20.333
You need a stitch
or two there.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500
You could take me
to the clinic.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.416
Come here.
Sit down, please.

01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:27.000
Please.

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:33.250
[grunts softly]

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.000
You need to tell me everything.

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:50.458
That guy I told you about
that Lizzie was seeing.

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.000
That's Jensen, that cop.

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.708
But... [sighs]

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.250
They were just--

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.000
I don't know,
it wasn't serious,
I didn't--

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:07.833
I never talked to him.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.125
I don't trust cops.

01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:15.125
She did tell me that he
was involved in some shit.

01:05:15.291 --> 01:05:17.166
I was scared.
I just didn't...

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:23.875
I don't even know you.

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:25.416
And you saved my life.

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:26.916
And I owe you for that.

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:28.333
You don't owe me nothing.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.125
I never would have stayed here
if I knew they'd come.

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:42.791
I wouldn't have done that
to you and Tag.

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:44.833
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:48.500
They almost--

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.625
Just take me somewhere.
Anywhere.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.916
Drop me off.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.333
They're gonna
keep coming back.

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:58.875
Jensen was afraid of him.
I'm in the mix now.

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:01.250
I saw Lizzie die.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.791
Clearly, they want me dead.

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.250
I cannot do that to y'all.

about to tell you has to
stay quiet, all right?

All right.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:50.958
[Bowdrie]
I need your word.

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:53.083
[Brake]
What is it?

01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:58.125
[Bowdrie]
That girl washed up
down at Broken Bow.

01:06:58.916 --> 01:07:00.416
[Brake]
That's right.
What about her?

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.708
Now where are you
at with all that?

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:05.583
I know she was executed.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:09.041
That deputy, Jensen,
we fished out of the fork.

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:11.041
He was connected to her.

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.500
Found text messages,
pictures...

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:17.291
He was compromised.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.291
I always had
a feeling about him.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.125
Too friendly with girls,
too much of a fucking bully.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.625
Ain't out yet,
but we're finding shit.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:32.583

of Arkansas looks like.

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.291
His wife and kid
are still missing.

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:38.958
His crew, who are they?

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:41.125
They're scary motherfuckers,
that's who they are.

with the Brotherhood, cartel.

No sense in it.

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.458
Yeah, Bowdrie?

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:00.875
Get to it.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.541
You know something,
you gotta talk to me.

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.541

went missing.

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:06.375
That's right. Evers.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.583
Collateral damage
most likely.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.125
I got her.

01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:12.333
-What did you say?
-I got her.

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.083
She washed up
out of the river.
Tag found her.

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:16.333
She's alive?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
-Where is she?
-She's safe.

01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:19.666
Not for long, she ain't.

01:08:19.833 --> 01:08:22.625
You understand
what kind of mess
this girl is in?

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:26.416
These people,
they got their
own laws out there.

01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:28.958
God-dang animals.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.708
Where is she?

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.333
She's scared the hell out of
is where she's at.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
Now, we already know
we can't trust the cops.

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:38.416
But I will bring her to you.

01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:40.708
But you got to keep
Tag and me out of this,
all right?

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:43.416
I don't want no reports,
no questions, no nothing.

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:46.291
She washed up a few miles
down the bend and...

01:08:46.458 --> 01:08:48.083
And that's the end of it.
Okay?

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.583
We cannot be dragged into this.
I can't be part of it.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:51.958
Tag can't be drug in.

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:53.250
Damn right, you can't.

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:55.083
[grunts softly]

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.750
You got to get her
out of here.

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.000
All right.

01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:01.625
I'll drive her over
a few counties.

01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.750
Down here,
we're all too damn related.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.958
They're gonna
take good care of you.

01:09:08.125 --> 01:09:10.000
I know Bowdrie
doesn't look smart,

01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.208
but he is.

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.125
Get you fixed up.

01:09:19.708 --> 01:09:21.083
You're pretty awesome.

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.250
You know that, right?

01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:30.625
-[door clicks open]
-Couldn't remember
if I'd told you that.

01:09:34.583 --> 01:09:37.625
Okay. He's gonna
take you to a safe place.

01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:39.000
That gets you
out of county,

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:40.791
and you can
figure it out from there.

01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:42.958
Right?

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:45.208
-That's the only way
this works.
-Okay.

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:46.458
Okay.

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:49.416
Tag, I need a minute.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.416
I'll meet you out
at the truck.

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:53.791
I'll miss you.

01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:00.250
Thanks.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:04.041
You're...

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:06.333
-Here, hang on to this.
-What is it?

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.791
That's just a little something
to hold you over until you,

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:10.500
you know,
get on your feet again.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.625
You can trust this fella.

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:15.708
I trust you.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.541
Okay.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:21.708
Well, we best get going.

01:10:22.958 --> 01:10:25.041
[♪♪♪]

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.708
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:52.625
[Bowdrie]
In Your holy name
we pray. Amen.

01:12:22.541 --> 01:12:23.916
[sighs]

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.708
[Bowdrie]
We didn't
have a choice.

01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:30.916
[Tag]
Neither did she.

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:33.375
[Bowdrie]
Well,
the world's tough that way.

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.791
Sometimes we don't get
to pick what we want to do.

01:12:39.083 --> 01:12:40.500
You know that.

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:45.000
Sometimes we just
have to do
what we have to.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:48.541
[Tag]
I liked having
January here.

01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:52.833
It reminded me of what it might
be like if Mama were around.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.875
-Just the three of us?
-Yeah. All right.

01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:57.250
It's true.

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:02.375
Baby, you never even
really knew your Mama.

01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:03.833
You were too little.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.958
And she was so lost
before she passed.

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:13.333
January trusted us.

01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:17.541
The only thing I care about
in this whole wide world

01:13:17.708 --> 01:13:20.416
is you...
keeping you safe.

01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:24.625
And nothing's gonna
stop me from doing that.
Not her, not you.

01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.375
Why don't you go back inside
and be ready?

01:13:29.166 --> 01:13:30.875
No...

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:40.291

Sleep all right?

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:35.583
Yeah. Me neither.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.458
Hey, let's go check in
with Brake.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.500
[line ringing]

01:14:57.666 --> 01:14:59.041
[Brake]
This is Sheriff Brake.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.125
If this is emergency,
please call 911.

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:03.000
Otherwise, leave your name
and number after the beep.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.750
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:11.458
[line ringing]

01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:15.625
[Brake]
This is Sheriff Brake.

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:18.000
If this is an emergency,
please call 911.

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:24.541
[engine turning over]

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:43.375
[grunts softly]
Uh, go on in.

01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:45.083
Don't come out
for nobody, okay?

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.333
I wanna stay with you.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.291
[sighs] Here.

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:51.333
Go on in, please. Here,
get something you want?

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.833
I wanna speak to Brake.
Is he in?

01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:24.541
[boy] Hey.

01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:25.875
Can I help you
with something?

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.750
No, thank you.

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.083
Well, if you do need me,
I'll just--

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.791
I'll just be right there
at the counter--

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:32.458
Billy Ray,
there's a clean-up
on aisle two.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.250
[indistinct conversations]

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:45.041
Hey, where's Brake?

01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:48.166
-Let's take a walk.
-Sure.

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:49.916
[Davenport]
Nobody knows.
He was a no-show today.

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.416
So I blew up his phone,
got his voicemail.

01:16:52.583 --> 01:16:53.750
Called his wife,
and she said he

01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:55.125
didn't come home
last night.

01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.291
-So...
-Uh-huh.

01:16:56.458 --> 01:16:58.125
Nobody knows where he is.

01:16:58.291 --> 01:16:59.416
Huh? No idea?

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.291
Look, I know you, uh...

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:02.875
you guys are boys
or whatever,

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:06.208
but, I need you
to cut the shit, okay?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.416
There's a lot of talk.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:09.500
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:10.875
Well, you know,

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:13.500
the Jensen case
and the dead girl.

01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:16.708
You know, there's some theories
that Brake might be involved.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:19.041
Now, see, I'm new here,
so that's just my perspective.

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:20.416
And to me, it seems that--

01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:22.333
Well, everybody's related.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.500
This department is
full of cousin fuckers

01:17:24.666 --> 01:17:26.166
and 30-year favors.

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:29.541
Now, now, I don't
think like that. Just...

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:31.416
There's a lot of talk.

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:33.625
I've known the man 35 years.
That doesn't fit the picture.

01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:36.208
Yeah. Maybe he just
got tired of the bullshit

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:37.791
and owed somebody
some money or something.

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:39.166
Or maybe he just didn't
want to retire with some

01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:41.000
shitty pension
and a big ol' gut.

01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:42.250
[chuckles]
Right, yeah.

01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:44.125
I mean, I get it,
I get it.

01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:47.250
I respect the guy.
I guess, you know,
he was tired.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:49.958
Well, I'll try and get
in touch with him later.

01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:52.333
So what is it that--
that you needed, though?

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.000
-Just...
-Nothing. Just to talk.

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:56.833
Is there something
in particular,
though, maybe?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.625
You know, because
from what I've heard
about you is

01:17:58.791 --> 01:18:00.083
is that you're
the type of guy that

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.875
doesn't really need anything.

01:18:02.041 --> 01:18:04.583
-Nope.
-Okay. Hey, you were--

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.083
you were with him
yesterday, weren't you?

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.583
-I was.
-Yeah.

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.333
Yeah, 'cause I was there
when you called him saying

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.458
you had to meet up over
at Lucille's Coffee Shop.

01:18:12.625 --> 01:18:14.166
-Mm-hm.
-Yeah. Mm!

01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:17.041
I haven't seen him
after that.

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:18.583
Or maybe there's something
that you know

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:20.500
that maybe you wanna--
wanna tell me.

01:18:20.666 --> 01:18:22.416
-Nothing.
-No? Okay.

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:24.000
What is it you needed though?
Come on.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.208
Well, I just check in
on him from time to time.

01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:27.625
It's one of those times.

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:28.791
It's one of those times.

01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:32.458
Okay, well,
I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you what.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.625
Um, if I hear from Brake--
Or anybody for that matter,

01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:37.708
I'll make sure
I hit you up real quick.

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:39.041
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah.

01:18:39.833 --> 01:18:42.125
You know, there's a lot going
on in this town, isn't it?

01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:44.333
With Jensen and the girl
and...

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:46.083
People are crazy.

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.333
Hell, you got your hands full.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.875
Yeah, I sure do.
I sure do.

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:52.000
-Hey, uh-- Hey, Bowdrie?
-Yeah.

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.500
Don't say nothing
to nobody about this.

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:04.791
-Did you talk to Brake?
-Nope.

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:06.791
Hop in the truck,
we gotta go.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:23.625
What's going on?

01:19:23.791 --> 01:19:26.083
Brake's dead, Tag.
They killed him.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:28.500
And I'm damn sure
there's more men
coming here right now.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:30.125
What about January?

conclusions now, okay?

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.541
She could be fine.

Where did they take her?

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:00.500
Oh, fuck you!

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:01.708
I'll make this
simple for you.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.500
Um...

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.791
You tell me
what I want to know
or I'll kill you.

01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:08.625
Okay, okay. Hold on.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:10.291
Hold. Just hold--
Hold the fuck on.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.583
-Okay.
-Just hold on one second.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.375
-Where is she?
-I can't think.

01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:15.833
Oh, that's where she is.
She's dead.

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:18.791
She's already dead. Yeah.
Sorry, you're fucked.

01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.541
No, no, no.
Stop! Stop!

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:23.041
-Please.
-Keep talking.

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:24.875
Okay, it was Brake.

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.875
Okay? He was trying
to fucking sneak off with her,

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:28.416
that fucking dumb
piece of shit.

01:22:28.583 --> 01:22:30.250
Okay?
He fucking knew better.

01:22:30.416 --> 01:22:32.041
It was his own damn
fucking fault.

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:33.958
-Is he dead?
-Yeah.

01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:35.666
Who killed him? You?

01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:38.458
Yeah. I fucking
killed him. Okay.

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:39.958
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:41.625
Okay! Fuck!

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.083
-Where's January?
-Fuck.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.833
I took her to the compound.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.833
Okay, the brother's wandering
the fucking compound.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.458
-So I took her there.
-Is she alive?

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.791
If she was, she's wishing
right now that...

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:52.791
that she wasn't.

01:22:53.208 --> 01:22:56.208
Listen, Alejandro, just--
He wanted that bitch, man.

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:58.333
-And, well,
he fucking got her.
-Where's the compound?

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.416
It's fucking over, man.
It's fucking over.

01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:02.500
-Where's the compound?
-I'm just doing
what I had to do, man.

01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:04.500
Fuck. I'm a runner, okay?

01:23:04.666 --> 01:23:08.208
I come here to make sure
that fucking shit runs right.

01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:09.458
Do you understand me?

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:11.000
I'm not supposed
to be dealing

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.750
with that
fucking shit right now!

01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:14.750
-Let me out of here!
-Where's the com--

01:23:14.916 --> 01:23:16.958
-Look, what is wrong
with you?
-Ahh!

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.083
If you had a lawn mower
in my face,
I'd be telling you everything.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.208
[screaming] Fuck!

[Davenport grunts]

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.458
Oh, I see the problem.
It's a spark plug.

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:28.166
-What?
-I should have that
fixed in a jiffy.

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:30.291
-Oh, it'll work now.
-No!

-Fuck!
-Hey, relax.

01:23:34.666 --> 01:23:36.000
-Fuck you.
-I'm just gonna
take a little off the top.

01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:37.666
No, no, no, no!

01:23:42.416 --> 01:23:45.416
Ah! Fuck!
I'll fucking tell you.

01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:48.375
Okay, okay, okay,
I'll take you to
the fucking compund.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.083
All right, let's get to it.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:00.333
[Bowdrie]
Dear Tag.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:05.125
Kid, you are
the best part of my life.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:09.666
And I have loved
every second with you.

01:24:09.833 --> 01:24:12.208
Every second,
every minute,
every day.

01:24:14.166 --> 01:24:17.625
A long time ago,
I told you a lie.

01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:20.041
I did it to protect you.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:23.541
But maybe
I was just scared.

01:24:24.458 --> 01:24:26.125
Maybe I was just trying
to protect myself.

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.958
I don't know anymore.

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:31.541
I was never scared
before you were born.

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.416
Then the day you came...

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:35.666
Well, I learned different.

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:39.500
You always believed
your mom was dead.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:41.875
But she's not.

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:44.916
She's been imprisoned for
doing some horrible things,

01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:48.166
but she's
a different person now.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:52.125
Last four months, every week
since she got out of jail,

01:24:52.291 --> 01:24:54.000
she's been
sending you letters.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.333
She misses you,
and she loves you.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:00.416
But I destroyed
those letters.

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:03.333
Each and every one
Because I didn't feel
that she deserved you

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.375
or your forgiveness
or your love

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:06.875
after what she had done.

01:25:07.833 --> 01:25:10.000
But maybe it was me
who didn't deserve you.

01:25:10.166 --> 01:25:12.541
The things I did
for what I've been--

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.083
A liar, a coward.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:15.708
Every day
I've lied to you

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:17.916
because I didn't
want you to be hurt.

01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:20.875
I thought I was
protecting you,
but I don't know.

01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:22.791
I hope someday
you can forgive me.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:24.875
You can take your time
about it.

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:28.083
I've never been
much for forgiving,

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:29.500
but I think you are.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.916
One of the things
I love about you.

01:25:33.666 --> 01:25:35.083
I'm gonna
check on our friend.

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:37.125
And, if you find this,

01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:39.500
it means it didn't go
so well as I hoped.

01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:41.208
And I'm sorry
for letting you down.

01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:42.916
[gun cocking]

01:25:43.166 --> 01:25:44.250
The cabin is yours.

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:47.000
You know
where the money is buried.

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:48.625
Don't spend it
all on dumb stuff.

01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:50.083
Take good care of the truck,

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:51.750
and she'll take
good care of you.

01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.958
Keep your gun clean.
Never stop drawing.

01:25:57.583 --> 01:26:02.125
The world is ugly,
but you are beautiful
and strong and good.

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:03.833
And good wins
down the line.

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:08.708
I love you forever.
Always have.

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:10.291

pardner.

01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:41.791
No, I'm lookin
for a friend.

01:27:41.958 --> 01:27:43.458
I know she's here.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.000
Friend?

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:49.875
We have no friends
here, cowboy.

01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:51.833
I can see that.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.375
Why don't we make this easy?

01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:55.125
Hand her over.

01:27:56.125 --> 01:27:57.875
Because, you know I'm not
going home without her.

01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:00.458
[Alejandro]
I know who you are.

01:28:00.625 --> 01:28:01.833
Flag him in the back.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.708
I sent some of my boys
out to you,

01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:09.166
and they never
came back home.

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.791
Did you kill them?

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:14.541
Look, I just want my friend.
I don't want any trouble.

01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:16.916
I figure I can make
a trade with this fella.

make a fucking trade?
