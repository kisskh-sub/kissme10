WEBVTT

00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:08.964
(A new younger man has
appeared in Yeon House.)

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:10.934
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.844
(The new younger man has
caught the older women's attention.)

00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:18.574
(My name is Yang Ji Yung.)

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:24.084
(An odd tension hangs in Yeon House.)

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.584
(Relaxed)

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.254
(Tonight, reveal your job.)

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:32.700
(With the appearance of the new man, )

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:35.064
(everyone must reveal their occupations.)

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:37.364
(I'm a doctor working
at an aesthetic clinic.)

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:38.994
(What?)

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:40.294
What is it?

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:42.334
I'm...

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:43.804
(I'm a public servant.)

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:49.344
(The men who only appeared
young have unexpected jobs.)

00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:53.474
(I'm a dentist.)

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:55.190
(From a dentist...)

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:56.774
(who graduated from SKY universities, )

00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:59.160
(to the principal ballerina of
the Korean National Ballet, )

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.530
(and even a veteran photographer)

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:03.284
(I'm a photographer.)

00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:06.654
(That's cool.)

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:09.370
(After revealing their jobs, )

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:12.134
(the atmosphere in Yeon House changed.)

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.980
(With the late-night date as a benefit, )

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.734
(Ji Yung chooses Bon Hee.)

00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:20.920
(Your skin...)

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.274
(By the way, your skin is amazing.)

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.250
(Even though it's their first encounter, )

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:28.614
(Ji Yung moves forward without hesitation.)

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:32.084
(The older women check the
younger men's feelings for the first time.)

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:36.900
(Ji Won wasn't chosen
by any of the younger men.)

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:39.254
(Ye Eun wasn't either.)

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:41.400
(You have received four Love QR message.)

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:44.940
(Meanwhile, the one who
received 4 Love QR messages...)

00:01:44.964 --> 00:01:46.810
(is Bon Hee.)

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.610
(I felt happy, and at the same time, )

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:51.474
(I felt confused.)

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.950
(Bon Hee, who received 4 votes, )

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:58.944
(is now being pursued by 4 younger men.)

00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:01.644
(And Sang Hyeon makes the first move.)

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:05.184
(No matter how it ends, )

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.684
(I should express my
feelings even if it's subtle.)

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:10.700
(Sang Hyeon musters
his courage for Bon Hee, )

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:12.394
(but how does Bon Hee feel?)

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:16.994
(That night, after checking the Love QR)

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.380
(Bon Hee was chosen by 4 out of 5 men.)

00:02:22.404 --> 00:02:24.234
- The Secret Room?
- The Secret Room?

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:27.110
(It only opens for the one...)

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:29.344
(who received the most Love QR messages.)

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:34.244
(Secret Room)

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:37.390
(Open the drawer and guess the
age of the person you're interested in.)

00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:38.814
(What you find out is a secret.)

00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:41.830
- It's because of that.
- The votes.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:42.960
Yes, she got many votes.

00:02:42.984 --> 00:02:44.900
(Bon Hee received 4 Love QR messages...)

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:47.054
(from Mu Jin, Sang Won,
Sang Hyeon, and Ji Yung.)

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.270
(Bon Hee, who got the majority of votes)

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:54.334
Let's see.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.104
Whose photo will she check?

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:02.044
(Mu Jin, whom she had her first date with?)

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.750
You didn't seem much older...

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.690
(Or Ji Yung, the newly joined catfish?)

00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:09.620
(Or those who sent unexpected messages, )

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.914
(Sang Hyeon and Sang Won?)

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:15.384
(Looking around)

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:19.700
(She heads to one
drawer without hesitation.)

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:21.024
She didn't hesitate at all.

00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:23.224
(Impressed)

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:27.040
- She's so happy.
- Isn't she smiling too much?

00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:29.334
(Whose photo did Bon Hee look at?)

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:35.074
(A cute child with chubby cheeks)

00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:37.620
- What?
- What? Who is that?

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:38.844
(Whose childhood photo is it?)

00:03:39.614 --> 00:03:43.290
(The child with the
cute chubby cheeks is...)

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:46.814
Mu Jin used to be cute and chubby.

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:49.100
(How cute.)

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:51.194
I really liked our first date,

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.524
and I'm more and more interested in Mu Jin.

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:57.564
That's why I wanted to know about him.

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:00.470
How cute.

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.480
(Mu Jin's photo is...)

00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:05.110
What? The date?

00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:07.234
(from 2007.)

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:09.874
- Is the date on it?
- He was such a baby in 2007?

00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:12.014
(SOOBIN)

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:13.650
Then how old is he?

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.960
How old do you think he was back then?

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:17.060
Ten or eleven.

00:04:17.084 --> 00:04:18.604
- Ten or eleven?
- That's what I think.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:21.054
Maybe upper elementary school.

00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:25.370
If we guess he was about 10 or 11...

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:26.894
Let's go back to 2007.

00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:30.934
In 2007, I was working
as a model in the US.

00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:32.770
I had been a model for eight years.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.464
Seul Hye would've been 29 years old.

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:37.610
Didn't you debut the next
year in "Crush and Blush?"

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.050
- Correct, that's when I debuted.
- What about you, Woo Young?

00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:41.320
I was 19.

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:42.450
(Mu Jin in 2007)

00:04:42.474 --> 00:04:44.314
- A trainee?
- I was training to be in 2PM.

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:46.390
Is he about the same age

00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:47.694
- as SOOBIN?
- Let's not ask him.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.730
We already have a big age difference.

00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:53.314
I had started elementary
school, so I was eight years old.

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.174
I told you we shouldn't ask, Seul Hye.

00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:57.424
That means he's older than SOOBIN, right?

00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:00.430
Don't you think he's about
two years older than me?

00:05:00.454 --> 00:05:01.524
- Right?
- Yes.

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:06.210
Last time Mu Jin saw Bon Hee's photo,

00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:09.034
- she was wearing a duffle coat.
- Yes.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.134
That photo was taken in 2004.

00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:13.310
Wasn't she in high school back then?

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:14.780
- If you put it like that...
- Back then,

00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:16.280
- A high school student?
- We thought she was in high school.

00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:17.890
A high school student in 2004.

00:05:17.914 --> 00:05:19.350
(Mu Jin in 2007, Bon Hee in 2004)

00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:21.790
If he was that young even though
her photo is from three years back...

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:22.960
Could there be a ten-year age gap?

00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:23.961
The gap might be bigger than we thought.

00:05:23.985 --> 00:05:25.484
This couple is at risk.

00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:27.014
Hold on a second.

00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:30.160
Last episode ended with
Sang Hyeon asking to talk to...

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:31.470
- Bon Hee.
- Yes.

00:05:31.494 --> 00:05:33.130
I was dying to know what they talked about.

00:05:33.154 --> 00:05:34.194
Right?

00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:38.334
(At that time, in the men's room)

00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:42.704
(Sang Hyeon is deep in thought.)

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:46.034
(Sighing)

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:50.944
(Sang Hyeon heads to the women's room?)

00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:53.590
(She spots Sang Hyeon.)

00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:55.290
- It's over.
- Sorry?

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:56.490
Everyone has left.

00:05:56.514 --> 00:05:58.954
I actually want to talk to Bon Hee.

00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:01.500
Can you tell her I'll be
waiting on the first floor?

00:06:01.524 --> 00:06:02.524
Sure thing.

00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.730
(Sang Hyeon asked to talk
to Bon Hee for the first time.)

00:06:05.754 --> 00:06:07.254
(Sighing)

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:10.201
Bon Hee, - Yes?

00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:12.370
Sang Hyeon wants to
talk to you on the first floor.

00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:14.264
- Sang Hyeon?
- He's waiting.

00:06:14.964 --> 00:06:15.940
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:16.964
Got it.

00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:21.774
Sang Hyeon?

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:25.790
Bon Hee is slightly surprised.

00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:27.344
Yes, she's like, "Sang Hyeon?"

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:35.830
(Sang Hyeon is waiting for
Bon Hee with excitement.)

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.224
(Sighing)

00:06:39.494 --> 00:06:41.894
I should express my
feelings even if it's subtle.

00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:45.334
Whatever happens,

00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:50.304
I thought I should talk
to her. So I went to her,

00:06:51.434 --> 00:06:52.550
and talked to her.

00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:54.854
(Sang Hyeon gathers his
courage to express his feelings.)

00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:57.320
Bon Hee must be feeling confused too.

00:06:57.344 --> 00:06:58.390
(Bon Hee walks toward Sang Hyeon.)

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:00.014
- She's bewildered.
- Exactly.

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:02.014
(Surprised)

00:07:03.614 --> 00:07:05.654
- Where do you want to go?
- I...

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.500
- Outside?
- Outside?

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:10.084
- I don't think it's too hot.
- Right.

00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:12.854
- The weather was actually nice.
- Right.

00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:17.970
(Sang Hyeon and Bon
Hee sit on the terrace.)

00:07:17.994 --> 00:07:20.070
What? Are they talking
somewhere with no cameras?

00:07:20.094 --> 00:07:21.854
(Sang Hyeon and Bon
Hee sit on the terrace.)

00:07:23.134 --> 00:07:24.450
(Thinking)

00:07:24.474 --> 00:07:25.704
What will he say?

00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:27.850
(Laughing)

00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:29.004
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:33.744
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Right.

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:34.814
I am

00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:38.754
not the type to talk in front of everyone.

00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:41.724
I felt sorry about it, so I
asked you to talk in private.

00:07:45.254 --> 00:07:48.594
I really liked the first
impression I had of you.

00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:51.934
But expressing my feelings right away

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:54.304
would have been too sudden.

00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:59.250
I thought it was better to
be sure of my feelings,

00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:02.744
and show them to you step by step.

00:08:04.044 --> 00:08:05.514
That's why

00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:08.360
I wanted to have a date with you today.

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:09.920
- You did?
- Yes.

00:08:09.944 --> 00:08:11.954
(I wanted to have a date with you today.)

00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:13.890
But I wasn't expressive at all.

00:08:13.914 --> 00:08:17.154
I slowly realized how bad I
was at showing my feelings.

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:21.364
I thought you probably had no idea.

00:08:22.664 --> 00:08:24.710
I wanted to have a light chat

00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:26.710
without putting any pressure on you.

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:30.164
But to be clear, my feelings aren't light.

00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:34.650
Thank you for being honest with me.

00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:36.244
But it never crossed my mind.

00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:38.014
I never thought this could happen.

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:40.814
That's why I was a little surprised,

00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:42.884
so I just listened.

00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:48.954
Do you know how INFPs flirt?

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:50.154
How?

00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:53.554
They hang around that
person while being dressed up.

00:08:56.664 --> 00:08:58.670
But it really never crossed my mind.

00:08:58.694 --> 00:09:00.194
When did you hang around me?

00:09:01.334 --> 00:09:03.740
The first time we sat
together, I sat across from you.

00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:04.874
- At first?
- Yes.

00:09:05.574 --> 00:09:07.950
When our eyes met and
we burst out laughing

00:09:07.974 --> 00:09:09.134
while you were eating apples?

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:12.620
- Was it Sang Hyeon?
- Yes, Sang Hyeon.

00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:15.190
- What's your name?
- I'm Gu Bon Hee.

00:09:15.214 --> 00:09:17.320
(On their 1st encounter
and on the 1st night, )

00:09:17.344 --> 00:09:19.514
(he sat across from Bon Hee.)

00:09:19.884 --> 00:09:21.460
(Glancing)

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:22.630
(Sang Hyeon secretly watched Bon Hee.)

00:09:22.654 --> 00:09:24.494
Sang Hyeon was already doing his best.

00:09:25.094 --> 00:09:26.794
It's just that Bon Hee had no idea.

00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.270
(Embarrassed when their eyes
met, Sang Hyeon laughed it off.)

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:35.604
(Flustered)

00:09:35.834 --> 00:09:38.104
I guess I am sitting
too directly across you.

00:09:38.304 --> 00:09:39.350
(Sang Hyeon was quietly
staying near Bon Hee.)

00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:40.604
Stop staring at him.

00:09:41.044 --> 00:09:42.980
(Happy)

00:09:43.004 --> 00:09:44.004
He's serious.

00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:47.760
It simply didn't reach you.

00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:48.844
Is that so?

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:51.854
I see.

00:09:52.854 --> 00:09:54.184
Did you get the text message?

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:56.624
What text message? The...

00:09:56.754 --> 00:09:58.494
Among the many text messages,

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:00.624
was this one in there?

00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:03.794
(Realizing)

00:10:05.094 --> 00:10:06.164
It was me.

00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:07.940
I had no idea.

00:10:07.964 --> 00:10:10.534
And I never thought you
would be the one who sent it.

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:14.350
- You keep going out.
- What?

00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:15.704
You keep going out.

00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:17.044
That...

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:21.844
You kept going out. I wanted to
talk to you, but you kept leaving.

00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:23.714
Please come back.

00:10:25.184 --> 00:10:26.254
That's what it meant.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.454
Come back.

00:10:28.854 --> 00:10:30.224
Please stay at home.

00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:34.624
When you said dating an
older woman was a challenge,

00:10:35.124 --> 00:10:37.540
- I thought maybe you weren't...
- Interested?

00:10:37.564 --> 00:10:39.534
Interested at all.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.334
Are you okay with someone
much older than you?

00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:46.204
- Than me?
- Much older.

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:47.504
- Much older?
- Yes.

00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:49.074
Much older.

00:10:52.114 --> 00:10:55.644
My feelings won't change.

00:10:56.744 --> 00:10:57.754
Just be you.

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:01.584
I hope we can go on a date.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.924
Shall we spend each day meaningfully?

00:11:05.594 --> 00:11:06.594
Of course.

00:11:09.524 --> 00:11:13.440
Wash up and go to sleep. I'm
sure there's an event tomorrow.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:14.441
For sure.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.710
- Goodnight.
- You too. Goodnight.

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:17.774
Bye.

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:29.290
(Their chat ended after
everyone had gone to bed.)

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.744
Bon Hee must be happy.

00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:37.894
My head was full of
thoughts and became a mess.

00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:42.124
He's quite bold.

00:11:42.464 --> 00:11:46.264
I was just as grateful as
the courage he showed me.

00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:48.304
And because of it,

00:11:48.634 --> 00:11:50.804
I wanted to know more about him.

00:11:52.904 --> 00:11:53.881
She wants to know more.

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:56.874
(Did Sang Hyeon's bravery
touch Bon Hee's heart?)

00:11:57.404 --> 00:11:58.974
(Amazed)

00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:00.820
She wants to know about him?

00:12:00.844 --> 00:12:02.484
Wanting to know about him

00:12:02.944 --> 00:12:04.414
means progress.

00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:07.354
What was it earlier? INFP flirting?

00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:09.460
- FP?
- Who's MBTI is INFP here?

00:12:09.484 --> 00:12:10.484
Not me.

00:12:10.684 --> 00:12:11.924
Why the straight face?

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:14.154
How is that flirting?

00:12:14.424 --> 00:12:15.440
(That's true.)

00:12:15.464 --> 00:12:18.970
It's my first time seeing someone
express their feelings like that.

00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:21.534
It felt like he was beating
around the bush at first.

00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:23.380
But it was actually straightforward.

00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:24.680
Totally, it was straightforward.

00:12:24.704 --> 00:12:26.050
"Do you know..."

00:12:26.074 --> 00:12:27.250
- "What I did next to you?"
- Right.

00:12:27.274 --> 00:12:28.794
"I've been doing this the whole time."

00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:30.151
It was like a confession.

00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:31.190
- Yes.
- Really?

00:12:31.214 --> 00:12:33.990
Honestly, I thought hanging
around while being dressed up

00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:35.314
was kind of weak.

00:12:35.614 --> 00:12:38.590
But by telling Bon Hee that
this was his way of flirting,

00:12:38.614 --> 00:12:41.160
it opened the door for her to wonder,

00:12:41.184 --> 00:12:43.230
- "Is he flirting with me?"
- Something like, "Is he?"

00:12:43.254 --> 00:12:45.824
When he's dressed up and
hanging around near her.

00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:47.624
Bon Hee will definitely be aware of it...

00:12:47.994 --> 00:12:49.894
- For sure.
- From now on.

00:12:50.324 --> 00:12:51.694
(That's possible.)

00:12:51.894 --> 00:12:53.410
I only have one.

00:12:53.434 --> 00:12:54.411
(How does Hye Jin flirt?)

00:12:54.435 --> 00:12:55.604
(Curious)

00:12:56.304 --> 00:12:57.564
I buy him expensive drinks.

00:12:57.804 --> 00:12:58.904
- You do?
- Yes.

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:00.734
Expensive food and drinks.

00:13:00.874 --> 00:13:02.220
- I think it's...
- That's so cool.

00:13:02.244 --> 00:13:03.750
Remember how I paid for our get-together?

00:13:03.774 --> 00:13:04.844
That's right!

00:13:06.174 --> 00:13:07.694
We drank soju-beer cocktails that day.

00:13:08.584 --> 00:13:09.720
- Come on.
- What?

00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:10.784
Nobody told you to.

00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:13.691
Okay.

00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:14.724
(Got it.)

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:16.660
(After the confusing night)

00:13:16.684 --> 00:13:18.054
It really was confusing.

00:13:18.524 --> 00:13:19.501
(The morning of day 3)

00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:20.900
- Day 3.
- It's only day 3,

00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:21.964
but it's already a war.

00:13:23.624 --> 00:13:24.994
(Breathing heavily)

00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:26.634
(Breathing heavily)

00:13:27.134 --> 00:13:28.134
Someone is working out.

00:13:32.074 --> 00:13:33.080
It's Ji Yung.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.604
(Ji Yung is back from a run.)

00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:39.190
(Workout equipment zone)

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:40.974
Ji Yung is very diligent.

00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:47.730
Since he's a professional athlete,

00:13:47.754 --> 00:13:51.054
he must have a set daily routine.

00:13:52.954 --> 00:13:53.970
(Breathing heavily)

00:13:53.994 --> 00:13:57.670
His body is different from someone
who just works out at a regular gym.

00:13:57.694 --> 00:13:59.234
- Right?
- It's the body of a warrior.

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:05.004
(Teto-guy Ji Yung starts
his day with a workout.)

00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:11.174
(His muscles are pumped up.)

00:14:11.244 --> 00:14:13.590
(Impressed)

00:14:13.614 --> 00:14:14.990
- That's wild.
- Unbelievable.

00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:16.220
Oh, my.

00:14:16.244 --> 00:14:18.114
(Mesmerized)

00:14:18.654 --> 00:14:21.524
(Meanwhile, in the older women's room, )

00:14:22.354 --> 00:14:27.754
(Yeong Gyeong and Ye Eun are finally up.)

00:14:28.464 --> 00:14:31.394
- No one came by, did they?
- What?

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:34.134
No, nobody stopped by.

00:14:35.364 --> 00:14:37.974
Yeong Gyeong, are you interested in anyone?

00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:42.550
Honestly, the only person I've talked to

00:14:42.574 --> 00:14:44.674
is Hyeon Jun.

00:14:45.444 --> 00:14:49.284
- True.
- So he's someone I'm interested in.

00:14:52.814 --> 00:14:55.400
But I never got the chance

00:14:55.424 --> 00:14:59.254
to talk to the others.

00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:02.164
I'm curious.

00:15:03.164 --> 00:15:04.694
I want to talk to them.

00:15:05.294 --> 00:15:08.610
- She wants to talk to the others.
- She's curious.

00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:09.864
In this situation,

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.174
it's likely she'll switch to another guy.

00:15:13.134 --> 00:15:14.580
She's likely to find someone else.

00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:15.874
(It'll be interesting.)

00:15:16.574 --> 00:15:19.044
How many men do you want to talk to?

00:15:19.914 --> 00:15:21.114
- Me?
- Yes.

00:15:21.274 --> 00:15:22.820
About two?

00:15:22.844 --> 00:15:24.320
"About two?"

00:15:24.344 --> 00:15:25.384
(Laughing)

00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:26.960
- Right.
- If it's two people...

00:15:26.984 --> 00:15:28.600
They should talk to the others too.

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:30.184
- It's too early in the game.
- Exactly.

00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:32.830
(The room shared by Bon
Hee, who got the most votes, )

00:15:32.854 --> 00:15:35.094
(and Ji Won, who got 0)

00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:37.924
Ji Yung wanted to go
running in the morning.

00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:39.910
He asked, "Will you join?"

00:15:39.934 --> 00:15:42.004
But I said, "I can't in the morning."

00:15:42.464 --> 00:15:43.441
Doing that...

00:15:43.465 --> 00:15:46.174
Do you have no interest in Ji Yung?

00:15:47.274 --> 00:15:48.680
- Ji Yung?
- Yes.

00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:50.504
I think he's a nice person.

00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:52.814
The girls in this room are very honest.

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:56.044
He seems bright,

00:15:57.114 --> 00:15:58.360
and confident.

00:15:58.384 --> 00:15:59.984
- You're totally right.
- Right?

00:16:00.384 --> 00:16:03.784
I think you should talk to him.
It was nice when I did last night.

00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:07.030
The thing is, I'm currently thinking,

00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:10.164
"How do I get through
this when I got zero votes?"

00:16:11.664 --> 00:16:13.034
I don't know.

00:16:15.864 --> 00:16:17.064
Be yourself.

00:16:17.234 --> 00:16:18.804
- Be myself?
- Be yourself.

00:16:21.134 --> 00:16:22.304
That's the hardest.

00:16:24.644 --> 00:16:29.144
(Ji Won, who is usually cheerful,
now has a lot on her mind.)

00:16:29.244 --> 00:16:32.290
- I'll talk to him if I can today.
- You should.

00:16:32.314 --> 00:16:33.754
(Knocking)

00:16:34.484 --> 00:16:36.760
- Yes?
- You two chat a lot.

00:16:36.784 --> 00:16:37.761
- You could hear?
- Yes.

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:38.854
I want to stretch here.

00:16:39.054 --> 00:16:40.100
- Go ahead.
- Come in.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.594
We talk a lot.

00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:45.334
(Ye Eun, another zero-vote
participant, joins the chat.)

00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:47.010
You're not going to stop talking
just because I'm here, are you?

00:16:47.034 --> 00:16:48.011
- Not at all.
- No.

00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:49.340
- We're like...
- Are we best friends?

00:16:49.364 --> 00:16:50.710
- It was about Ji Yung.
- You're best friends?

00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:53.734
We were talking about Ji Yung.
She and I just get along well.

00:16:55.804 --> 00:16:57.604
- I'm kind of...
- Yes?

00:16:59.174 --> 00:17:01.244
- Here's what I'm worried about.
- Okay.

00:17:01.914 --> 00:17:03.414
Am I too baby-like?

00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:05.984
- Baby-like?
- Am I like that?

00:17:06.014 --> 00:17:08.014
- Why?
- It's just that

00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:10.484
I'm not like that at all.

00:17:10.954 --> 00:17:13.454
- My usual image is...
- Yes?

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:17.324
Completely different from how I am now.

00:17:17.664 --> 00:17:19.670
- Did you change?
- Aren't you usually sharper?

00:17:19.694 --> 00:17:21.940
- I imagine you're more charismatic.
- Exactly.

00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:24.004
When I moved in, - Yes?

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:26.704
- I set my mind on something.
- I see.

00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:29.774
If I acted sharp like I usually do,

00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:33.890
it would have been the end for me.

00:17:33.914 --> 00:17:35.684
But

00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:39.584
did being bright and cheerful backfire?

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:41.800
That was what crossed my mind.

00:17:41.824 --> 00:17:43.024
It's exactly

00:17:43.324 --> 00:17:44.994
I had the same thought.

00:17:45.654 --> 00:17:48.324
Either way, while being here...

00:17:49.024 --> 00:17:51.564
At first, people were all awkward.

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:53.940
So, the things I did

00:17:53.964 --> 00:17:55.504
to lighten the mood

00:17:55.604 --> 00:17:58.950
wouldn't have seemed so attractive to men.

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:00.874
That thought occurred to me.

00:18:01.474 --> 00:18:05.220
Last night, I thought really hard

00:18:05.244 --> 00:18:08.244
about whether I was doing something wrong.

00:18:08.444 --> 00:18:11.214
- Ji Won felt the same.
- She felt the same.

00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:14.954
I think it's just part of the process.

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:16.930
The process of learning about myself.

00:18:16.954 --> 00:18:18.824
That's what we're here for, after all.

00:18:19.124 --> 00:18:21.444
I have to follow my heart so
that I won't regret anything.

00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:24.340
I believe that I should keep
focusing on my feelings.

00:18:24.364 --> 00:18:26.370
If you feel more comfortable
laughing at that moment,

00:18:26.394 --> 00:18:27.664
you really laugh.

00:18:27.994 --> 00:18:30.134
(Can I do that?)

00:18:30.434 --> 00:18:31.850
If you don't think laughing is necessary,

00:18:31.874 --> 00:18:33.610
you don't have to laugh.

00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:35.380
(The older women still have
worries when it comes to love.)

00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:37.544
(Meanwhile, in the
kitchen on the 1st floor, )

00:18:37.644 --> 00:18:41.414
(Sang Hyeon and Ji Yung
are preparing breakfast.)

00:18:41.984 --> 00:18:43.284
(Looking)

00:18:43.544 --> 00:18:45.054
(Hesitant)

00:18:47.514 --> 00:18:50.524
Did you have a long chat
with Bon Hee yesterday?

00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:52.424
He's checking on them.

00:18:52.754 --> 00:18:54.594
We did.

00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:57.724
Was your first impression
of her the best among them?

00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:00.674
(Sang Hyeon wants to know
what's on Ji Yung's mind.)

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:02.864
She's very responsive.

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.274
I thought we were on the same wavelength.

00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:12.644
Is there anyone else you want to talk to?

00:19:13.114 --> 00:19:14.174
Me?

00:19:15.284 --> 00:19:16.544
Other than Bon Hee.

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:18.514
I...

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:24.184
(Pondering)

00:19:24.654 --> 00:19:28.424
Appearance-wise, maybe Yeong Gyeong.

00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:30.600
It's Yeong Gyeong, appearance-wise.

00:19:30.624 --> 00:19:31.694
Good for Sang Hyeon.

00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:34.964
Good morning.

00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:39.634
(The younger men will
make breakfast today.)

00:19:40.204 --> 00:19:42.674
(Pulling)

00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:46.550
(Setting the table for the older women)

00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:48.220
Can I use this?

00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:50.490
(Ji Won and Mu Jin were
cleaning up the kitchen.)

00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:52.154
(Looking over)

00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:56.684
Where's Bon Hee?

00:19:56.854 --> 00:19:59.254
She's upstairs. She'll be down shortly.

00:19:59.794 --> 00:20:01.054
She'll come downstairs soon.

00:20:02.064 --> 00:20:03.964
(Grinning)

00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:06.210
- Bon Hee...
- Paris Baguette.

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:07.340
(He gets the bagels, hearing
that she'll be down soon.)

00:20:07.364 --> 00:20:08.364
Butter?

00:20:09.004 --> 00:20:11.164
- Or...
- Something else with cheese?

00:20:11.434 --> 00:20:12.410
Will she like that?

00:20:12.434 --> 00:20:13.680
(Selecting the bagels for Bon Hee)

00:20:13.704 --> 00:20:14.750
I'll take that.

00:20:14.774 --> 00:20:16.480
- Hi, Bon Hee.
- Good morning.

00:20:16.504 --> 00:20:18.990
- Did you sleep well?
- Hi, Bon Hee.

00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:21.014
- Did you sleep well?
- Bon Hee, we have bagels.

00:20:21.214 --> 00:20:23.684
Which one do you want? Is that all right?

00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:25.530
- We can put two.
- This is also a good one.

00:20:25.554 --> 00:20:26.630
- What else do we have?
- We have jambon beurre.

00:20:26.654 --> 00:20:28.430
You can have that. I'll
eat the one in the oven.

00:20:28.454 --> 00:20:30.300
I'll eat the one in the oven, so
you can eat the jambon beurre.

00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:31.400
The jambon beurre?

00:20:31.424 --> 00:20:33.224
(Pleased)

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:35.070
I'll go and eat first.

00:20:35.094 --> 00:20:36.094
Sure.

00:20:38.094 --> 00:20:40.064
I should drink milk with it.

00:20:40.534 --> 00:20:42.534
(Pushing)

00:20:42.634 --> 00:20:45.274
(Give me some milk, please.)

00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:47.834
- He said, "I should drink milk."
- Why?

00:20:49.704 --> 00:20:51.074
Why? What about it?

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:54.414
It was cute. He was like, "Give me some."

00:20:54.574 --> 00:20:55.760
(That was too much.)

00:20:55.784 --> 00:20:58.330
- "Give me milk, please."
- It's time to get over Mu Jin.

00:20:58.354 --> 00:20:59.454
That's not it.

00:20:59.554 --> 00:21:01.130
- What will you do?
- "Give me."

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:02.354
(She's just happy to see him.)

00:21:02.484 --> 00:21:04.524
I should drink milk with it.

00:21:05.024 --> 00:21:06.994
(Pushing)

00:21:07.094 --> 00:21:09.694
(Give me some milk, please.)

00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:13.694
(Bon Hee pours Mu Jin a glass of milk.)

00:21:15.264 --> 00:21:17.540
(And Mu Jin puts Bon
Hee's bagels on a plate.)

00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:19.174
It's so nice to see.

00:21:20.274 --> 00:21:22.180
There are small plates,

00:21:22.204 --> 00:21:23.604
- so we can take these.
- Okay.

00:21:26.914 --> 00:21:27.891
- Good morning.
- Hi.

00:21:27.915 --> 00:21:29.884
- Hi.
- Morning!

00:21:30.944 --> 00:21:32.030
Are you not eating any bread?

00:21:32.054 --> 00:21:34.514
He said he'd bring them.

00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:39.130
(Mu Jin brings a pile
of bread for Bon Hee.)

00:21:39.154 --> 00:21:41.024
Oh, there aren't any plates. Is there?

00:21:48.664 --> 00:21:49.880
(He only takes care of Bon Hee openly.)

00:21:49.904 --> 00:21:51.404
That's no joke.

00:21:52.534 --> 00:21:54.150
He's making a move.

00:21:54.174 --> 00:21:58.974
(And the younger men, who chose
Bon Hee last night, watch him.)

00:21:59.414 --> 00:22:00.391
Thanks.

00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:02.160
There's no cutlery.

00:22:02.184 --> 00:22:03.384
Oh, right.

00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:06.084
(Handing one over)

00:22:06.184 --> 00:22:07.254
This is good.

00:22:09.024 --> 00:22:13.824
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin
seem closer than yesterday.)

00:22:14.394 --> 00:22:18.810
(Will anyone be able to come between them?)

00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:20.494
(Glancing)

00:22:21.164 --> 00:22:23.240
This is giving me a headache.

00:22:23.264 --> 00:22:26.234
(How will their feelings
for each other change?)

00:22:27.704 --> 00:22:29.350
- We got something.
- We got a text.

00:22:29.374 --> 00:22:31.074
- Really?
- What does it say?

00:22:32.074 --> 00:22:35.684
(Only the older women
got a text after breakfast.)

00:22:35.984 --> 00:22:38.990
"You have What's in My Bag Dates today."

00:22:39.014 --> 00:22:41.254
"All females will gather
in the living room now."

00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:42.824
What's in My Bag Date?

00:22:44.584 --> 00:22:48.724
(What's in My Bag Date
awaits the older women?)

00:22:52.434 --> 00:22:53.764
Oh, bags.

00:22:54.764 --> 00:22:56.440
They're the men's bags.

00:22:56.464 --> 00:22:57.504
They're the men's.

00:22:59.074 --> 00:23:02.204
It says, "Pick a bag that
suits your preference."

00:23:02.304 --> 00:23:04.344
Oh, they can see them first.

00:23:05.044 --> 00:23:07.250
They can guess whose bag it is.

00:23:07.274 --> 00:23:11.614
Yes, they must guess
and find the one they want.

00:23:12.014 --> 00:23:14.290
You can check their
taste from their belongings.

00:23:14.314 --> 00:23:15.460
- You could.
- Yes.

00:23:15.484 --> 00:23:16.560
(They can get a glimpse of their taste.)

00:23:16.584 --> 00:23:18.794
Do we have to pick a bag each?

00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:21.394
One of the men won't
be going on a date, then.

00:23:22.664 --> 00:23:25.294
(There are 5 bags and 4 women.)

00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:27.440
(In the men's room in the meantime)

00:23:27.464 --> 00:23:29.080
You didn't get any text messages, did you?

00:23:29.104 --> 00:23:31.104
- No, not yet.
- Not me.

00:23:31.464 --> 00:23:32.534
I didn't.

00:23:33.604 --> 00:23:36.174
The women must be
picking their dates, right?

00:23:36.844 --> 00:23:38.180
Maybe they're doing something downstairs.

00:23:38.204 --> 00:23:39.444
That's what I think.

00:23:39.714 --> 00:23:41.074
Will one of us stay at home, then?

00:23:41.514 --> 00:23:42.744
(Inhaling sharply)

00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:44.184
I'm the only one sitting apart.

00:23:44.914 --> 00:23:45.914
Wait.

00:23:46.584 --> 00:23:49.424
Leaving one behind sounds so sad, though.

00:23:50.254 --> 00:23:51.360
I'm all ready to go.

00:23:51.384 --> 00:23:55.124
(Sang Won is worried about
everything for some reason.)

00:23:55.664 --> 00:23:57.870
Should I open this one first?

00:23:57.894 --> 00:23:59.034
Sure.

00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:04.080
In the first bag, there's a cap.

00:24:04.104 --> 00:24:05.081
(A pink cap in the first bag)

00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:07.950
- A pink cap.
- There's a cap.

00:24:07.974 --> 00:24:08.951
(A pink cap?)

00:24:08.975 --> 00:24:10.844
(Whose would it be?)

00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:13.850
- Cologne.
- It's a Tom Ford.

00:24:13.874 --> 00:24:16.484
- It's Oud Wood.
- Woody scent.

00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:18.344
And

00:24:18.914 --> 00:24:22.824
this looks like a band for working out.

00:24:22.924 --> 00:24:25.294
You can probably tell whose this is.

00:24:25.454 --> 00:24:27.930
- Doesn't it remind you of rugby?
- It's a Tom Ford.

00:24:27.954 --> 00:24:29.400
(The belongings remind them of someone.)

00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:31.464
I also think it's Ji Yung's bag.

00:24:31.824 --> 00:24:35.204
Everything's so big.

00:24:35.504 --> 00:24:36.640
Even the bag is.

00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:38.080
- Yes.
- Right.

00:24:38.104 --> 00:24:40.480
- And they're related to sports.
- Yes.

00:24:40.504 --> 00:24:42.074
And they're fancy.

00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:44.774
But the pink cap doesn't suit him.

00:24:45.174 --> 00:24:46.714
- Am I the only one?
- I agree.

00:24:47.414 --> 00:24:49.314
Whose bag do you think it is?

00:24:49.684 --> 00:24:51.660
- With the pink cap.
- Ji Yung is the best guess.

00:24:51.684 --> 00:24:54.084
But Sang Hyeon also works out.

00:24:54.754 --> 00:24:56.530
It might be Sang Hyeon's.

00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:58.160
- Either Sang Hyeon or Ji Yung.
- Sang Hyeon.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:25:00.354
I also think it's Sang Hyeon's.

00:25:00.454 --> 00:25:01.794
He also works out,

00:25:01.894 --> 00:25:04.794
and I think the pink cap will look
better on Sang Hyeon than Ji Yung.

00:25:05.164 --> 00:25:07.740
I expect to see scarier
exercise equipment

00:25:07.764 --> 00:25:09.034
in Ji Yung's bag.

00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:11.934
I honestly can't tell.

00:25:12.634 --> 00:25:14.480
Who does the feminine bag belong to?

00:25:14.504 --> 00:25:16.374
- I'll open it.
- Sure.

00:25:16.674 --> 00:25:18.344
The second bag is feminine.

00:25:20.274 --> 00:25:22.284
- A wallet.
- Wallet.

00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:24.660
- Cologne.
- Cologne.

00:25:24.684 --> 00:25:26.114
(His second item, cologne)

00:25:29.324 --> 00:25:30.524
- A bandana?
- A bandana?

00:25:30.954 --> 00:25:32.624
- A handkerchief?
- What?

00:25:32.724 --> 00:25:34.124
Isn't it a bandana?

00:25:34.494 --> 00:25:36.064
- A handkerchief?
- A handkerchief?

00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:38.794
Not many men carry handkerchiefs nowadays.

00:25:40.964 --> 00:25:42.280
Most of them wear it on their heads.

00:25:42.304 --> 00:25:44.304
That's so cute. Can you keep that on?

00:25:44.604 --> 00:25:45.581
It's so cute.

00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:47.150
Who are you?

00:25:47.174 --> 00:25:48.780
(A younger man who carries a handkerchief?)

00:25:48.804 --> 00:25:51.074
Judging from the style of the bag...

00:25:51.374 --> 00:25:53.450
- Mu Jin.
- Mu Jin?

00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:55.590
I can't imagine Mu Jin

00:25:55.614 --> 00:25:57.790
carrying such a slouchy bag.

00:25:57.814 --> 00:25:59.890
Oh, really?

00:25:59.914 --> 00:26:01.690
The fabric tells me that it's Sang Won's.

00:26:01.714 --> 00:26:03.254
- I see.
- Because of the material.

00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:07.194
He does have that image of a delicate man.

00:26:08.324 --> 00:26:09.840
I still think it's Mu Jin's.

00:26:09.864 --> 00:26:12.434
- Mu Jin's? Okay.
- I have a feeling.

00:26:12.764 --> 00:26:16.034
I can't tell at all.

00:26:16.404 --> 00:26:18.010
(The feminine bag belongs to...)

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:21.150
Isn't that what Hyeon Jun
wears when he's cooking?

00:26:21.174 --> 00:26:22.704
I thought the same thing.

00:26:23.604 --> 00:26:25.244
Should we open this one?

00:26:26.444 --> 00:26:28.490
First of all, I love the color of the bag.

00:26:28.514 --> 00:26:30.684
(The third bag is khaki-colored and big.)

00:26:30.784 --> 00:26:31.844
Glasses?

00:26:33.054 --> 00:26:34.190
- Sunglasses.
- Sunglasses.

00:26:34.214 --> 00:26:35.284
Should I open it?

00:26:35.624 --> 00:26:36.954
Let's see what type he wears.

00:26:37.824 --> 00:26:39.954
It's a little see-through.

00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:42.964
Like this. It's translucent.

00:26:43.064 --> 00:26:45.834
(Intrigued)

00:26:46.994 --> 00:26:48.334
- What?
- Another pair?

00:26:49.364 --> 00:26:52.434
(He carries two pairs of sunglasses?)

00:26:53.074 --> 00:26:54.474
Are you okay with this color?

00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:56.850
(Two pairs of sunglasses
with different designs)

00:26:56.874 --> 00:26:58.144
Those are Mu Jin's.

00:26:58.504 --> 00:26:59.490
No.

00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:01.550
Yes, I think Mu Jin wears
those types of glasses.

00:27:01.574 --> 00:27:02.590
Mu Jin would.

00:27:02.614 --> 00:27:04.260
Have you ever seen government employees

00:27:04.284 --> 00:27:05.854
going to work wearing sunglasses?

00:27:06.154 --> 00:27:07.684
Mu Jin would.

00:27:07.784 --> 00:27:10.824
No. Never. It's either
Sang Won or Hyeon Jun.

00:27:11.654 --> 00:27:12.854
No, it's Ji Yung's.

00:27:14.754 --> 00:27:16.164
It must be Mu Jin's bag.

00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:17.500
- Really?
- Do you think so?

00:27:17.524 --> 00:27:20.434
I was thinking of Hyeon
Jun because of the bag.

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:23.580
I thought the sunglasses
belonged to Hyeon Jun.

00:27:23.604 --> 00:27:24.604
Is this...

00:27:26.674 --> 00:27:30.374
And lip balm for lip care.

00:27:31.204 --> 00:27:33.214
- Hang on.
- Lip balm.

00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:35.144
Mu Jin or...

00:27:35.914 --> 00:27:38.490
And a mouth spray. It's a must-have item.

00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:39.690
Maybe it's Mu Jin's.

00:27:39.714 --> 00:27:42.154
I have a feeling it's Mu Jin's.

00:27:43.154 --> 00:27:46.124
I believe it's Mu Jin's.

00:27:46.924 --> 00:27:47.930
Yes, I think so too.

00:27:47.954 --> 00:27:51.124
He carries this type of stuff.

00:27:51.524 --> 00:27:53.264
So, he's considerate.

00:27:53.464 --> 00:27:54.710
- He must be.
- Yes.

00:27:54.734 --> 00:27:56.580
- That's the feeling I get.
- It looks like Mu Jin's.

00:27:56.604 --> 00:27:57.604
Yes.

00:27:58.504 --> 00:27:59.574
And...

00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:02.680
This one has a lot of stuff.

00:28:02.704 --> 00:28:03.704
Here...

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:06.650
- A flower wallet.
- Oh, my.

00:28:06.674 --> 00:28:07.844
A flower wallet?

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:10.490
(What's this?)

00:28:10.514 --> 00:28:11.544
Soothing cream.

00:28:11.814 --> 00:28:13.284
- Soothing cream?
- Soothing cream?

00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:17.300
BB cream for skin cover.

00:28:17.324 --> 00:28:18.870
(A bunch of cosmetics)

00:28:18.894 --> 00:28:20.130
Sunscreen.

00:28:20.154 --> 00:28:21.494
Why are there so many sunscreens?

00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:23.540
Why are there so many sunscreens?

00:28:23.564 --> 00:28:25.194
He must care a lot about his skin.

00:28:26.434 --> 00:28:27.810
- Sang Won?
- Sang Won?

00:28:27.834 --> 00:28:29.034
Oil-absorbing sheets.

00:28:29.264 --> 00:28:31.080
- Oil-absorbing sheets?
- I think it's Sang Hyeon's.

00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:32.081
Sang Hyeon?

00:28:32.105 --> 00:28:33.604
- Sang Hyeon?
- Sang Hyeon.

00:28:34.374 --> 00:28:36.944
- And lip balm.
- Lip balm.

00:28:38.444 --> 00:28:40.114
Sang Hyeon is

00:28:40.174 --> 00:28:42.290
- quite interested in skincare.
- Yes, I think it's Sang Hyeon's.

00:28:42.314 --> 00:28:43.720
(He's known for his expertise in skincare.)

00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:45.860
(They think it's Sang
Hyeon and not Sang Won.)

00:28:45.884 --> 00:28:48.184
Because Sang Won said

00:28:48.384 --> 00:28:50.030
that he forgot to bring any.

00:28:50.054 --> 00:28:52.130
(Flower wallet, eye drop,
sunscreen, soothing cream...)

00:28:52.154 --> 00:28:54.230
(Is this bag Sang Hyeon's, the
Golden Retriever who does skincare?)

00:28:54.254 --> 00:28:55.724
Should we open this one?

00:28:56.924 --> 00:28:58.694
(Surprised)

00:28:59.734 --> 00:29:01.010
(They come across dental
floss for the first time.)

00:29:01.034 --> 00:29:02.840
- Dental floss?
- Someone mentioned floss.

00:29:02.864 --> 00:29:03.904
Sang Hyeon!

00:29:04.104 --> 00:29:05.380
- It was Sang Hyeon.
- Sang Hyeon?

00:29:05.404 --> 00:29:06.850
He said he let them use it.

00:29:06.874 --> 00:29:07.950
It's Sang Hyeon again?

00:29:07.974 --> 00:29:10.044
Last night, Mu Jin came,

00:29:10.104 --> 00:29:11.780
and asked for dental floss,

00:29:11.804 --> 00:29:13.314
but no one had any. I said,

00:29:13.674 --> 00:29:15.420
- "Yeong Gyeong might have one."
- I do.

00:29:15.444 --> 00:29:16.890
- I told him that.
- I'll let you use it.

00:29:16.914 --> 00:29:18.584
I also have it. I'll lend it to you.

00:29:18.614 --> 00:29:19.654
(Speaking softly)

00:29:20.484 --> 00:29:22.984
I remember. I have a pretty good memory.

00:29:23.454 --> 00:29:25.260
(The item that follows dental floss)

00:29:25.284 --> 00:29:26.354
Hand soap.

00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:28.700
Bidet?

00:29:28.724 --> 00:29:30.370
- Who else is left?
- Bidet tissues?

00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:32.210
(They burst into laughter
as they never expected it.)

00:29:32.234 --> 00:29:33.810
You've got to be lying.

00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:35.064
Bidet tissues.

00:29:35.734 --> 00:29:37.480
- Okay.
- It's privacy.

00:29:37.504 --> 00:29:38.904
Let's just say they're wet tissues.

00:29:38.934 --> 00:29:42.674
There was a pack of very soft wet tissues.

00:29:42.744 --> 00:29:44.374
I found out

00:29:44.744 --> 00:29:49.090
that it was used in the bathroom.

00:29:49.114 --> 00:29:52.554
The fact that he had that in his bag

00:29:52.854 --> 00:29:55.260
whetted my curiosity.

00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:56.784
I thought,

00:29:57.684 --> 00:29:59.300
"Does it belong to a funny guy..."

00:29:59.324 --> 00:30:01.300
"Or a little crazy guy?"

00:30:01.324 --> 00:30:04.970
It made me look forward
to finding out who he was.

00:30:04.994 --> 00:30:06.510
(Is the bag with dental floss
and bidet tissues Sang Hyeon's?)

00:30:06.534 --> 00:30:08.240
This must be Hyeon Jun's.

00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:10.304
- I can't guess them at all.
- Then, this must be...

00:30:10.334 --> 00:30:11.540
- Hyeon Jun's.
- Hyeon Jun's.

00:30:11.564 --> 00:30:13.850
(So, the cosmetics bag belongs
to Hyeon Jun, not Sang Hyeon?)

00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:15.904
- Should we pick them now?
- Yes.

00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:17.380
Let's see.

00:30:17.404 --> 00:30:18.420
(They randomly pick a
number to decide on the order.)

00:30:18.444 --> 00:30:20.274
- It might change things.
- Who's number one?

00:30:21.114 --> 00:30:22.214
I'm number one.

00:30:22.514 --> 00:30:23.814
- I'm number 4.
- Number 3.

00:30:24.314 --> 00:30:25.420
I'm number two.

00:30:25.444 --> 00:30:26.684
(Number 2, Yeong Gyeong)

00:30:27.054 --> 00:30:28.554
- This is tough.
- It is tough.

00:30:28.754 --> 00:30:31.360
(It's harder to choose for the first one.)

00:30:31.384 --> 00:30:32.554
This is difficult.

00:30:33.054 --> 00:30:34.424
I'll pick this one.

00:30:34.924 --> 00:30:36.524
- This one?
- Okay.

00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:37.824
Great.

00:30:39.294 --> 00:30:41.694
I wanted to have one more chat with Mu Jin.

00:30:42.534 --> 00:30:43.634
Mu Jin.

00:30:43.904 --> 00:30:47.110
I saw lip balm in one of the bags,

00:30:47.134 --> 00:30:49.550
and I thought I remembered seeing it.

00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:51.450
All the other items in that
bag didn't look like Mu Jin's,

00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:53.044
but I was certain about the lip balm.

00:30:54.544 --> 00:30:57.614
So, I was really torn before I picked that.

00:30:58.184 --> 00:30:59.614
No, that's Ji Yung's.

00:31:01.114 --> 00:31:02.794
I'm 100 percent sure it belongs to Mu Jin.

00:31:02.884 --> 00:31:04.500
No, it can never be Mu Jin.

00:31:04.524 --> 00:31:07.370
Mu Jin may be a government
employee, but he's got style.

00:31:07.394 --> 00:31:09.824
No government employee
wears orange sunglasses.

00:31:10.364 --> 00:31:12.170
- They're different these days.
- Right.

00:31:12.194 --> 00:31:13.670
But those glasses would
look good on Mu Jin.

00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:14.810
Even his bag is well-organized.

00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:15.834
(She has a point.)

00:31:16.264 --> 00:31:17.780
(Yeong Gyeong will pick a bag next.)

00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:18.834
I

00:31:19.534 --> 00:31:20.674
I'll pick this one.

00:31:21.204 --> 00:31:23.904
(She picks one without hesitation.)

00:31:24.374 --> 00:31:27.944
There was a bag with dental floss inside.

00:31:28.314 --> 00:31:29.914
I had a feeling

00:31:30.114 --> 00:31:32.954
it would be Sang Hyeon's.

00:31:33.884 --> 00:31:34.861
(The evening on day 1)

00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:36.654
(How much liquor can you hold?)

00:31:37.054 --> 00:31:39.530
(I can drink one glass...)

00:31:39.554 --> 00:31:40.630
(of soju-beer cocktail.)

00:31:40.654 --> 00:31:42.070
- One glass?
- One glass?

00:31:42.094 --> 00:31:43.500
(Bursting into laughter)

00:31:43.524 --> 00:31:46.194
The one I wanted to talk to most

00:31:46.994 --> 00:31:48.164
was Sang Hyeon.

00:31:49.404 --> 00:31:50.434
Why?

00:31:50.764 --> 00:31:54.874
He talks calmly,

00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:58.304
and I could feel from the moment we met

00:31:58.904 --> 00:32:01.890
that he was a delicate guy.

00:32:01.914 --> 00:32:03.620
(She's been interested in
him from the first moment.)

00:32:03.644 --> 00:32:05.584
I want to get to know him better.

00:32:08.284 --> 00:32:10.754
I genuinely hope it's Sang Hyeon's bag.

00:32:11.524 --> 00:32:12.600
(Ye Eun will go third.)

00:32:12.624 --> 00:32:13.694
Ye Eun.

00:32:15.664 --> 00:32:17.870
I'll choose solely based
on the items in the bag.

00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:19.240
That's a good idea.

00:32:19.264 --> 00:32:23.640
Solely based on the items in the bag.

00:32:23.664 --> 00:32:26.480
(The feminine bag that everyone
guessed was Sang Won's)

00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:27.704
Sang Won.

00:32:28.904 --> 00:32:31.574
I went on a date with him last time,

00:32:31.844 --> 00:32:35.514
and I wanted to get to know him.

00:32:37.444 --> 00:32:40.014
Then, I'll pick this one.

00:32:40.184 --> 00:32:42.184
(Impressed)

00:32:42.724 --> 00:32:45.260
(The bag with lifting straps)

00:32:45.284 --> 00:32:46.324
Ji Yung.

00:32:47.524 --> 00:32:49.794
There were straps for workouts,

00:32:50.024 --> 00:32:53.594
so I picked it, thinking it
would belong to Ji Yung.

00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:56.910
(From the moment Ji Won met Ji Yung, )

00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:59.334
(she felt a strong attraction.)

00:32:59.904 --> 00:33:00.881
Yes.

00:33:00.905 --> 00:33:02.580
- What do we do with the other one?
- One bag is left.

00:33:02.604 --> 00:33:03.744
Oh, no.

00:33:04.074 --> 00:33:05.520
- Was it this one?
- Yes.

00:33:05.544 --> 00:33:07.790
- This one.
- He has moisturizing cream,

00:33:07.814 --> 00:33:09.490
- He's not chosen by anyone.
- Sunscreen,

00:33:09.514 --> 00:33:11.144
and everything.

00:33:11.914 --> 00:33:13.030
What do we do?

00:33:13.054 --> 00:33:14.784
(Who are the younger men that were picked?)

00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:18.324
In the end, one of
them will be left behind.

00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:20.554
- Is it bad?
- No, it's cute.

00:33:21.224 --> 00:33:22.464
That's not what I'm going for.

00:33:23.324 --> 00:33:25.094
(Disappointed)

00:33:26.934 --> 00:33:28.010
It looks nice.

00:33:28.034 --> 00:33:32.064
(He takes it off, hearing that it's cute.)

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:35.474
(Throwing it away)

00:33:36.574 --> 00:33:38.080
(Sang Hyeon and Hyeon Jun's room)

00:33:38.104 --> 00:33:40.314
(Sighing deeply)

00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:43.160
(Sang Hyeon stood in
front of the mirror to doll up.)

00:33:43.184 --> 00:33:45.954
He's at it again. He's applying something.

00:33:46.354 --> 00:33:48.014
"Get Ready with Sang Hyeon."

00:33:49.384 --> 00:33:50.854
(Wiping)

00:33:52.124 --> 00:33:56.524
(His touches are rough yet meticulous.)

00:33:57.124 --> 00:34:01.464
(Getting perfectly ready for the date)

00:34:02.194 --> 00:34:04.434
(He doesn't forget to style the back hair.)

00:34:08.404 --> 00:34:09.720
Do you have the brows?

00:34:09.744 --> 00:34:11.374
- Do you want to use mine?
- What?

00:34:11.874 --> 00:34:13.050
Eyebrows?

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:14.714
Do they mean the eyebrow razor?

00:34:15.214 --> 00:34:16.260
It's just a pencil.

00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:17.420
- Is that all right?
- Yes, that's fine.

00:34:17.444 --> 00:34:18.590
- Can I use it?
- Of course.

00:34:18.614 --> 00:34:19.974
- Thank you.
- I'll clean it first.

00:34:20.184 --> 00:34:21.260
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:34:21.284 --> 00:34:22.800
The tip is a little sharp because it broke,

00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.024
so be careful.

00:34:27.924 --> 00:34:29.124
What's going on?

00:34:29.724 --> 00:34:30.870
- He's drawing them.
- It's not a razor?

00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.294
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

00:34:33.394 --> 00:34:34.994
He wasn't a teto-guy, after all!

00:34:35.294 --> 00:34:36.664
He must know how to use it.

00:34:37.204 --> 00:34:39.380
Gen Z is certainly different.

00:34:39.404 --> 00:34:41.234
(Astonished at how much
things have changed)

00:34:42.034 --> 00:34:44.404
(Drawing)

00:34:44.444 --> 00:34:48.414
(His draws the eyebrows
while showing off his forearms.)

00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:53.214
(Ready to look pretty in
front of the older women)

00:34:53.854 --> 00:34:55.690
(Their partners are chosen
by which bags they pick.)

00:34:55.714 --> 00:34:56.824
I can't wait to find out.

00:34:57.484 --> 00:35:00.930
I hope it's a partner they want.

00:35:00.954 --> 00:35:02.600
(With the bags they chose, )

00:35:02.624 --> 00:35:03.840
(the older women wait for the younger men.)

00:35:03.864 --> 00:35:06.170
They're all dolled up nicely.

00:35:06.194 --> 00:35:07.234
They are.

00:35:07.794 --> 00:35:13.104
(Will they go on a date with
the younger men they wanted?)

00:35:16.504 --> 00:35:19.420
(The gate finally opens, )

00:35:19.444 --> 00:35:21.090
(and the first younger man comes out.)

00:35:21.114 --> 00:35:22.714
They're getting in that car?

00:35:23.084 --> 00:35:25.520
- How does this go?
- It's Mu Jin. Is it Mu Jin?

00:35:25.544 --> 00:35:27.654
(The first younger guy, Mu Jin)

00:35:28.854 --> 00:35:31.930
(Looking forward to it)

00:35:31.954 --> 00:35:34.530
Bon Hee picked the
bag, thinking it belonged

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:36.270
- to Mu Jin.
- She did.

00:35:36.294 --> 00:35:38.840
We can find out if she was right

00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:40.510
from which car...

00:35:40.534 --> 00:35:42.334
- Mu Jin gets into, right?
- Yes.

00:35:42.534 --> 00:35:43.734
This is brutal.

00:35:43.904 --> 00:35:45.640
He might take the car behind her

00:35:45.664 --> 00:35:46.874
- in the end.
- He could.

00:35:47.074 --> 00:35:48.334
She'd be so shocked.

00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:51.420
Do you have to own a
driver's license and a car

00:35:51.444 --> 00:35:52.814
to be a participant in the show?

00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:55.244
(Laughing)

00:35:58.884 --> 00:36:00.490
(He goes straight to his woman.)

00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:03.330
All the doors are on that side,

00:36:03.354 --> 00:36:04.860
so we don't know whose
car he's getting into.

00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:08.754
(Whose car will he take?)

00:36:10.024 --> 00:36:11.224
Oh, no.

00:36:12.294 --> 00:36:14.910
(Bon Hee)

00:36:14.934 --> 00:36:16.164
- No way.
- He passed by?

00:36:16.404 --> 00:36:18.640
- No, he hasn't gone yet.
- He walked past it.

00:36:18.664 --> 00:36:19.710
No, he didn't.

00:36:19.734 --> 00:36:21.834
- See? He's going to...
- Is he taking the first car?

00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:23.080
He walked by it!

00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:24.204
No!

00:36:24.874 --> 00:36:26.044
(Surprised)

00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:27.920
(Ye Eun's What's in My Bag Date is...)

00:36:27.944 --> 00:36:29.590
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:36:29.614 --> 00:36:30.884
(Mu Jin.)

00:36:31.384 --> 00:36:32.390
Ye Eun!

00:36:32.414 --> 00:36:33.391
(It can't be.)

00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:35.060
- Sang Won...
- Ye Eun thought

00:36:35.084 --> 00:36:37.424
- she had picked Sang Won's bag.
- You're right.

00:36:38.684 --> 00:36:40.370
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

00:36:40.394 --> 00:36:42.894
- Look at her face!
- Bon Hee!

00:36:43.024 --> 00:36:44.800
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

00:36:44.824 --> 00:36:46.164
(Laughing)

00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:48.894
I was so surprised.

00:36:49.234 --> 00:36:52.340
But I randomly got a chance

00:36:52.364 --> 00:36:55.134
to have a chat with him,

00:36:55.434 --> 00:36:57.244
so I thought it was good.

00:36:59.674 --> 00:37:01.044
Though I was surprised,

00:37:01.444 --> 00:37:03.714
she was one of the women

00:37:04.244 --> 00:37:07.884
that I wanted to have a
chat with other than Bon Hee.

00:37:09.184 --> 00:37:11.084
So, I was slightly relieved.

00:37:11.584 --> 00:37:13.830
He was also interested in Ye Eun.

00:37:13.854 --> 00:37:16.164
Did you have to pick something?

00:37:17.064 --> 00:37:18.964
- This bag.
- Oh, my bag?

00:37:20.794 --> 00:37:22.094
Did you know it was mine?

00:37:22.394 --> 00:37:25.134
I never knew it was
yours, so I was startled.

00:37:26.874 --> 00:37:28.204
Were you expecting someone else?

00:37:29.034 --> 00:37:30.544
Well

00:37:31.304 --> 00:37:33.414
I wouldn't say I was expecting anyone.

00:37:33.844 --> 00:37:35.604
I just liked the items in that bag the most.

00:37:36.584 --> 00:37:37.690
They were my type.

00:37:37.714 --> 00:37:39.754
(They were my type.)

00:37:40.084 --> 00:37:41.460
- TMT?
- What?

00:37:41.484 --> 00:37:42.584
"Totally my type?"

00:37:44.484 --> 00:37:46.870
Ye Eun and Mu Jin look cute together.

00:37:46.894 --> 00:37:48.654
- What do I do?
- They'll be a lovely couple.

00:37:49.194 --> 00:37:50.714
I think they'll be pretty lovey-dovey.

00:37:51.664 --> 00:37:53.170
- Gosh, seriously.
- Oh, no.

00:37:53.194 --> 00:37:54.240
She seems sad.

00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:55.264
Oh, gosh.

00:37:57.864 --> 00:38:01.680
I realized that my hunch
was right when I found it odd.

00:38:01.704 --> 00:38:04.550
I mean, he wouldn't wear sunglasses
with orange lenses like those.

00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:05.674
Exactly.

00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:07.020
Who could it be?

00:38:07.044 --> 00:38:10.284
(If it's not Mu Jin...)

00:38:11.044 --> 00:38:14.614
(Who could be the second
younger man to go on a date?)

00:38:14.714 --> 00:38:17.500
(Yeon House)

00:38:17.524 --> 00:38:19.130
(The second younger man, Sang Hyeon)

00:38:19.154 --> 00:38:21.800
Yeong Gyeong picked the bag

00:38:21.824 --> 00:38:23.000
- thinking that it was Sang Hyeon's.
- That's right.

00:38:23.024 --> 00:38:24.304
Let's find out if she was right.

00:38:24.494 --> 00:38:26.134
(Smiling)

00:38:27.034 --> 00:38:29.234
(He walks straight to
the car without hesitating.)

00:38:29.834 --> 00:38:32.180
(Who picked Sang Hyeon's bag?)

00:38:32.204 --> 00:38:34.410
- Is he going toward Yeong Gyeong?
- It's Yeong Gyeong.

00:38:34.434 --> 00:38:36.050
(Is it Yeong Gyeong who wanted Sang Hyeon?)

00:38:36.074 --> 00:38:39.144
(Or is it Bon Hee that Sang Hyeon wanted?)

00:38:44.014 --> 00:38:45.160
It's Yeong Gyeong. Or not?

00:38:45.184 --> 00:38:46.284
It's Yeong Gyeong.

00:38:46.314 --> 00:38:47.884
Oh, hello.

00:38:49.054 --> 00:38:52.800
(As Yeong Gyeong hoped, )

00:38:52.824 --> 00:38:53.900
(Sang Hyeon gets in her car.)

00:38:53.924 --> 00:38:54.924
Hello.

00:38:55.494 --> 00:38:56.624
(Nice. She guessed right.)

00:38:56.794 --> 00:38:58.700
- That's good.
- He went to the right person.

00:38:58.724 --> 00:39:00.534
That's good. It went as she hoped it would.

00:39:00.564 --> 00:39:01.564
Exactly.

00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:06.950
- I didn't expect you to be here.
- It's hot, isn't it?

00:39:06.974 --> 00:39:07.980
No, I'm fine.

00:39:08.004 --> 00:39:10.274
(He's taken aback as he didn't expect it.)

00:39:11.104 --> 00:39:13.214
By any chance, did you choose my bag?

00:39:13.814 --> 00:39:15.214
- Here's your bag.
- Oh, I see.

00:39:15.714 --> 00:39:17.684
- I'm returning it to you.
- Thank you.

00:39:18.584 --> 00:39:21.884
I wanted to apply it... I
had everything in this bag.

00:39:23.284 --> 00:39:24.454
Excuse me for a second.

00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:26.070
I won't watch you.

00:39:26.094 --> 00:39:27.294
I wanted to apply it.

00:39:27.624 --> 00:39:28.630
Oh, my.

00:39:28.654 --> 00:39:31.764
(He turns his head around
and applies his lip balm.)

00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:35.394
Sang Hyeon seems taken aback.

00:39:35.834 --> 00:39:37.234
Were you surprised?

00:39:38.364 --> 00:39:40.004
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

00:39:40.634 --> 00:39:42.580
(Chuckling)

00:39:42.604 --> 00:39:43.581
Well, I...

00:39:43.605 --> 00:39:45.620
(Half awkward, half excited.
(How will their first date be?)

00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:46.874
That's understandable.

00:39:49.614 --> 00:39:53.660
(The third younger man to go on a date)

00:39:53.684 --> 00:39:57.084
(Ji Yung)

00:39:59.354 --> 00:40:02.700
Ji Won picked the bag
thinking it was Ji Yung's.

00:40:02.724 --> 00:40:04.040
There's a 50-50 chance.

00:40:04.064 --> 00:40:08.634
(Only Bon Hee and Ji
Won's cars are left now.)

00:40:09.264 --> 00:40:11.364
(Curious)

00:40:11.664 --> 00:40:14.704
(Excited)

00:40:22.414 --> 00:40:23.560
Why is he getting in the backseat?

00:40:23.584 --> 00:40:24.714
It's not a taxi.

00:40:25.744 --> 00:40:28.230
(Surprised)

00:40:28.254 --> 00:40:29.454
Really?

00:40:30.584 --> 00:40:33.424
Looks like all our guesses were wrong.

00:40:34.124 --> 00:40:35.194
This is unexpected.

00:40:36.024 --> 00:40:37.840
Who is it? It seems like it's Bon Hee.

00:40:37.864 --> 00:40:38.864
I think it's Bon Hee.

00:40:39.864 --> 00:40:40.870
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

00:40:40.894 --> 00:40:42.440
(The bag that Bon Hee picked belongs to...)

00:40:42.464 --> 00:40:44.504
- My, this is so unexpected.
- I can't believe this.

00:40:45.104 --> 00:40:47.104
It's their second date
following the night before.

00:40:47.604 --> 00:40:49.684
I thought I should get in
the backseat for a moment.

00:40:50.244 --> 00:40:51.920
I was so surprised as you
were getting in the backseat.

00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:53.250
Exactly. We meet again.

00:40:53.274 --> 00:40:54.344
I know, right?

00:40:55.344 --> 00:40:56.860
You're wearing denim, not linen.

00:40:56.884 --> 00:40:57.964
Right. I chose denim today.

00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.960
- You look even younger.
- Do I?

00:40:59.984 --> 00:41:01.114
You look even younger.

00:41:02.414 --> 00:41:03.800
Did you choose me?

00:41:03.824 --> 00:41:05.030
I chose your bag.

00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:07.254
- Oh, you chose my bag?
- Yes.

00:41:08.754 --> 00:41:10.440
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, boy.

00:41:10.464 --> 00:41:11.470
(Ji Won picked the bag
thinking it was Ji Yung's.)

00:41:11.494 --> 00:41:13.740
"What a shame. I don't get to talk to him."

00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:14.894
That's what I was thinking.

00:41:18.704 --> 00:41:20.304
The men who are left in the house are...

00:41:20.404 --> 00:41:22.674
Hyeon Jun and Sang Won.

00:41:23.144 --> 00:41:27.914
(Is the last younger man
Hyeon Jun or Sang Won?)

00:41:28.344 --> 00:41:29.321
(Surprised)

00:41:29.345 --> 00:41:30.384
Oh, my goodness.

00:41:31.171 --> 00:41:35.141
The men who are left in the house
are Hyeon Jun and Sang Won.

00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:40.411
(Is the last younger man
Hyeon Jun or Sang Won?)

00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:41.887
(Surprised)

00:41:41.911 --> 00:41:42.951
Oh, my goodness.

00:41:43.951 --> 00:41:47.251
(Who's the younger man
who will sit next to Ji Won?)

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.297
(The last younger man, Hyeon Jun)

00:41:50.321 --> 00:41:51.691
- It's Hyeon Jun.
- It's Hyeon Jun.

00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:54.921
That means Sang Won wasn't
chosen by any of the women.

00:41:55.291 --> 00:41:57.091
This is bad. Oh, my goodness.

00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:01.361
Oh, Hyeon Jun came out.

00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:03.371
Oh, my. Hold on.

00:42:04.531 --> 00:42:06.971
- Sang Won is left alone, right?
- Yes.

00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:09.541
That's right.

00:42:10.541 --> 00:42:13.081
(The last younger man
turned out to be Hyeon Jun.)

00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:17.251
(Yeong Gyeong spots Hyeon Jun.)

00:42:17.881 --> 00:42:22.921
(Watching him going to another
car makes her feel strange.)

00:42:26.891 --> 00:42:29.891
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:32.507
- It must be quite tight for you.
- I'll push it back a little bit.

00:42:32.531 --> 00:42:33.731
Sure. Go ahead.

00:42:33.761 --> 00:42:35.107
He seems as if he
thinks, "This car suits me."

00:42:35.131 --> 00:42:36.477
(Chuckling)

00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.531
- I'll push it back all the way.
- Yes, go ahead.

00:42:38.701 --> 00:42:40.517
Is it too tight?

00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:41.677
No, it's fine.

00:42:41.701 --> 00:42:42.987
Can you push it back further?

00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:44.487
- This is as far as it can get.
- Really?

00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:46.187
I think it's because
there's a bag in the back.

00:42:46.211 --> 00:42:47.481
- It's okay.
- Is it?

00:42:48.911 --> 00:42:49.987
(The 4 younger men
have gotten in the cars.)

00:42:50.011 --> 00:42:52.021
Except Bon Hee and Ji Yung,

00:42:52.321 --> 00:42:55.121
everyone got paired up
with an unexpected person.

00:42:55.621 --> 00:42:56.621
It's a mess.

00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:58.367
Don't think that way.

00:42:58.391 --> 00:42:59.897
- This gives us a chance...
- It's interesting.

00:42:59.921 --> 00:43:01.837
To see new combinations.

00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:04.461
I believe this is a good thing
even though it was unexpected.

00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:06.107
After the date,

00:43:06.131 --> 00:43:08.361
some of them could find
their partners attractive.

00:43:08.501 --> 00:43:10.547
- I hope that will happen.
- If that happens...

00:43:10.571 --> 00:43:11.548
Right.

00:43:11.572 --> 00:43:12.717
It will become chaotic.

00:43:12.741 --> 00:43:14.217
(Will the new combinations bring chaos?)

00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:15.541
I wonder how this will turn out.

00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:17.648
Shall we get going now?

00:43:17.672 --> 00:43:19.211
(With hopes and excitement, )

00:43:20.281 --> 00:43:24.551
(What's in My Bag Date
begins, which will bring changes.)

00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:26.597
(Meanwhile, Sang Won
is still waiting in the room.)

00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:28.481
- Oh, no. Oh, gosh.
- Poor Sang Won.

00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:30.191
I feel bad for him.

00:43:31.421 --> 00:43:34.491
(When will I leave?)

00:43:35.491 --> 00:43:36.531
My goodness.

00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:38.061
He's wondering what's going on.

00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:55.611
(Sang Won, you have no
matches for today's date.)

00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:58.457
This is his second time
being chosen by no one.

00:43:58.481 --> 00:43:59.757
He wasn't chosen by
anyone on the first day either.

00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:01.757
(Was it because his bag had
too many skincare products?)

00:44:01.781 --> 00:44:04.497
(Why are bad feelings...)

00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:08.191
(always right?)

00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:10.607
At first, I thought it was okay
and that it was understandable

00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:12.431
since it was still the
beginning of the show.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.431
But being left alone in the
house made me feel strange.

00:44:17.171 --> 00:44:18.477
I was upset and confused.

00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.901
Of course, he's upset.

00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:22.647
What should I do while they're gone?

00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:26.011
(Sang Won is left alone in Yeon House.)

00:44:26.281 --> 00:44:28.927
Sang Won got zero votes before.

00:44:28.951 --> 00:44:30.281
This time, he's left alone.

00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:32.357
He's really unlucky.

00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:34.251
- Bad luck follows him.
- Exactly.

00:44:34.721 --> 00:44:37.591
I hope Sang Won won't

00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:40.597
- I mean, it's not his fault.
- Right. They were randomly chosen.

00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:43.531
It shouldn't make him feel
timid. But the situation is not good.

00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.877
What is he supposed to do alone at home?

00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:47.061
- He'll just rest.
- Cleaning?

00:44:48.231 --> 00:44:49.801
- Cleaning?
- Tidying up the house.

00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.041
The weather is so nice.

00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:57.147
It's been like this since you
came. Are you a weather fairy?

00:44:57.171 --> 00:44:58.647
Yes, I'm a weather fairy.

00:44:58.671 --> 00:45:00.141
(Proud)

00:45:01.341 --> 00:45:02.611
You see...

00:45:03.081 --> 00:45:06.051
Among the ladies, you're the one

00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:08.121
I've talked to the most.

00:45:09.251 --> 00:45:10.427
Although it was brief.

00:45:10.451 --> 00:45:12.991
So I think you know me
better than anyone else.

00:45:13.391 --> 00:45:16.031
How do you think of me? Is it
different from the first impression?

00:45:16.931 --> 00:45:18.307
- Do you think...
- You seemed much better

00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:19.337
after I talked to you.

00:45:19.361 --> 00:45:20.701
- Really?
- Yes.

00:45:21.231 --> 00:45:23.947
Did I seem like a thug
when you first saw me?

00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:25.147
As for my first impression of you...

00:45:25.171 --> 00:45:27.451
You have such a muscular
body, which was very impressive.

00:45:28.641 --> 00:45:30.341
It was like, "Pop."

00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:31.647
- "Pop?"
- "Pop?"

00:45:31.671 --> 00:45:33.017
That was my first impression of you.

00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:34.881
When you introduced yourself, - Yes.

00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:39.621
You seemed to have a sense
of responsibility for your work.

00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:43.827
You came across as prudent and reserved.

00:45:43.851 --> 00:45:45.121
That's how you seemed to me.

00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:47.567
But at the same time, you
have a good sense of humor.

00:45:47.591 --> 00:45:48.621
Really?

00:45:49.361 --> 00:45:52.031
As a professional athlete,
you're supposed to work hard.

00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:53.737
- That's only right.
- Exactly.

00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:56.147
But you didn't make it sound only serious,

00:45:56.171 --> 00:45:58.407
which showed your sense of
humor. You know what I mean, right?

00:45:58.431 --> 00:45:59.941
- So...
- You noticed that?

00:46:00.171 --> 00:46:01.471
You're observant.

00:46:01.871 --> 00:46:04.647
So I found out that you
were mentally relaxed.

00:46:04.671 --> 00:46:05.887
(He's even mentally relaxed too.)

00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:09.727
Some people get less
attractive as you talk to them.

00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:11.951
But you became more
charming as I talked to you.

00:46:12.521 --> 00:46:15.197
What you just said makes
me feel more confident.

00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:16.967
- Really?
- Yes, it makes me feel...

00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:18.297
(Bon Hee keeps Ji Yung's self-esteem up.)

00:46:18.321 --> 00:46:21.791
(Thanks to her, Ji Yung's
confidence level rose.)

00:46:23.261 --> 00:46:24.661
Do you want to get married?

00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.007
I do now. I didn't want that before.

00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:28.151
You didn't want that before?

00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:29.631
Now I want to get married.

00:46:30.971 --> 00:46:32.341
If I find a good man,

00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:36.141
I think I could live a happy married life.

00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:40.117
It'd be the best if I could
live with a companion

00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:41.211
like a best friend.

00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:45.251
Right. I have the same
perspective on marriage.

00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:47.221
I share the same idea of marriage.

00:46:48.021 --> 00:46:49.727
If I meet the right person for me,

00:46:49.751 --> 00:46:52.267
I think I would get married right away.

00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:53.731
- Following your gut feelings?
- Yes.

00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:56.667
(Holding back a smile)

00:46:56.691 --> 00:46:58.591
I can't wait to find out the ages.

00:47:01.461 --> 00:47:03.301
I think Sang Won is the
oldest among the guys.

00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:04.507
- I see.
- Sang Won?

00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.041
I have a feeling that he is,
which would be unexpected.

00:47:08.441 --> 00:47:10.311
And I think Mu Jin is the youngest of all.

00:47:14.811 --> 00:47:16.227
(Another couple heading
to their dating place)

00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:19.651
The weather is so nice. I
love it when it's sunny like this.

00:47:21.281 --> 00:47:22.351
Are you good at driving?

00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:27.091
I drove a convertible before I got this car.

00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:30.067
The only way I relieve stress is

00:47:30.091 --> 00:47:32.061
to drive with the roof open.

00:47:32.731 --> 00:47:34.931
That makes me feel so good.

00:47:35.031 --> 00:47:37.301
Do you mind if I go faster?

00:47:37.971 --> 00:47:40.441
(He holds the handle, being playful.)

00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:42.687
(Raising the other hand)

00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:43.841
That's so cute.

00:47:44.941 --> 00:47:46.881
(She finds him cute.)

00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:48.281
She said it was cute.

00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:51.951
- It's game over.
- She just said it out loud.

00:47:52.681 --> 00:47:53.957
- It's game over.
- She finds him cute.

00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:54.981
(Is that cute?)

00:47:55.221 --> 00:47:57.127
(Raising the other hand)

00:47:57.151 --> 00:47:58.251
That's so cute.

00:47:59.491 --> 00:48:01.291
(She finds him cute.)

00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:03.961
(Mu Jin's prank lightened the mood.)

00:48:04.461 --> 00:48:05.807
The car might explode.

00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:07.101
(Joking)

00:48:11.401 --> 00:48:14.441
When you chose the bag, did you
wish it belonged to someone particular?

00:48:15.241 --> 00:48:17.171
Well... To be honest,

00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:22.041
there were a few men I
wanted to talk to at first.

00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:25.981
And you were one of them.

00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:27.427
He was one of them?

00:48:27.451 --> 00:48:29.451
One of the men you wanted to talk to?

00:48:30.451 --> 00:48:31.991
(Thinking)

00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:35.491
I wanted to talk to you, but...

00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:37.661
But

00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:40.231
you seemed to be so
clear about whom you liked.

00:48:40.861 --> 00:48:45.201
So it was a bit difficult
for me to approach you.

00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:46.747
And... Well...

00:48:46.771 --> 00:48:48.247
(Hesitating)

00:48:48.271 --> 00:48:49.787
What...

00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.917
(Embarrassed)

00:48:50.941 --> 00:48:54.411
I made eye contact with you many times.

00:48:54.711 --> 00:48:55.911
(Realizing)

00:48:57.781 --> 00:48:59.481
That's good. Ye Eun, you're doing great.

00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:02.251
Why doesn't Mu Jin respond to that?

00:49:03.051 --> 00:49:07.091
I mean... I got this
feeling when I saw you.

00:49:07.291 --> 00:49:09.767
- What?
- The one I felt attracted to

00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:11.091
among all the guys.

00:49:11.491 --> 00:49:14.461
And you were the one
I got that feeling about.

00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:17.471
You got that feeling?

00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:20.501
I found you attractive
when I first saw you.

00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:24.417
Expressing your feelings like that

00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:25.687
helps you get him interested.

00:49:25.711 --> 00:49:26.711
(Smiling)

00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:30.951
Was there a particular reason
you wanted to talk to me?

00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:34.951
I liked your fashion style.

00:49:35.281 --> 00:49:36.951
(Realizing)

00:49:37.921 --> 00:49:39.991
And your belongings in the bag

00:49:41.521 --> 00:49:43.091
I liked those too.

00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:44.391
I liked everything.

00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:52.131
Who did you want to be in the car?

00:49:53.401 --> 00:49:55.301
- The person I wanted to be with?
- Yes.

00:49:57.741 --> 00:49:59.311
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:01.557
(Mu Jin is contemplating.)

00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:03.341
I think there's an
answer she wants to hear.

00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:05.781
It's a secret.

00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:10.291
- I knew it.
- Good job.

00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:13.361
Why won't you tell me?

00:50:15.061 --> 00:50:17.191
(Smiling)

00:50:17.831 --> 00:50:20.177
(Hesitating)

00:50:20.201 --> 00:50:22.401
Do I seem high-spirited?

00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:24.631
- Do you seem high-spirited?
- Yes.

00:50:25.101 --> 00:50:26.547
You don't seem very calm.

00:50:26.571 --> 00:50:27.741
- Really?
- Yes.

00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:31.811
The thing is... That's why

00:50:32.011 --> 00:50:36.027
I don't usually act cute.

00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:39.957
But as I tried to be friendly and outgoing,

00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:42.891
I found myself acting cute
more than I thought I would.

00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:44.697
I realized that.

00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:47.997
And that made me worry...

00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:49.467
(Because she acted more
cheerful to bond with the others...)

00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:51.691
If the guys thought I was too childish.

00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:55.107
The thought crossed my mind,

00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:57.431
and worried me a little bit.

00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.517
It's not who I am, but just a side of me.

00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:06.057
I was afraid you guys
might think of me that way.

00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:07.481
It worried me.

00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:09.751
But I think that's what makes you charming.

00:51:10.781 --> 00:51:11.781
What makes me charming?

00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:14.451
- The way you act cute.
- I see.

00:51:14.551 --> 00:51:15.631
And you're good with words.

00:51:16.121 --> 00:51:18.391
You're bubbly and cheerful.

00:51:18.851 --> 00:51:20.891
You caught my attention because of that.

00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:25.331
(Ye Eun smiles happily.)

00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:28.207
- They look great together.
- Right.

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:30.901
(It'll be fun to watch
their unique chemistry.)

00:51:31.431 --> 00:51:34.517
(Yeong Gyeong and Sang
Hyeon are heading to a restaurant.)

00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:36.387
I also have a tendency to do that.

00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:39.841
You seem to be very
cautious about what you say.

00:51:40.241 --> 00:51:41.411
- Oh, me?
- Yes.

00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:44.027
- Oh, I see.
- Those who talk slowly,

00:51:44.051 --> 00:51:46.421
including myself, have something in common.

00:51:46.951 --> 00:51:50.267
Even when we talk a lot,
people don't really notice it.

00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:51.997
- Oh, I get it.
- Don't you think so?

00:51:52.021 --> 00:51:54.761
- That's right.
- I talked quite a lot,

00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:57.661
but people think I'm a quiet person.

00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:59.877
They say I don't talk much.

00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.871
That's right. Also, since we speak slowly,

00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:06.041
when there are many people around me,

00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:09.617
they would jump in

00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:11.711
- while I'm talking.
- Right.

00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:13.517
So I guess that naturally makes me

00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:15.811
- talk less.
- Right.

00:52:16.081 --> 00:52:17.151
Absolutely.

00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:19.227
Things are going well between them.

00:52:19.251 --> 00:52:21.131
- They're alike.
- It's going well between them.

00:52:21.581 --> 00:52:24.697
I wanted to talk to
you when we first met...

00:52:24.721 --> 00:52:25.721
Yes.

00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:29.791
Well... Because I like a man
who is caring and sincere,

00:52:30.131 --> 00:52:33.807
and who has a gentle, mild nature.

00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:36.301
- I see. Yes.
- Such a man suits my personality.

00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:41.941
On the first day, I saw
that you had hurt your hand.

00:52:42.571 --> 00:52:44.011
Yes, I did.

00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:47.117
(When they were having
apples that Sang Hyeon peeled...)

00:52:47.141 --> 00:52:49.381
(Did you get hurt while
peeling the apples?)

00:52:49.651 --> 00:52:53.781
(Yeong Gyeong spotted the
wound, which no one else noticed.)

00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:58.167
Seeing that you hurt your
hand while peeling the apples,

00:52:58.191 --> 00:52:59.761
for everyone,

00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:03.367
- I thought you were thoughtful.
- Really?

00:53:03.391 --> 00:53:05.531
That crossed my mind.

00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:07.601
(Surprised)

00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:12.841
(Yeong Gyeong expresses
her feelings honestly.)

00:53:13.741 --> 00:53:16.771
(Her compliments make him smile.)

00:53:17.471 --> 00:53:20.541
(While getting to know each
other, they arrive at the destination.)

00:53:22.751 --> 00:53:26.121
(The date planned by Yeong Gyeong)

00:53:28.881 --> 00:53:31.497
- That place is beautiful.
- It's nice.

00:53:31.521 --> 00:53:33.081
(A French restaurant with exotic vibes)

00:53:39.531 --> 00:53:40.931
(Impressed)

00:53:41.661 --> 00:53:43.247
This is such an elegant place.

00:53:43.271 --> 00:53:46.147
- "Elegant?" That's funny.
- Why would you say that?

00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:47.601
(Smiling)

00:53:48.441 --> 00:53:50.641
- It's beautiful, right?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

00:53:51.441 --> 00:53:53.211
(Flustered)

00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:59.751
(He pours water into a
glass for Yeong Gyeong first.)

00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:01.721
(Glancing)

00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:04.751
(Chuckling)

00:54:05.021 --> 00:54:06.021
Why?

00:54:08.721 --> 00:54:12.431
Should I tuck this into my
collar or spread it on my lap?

00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:16.477
(Chuckling)

00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:18.001
- Here?
- Is that right?

00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:20.771
Is that right? Should I
tuck it into my collar?

00:54:21.801 --> 00:54:23.187
You should tuck it into the collar.

00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:24.641
(Joking)

00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:27.887
(He does as she says.)

00:54:27.911 --> 00:54:29.011
Is this right, really?

00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:31.527
- He's so cute.
- Come on, Yeong Gyeong.

00:54:31.551 --> 00:54:32.528
(Only SOOBIN has no opinion on it.)

00:54:32.552 --> 00:54:34.357
That is so cute.

00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.521
(My, he's so cute.)

00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:38.667
(He does as she says.)

00:54:38.691 --> 00:54:39.791
Is this right, really?

00:54:40.491 --> 00:54:42.561
(She finds him cute.)

00:54:43.731 --> 00:54:45.207
(Taken aback)

00:54:45.231 --> 00:54:47.351
- Oh, this should be... Okay.
- Spread it on your lap.

00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:49.501
That was cute.

00:54:49.871 --> 00:54:51.377
That was cute.

00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:52.877
(Shy)

00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:55.441
He tucked it into his collar.

00:54:56.811 --> 00:55:01.281
It was a new side of
him. I found him so cute.

00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:06.157
I thought, "He sure is a younger man."

00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:07.261
(He sure is a younger man.)

00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:10.451
I don't go to a fancy
restaurant like this often.

00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:11.967
Really?

00:55:11.991 --> 00:55:14.591
Of course. Only when I go on a date

00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:18.031
I only go to such a
place on a special date.

00:55:20.901 --> 00:55:23.731
(Looking around)

00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:26.071
- This place suits you.
- Sorry?

00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:28.217
Your outfit suits the place too.

00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:29.487
(He compliments her without
looking at her, which is his specialty.)

00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:32.047
- Oh, the place suits me?
- Yes, it suits you well.

00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:33.641
- Because of my outfit?
- Yes.

00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.781
This place suits you very well.

00:55:39.951 --> 00:55:41.051
You picked a nice place.

00:55:41.351 --> 00:55:43.751
(He's talking to the air as he feels shy.)

00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.238
Thank you.

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:49.907
(Meanwhile, bread is
served as an appetizer.)

00:55:49.931 --> 00:55:51.161
Eat a lot.

00:55:51.231 --> 00:55:52.391
Shall I give you one?

00:55:53.861 --> 00:55:55.221
- I haven't used these yet.
- Sure.

00:55:55.601 --> 00:55:56.607
That's nice of you.

00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:57.731
(Surprised)

00:55:59.541 --> 00:56:00.601
What are you doing?

00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:03.611
- You basically threw it.
- That wasn't my intention. Sorry.

00:56:03.711 --> 00:56:06.687
I'm not used to these things.
I'd appreciate it if you find it cute.

00:56:06.711 --> 00:56:09.011
He said, "I'd appreciate
if you find it cute."

00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:12.611
- I'll enjoy it. Thank you.
- I'm not used to these things.

00:56:13.481 --> 00:56:15.381
The butter is cut nicely.

00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:18.221
Shall I put it on the
bread so that it melts?

00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:21.461
(Skillful)

00:56:21.561 --> 00:56:24.691
(Unlike Yeong Gyeong,
who's used to it, Sang Hyeon...)

00:56:24.861 --> 00:56:26.177
(He doesn't know what to do.)

00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.537
He can use his hands.

00:56:27.561 --> 00:56:29.337
I guess he can't use his
hands thinking it's bad manners.

00:56:29.361 --> 00:56:30.371
He's doing as she does.

00:56:30.871 --> 00:56:32.701
He watches Yeong Gyeong and copies her.

00:56:34.401 --> 00:56:36.141
Oh, my. It's good.

00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:39.941
I didn't even know how
to put the fork down.

00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.911
I didn't know if I should
use the butter knife,

00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:46.851
or the other knife on the table.

00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:49.321
Since I didn't even know that,

00:56:49.621 --> 00:56:51.697
I thought, "We're different."

00:56:51.721 --> 00:56:53.337
(He realized that he's had
different experiences from her.)

00:56:53.361 --> 00:56:56.091
I meant to dress up and look nice.

00:56:56.761 --> 00:57:00.807
But I just put on a shirt,
which looks quite casual.

00:57:00.831 --> 00:57:04.671
She was wearing a two-piece
outfit. She was like a city girl,

00:57:05.071 --> 00:57:08.047
and I was like a country
boy. A country bumpkin.

00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:09.911
That's how it was.

00:57:10.011 --> 00:57:13.911
And the city girl took me
to a French restaurant.

00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:17.157
(The city girl and country boy
went to a French restaurant.)

00:57:17.181 --> 00:57:18.251
It's good.

00:57:19.181 --> 00:57:20.451
- Is it good?
- Yes.

00:57:21.381 --> 00:57:23.467
(After checking Sang Hyeon, )

00:57:23.491 --> 00:57:25.621
(Yeong Gyeong takes a bite too.)

00:57:25.921 --> 00:57:27.721
(Peeking)

00:57:29.991 --> 00:57:32.861
I think it's our first
time to talk face-to-face.

00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:37.131
It's the first time. Yes.

00:57:38.671 --> 00:57:41.141
We didn't have a chance to talk.

00:57:41.641 --> 00:57:43.817
It's me too.

00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:46.141
I become like a robot, you see.

00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:51.081
When I feel awkward, I become like a robot.

00:57:52.281 --> 00:57:53.521
Do you feel awkward?

00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:57.321
(Giggling)

00:57:57.551 --> 00:57:58.797
(Staring)

00:57:58.821 --> 00:57:59.921
Oh, dear.

00:58:00.921 --> 00:58:01.937
(Eyes fixed on him)

00:58:01.961 --> 00:58:03.591
He won't look her in the eye.

00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:07.937
When he was with Ye Eun,
he couldn't look at her either.

00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:09.001
Right.

00:58:09.301 --> 00:58:11.447
(When he went on his first date, )

00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:14.501
(Sang Hyeon couldn't
look at his date either.)

00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:17.011
It's the third day, you know.

00:58:17.441 --> 00:58:18.617
Since it's the third day,

00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:21.611
I want him to be more aggressive.

00:58:21.911 --> 00:58:23.457
But he's just too shy.

00:58:23.481 --> 00:58:24.887
- Who is?
- And it frustrates me a little.

00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:26.157
- Sang Hyeon?
- Yes.

00:58:26.181 --> 00:58:27.797
I want him to be a little more aggressive.

00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:29.651
- Are you frustrated?
- A little.

00:58:30.691 --> 00:58:32.621
(Amazed)

00:58:32.961 --> 00:58:34.721
- It looks so good.
- I know.

00:58:34.821 --> 00:58:37.967
I haven't had a good
steak like this in a long time.

00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:39.491
- Is that right?
- A thick one.

00:58:39.801 --> 00:58:41.031
Do you like it?

00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:42.907
I love it, of course.

00:58:42.931 --> 00:58:44.277
Can I dig in? Should we eat together?

00:58:44.301 --> 00:58:45.431
Go ahead.

00:58:46.031 --> 00:58:47.141
Eat a lot.

00:58:47.171 --> 00:58:48.301
(Shaking)

00:58:48.801 --> 00:58:50.971
(Slicing)

00:58:51.771 --> 00:58:54.487
(Yeong Gyeong watches
Sang Hyeon slicing the steak.)

00:58:54.511 --> 00:58:56.451
(Staring)

00:58:58.081 --> 00:58:59.081
(Peeking)

00:58:59.281 --> 00:59:01.051
Why are you staring at me?

00:59:01.851 --> 00:59:03.897
(Giggling)

00:59:03.921 --> 00:59:05.791
I wanted to see if you were eating well.

00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:07.291
It's good.

00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:09.261
- Is it good?
- Yes.

00:59:09.491 --> 00:59:12.361
(She keeps staring.)

00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:14.777
Please stop. You should eat too.

00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:15.901
- "Please stop."
- Okay.

00:59:16.601 --> 00:59:17.701
Enjoy.

00:59:17.931 --> 00:59:19.741
Enjoy.

00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:26.481
(Finally, Yeong Gyeong eats the steak.)

00:59:27.281 --> 00:59:28.487
Look at this tiny cabbage.

00:59:28.511 --> 00:59:29.541
(Fascinated)

00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:32.111
That's grilled, so it must be really yummy.

00:59:32.551 --> 00:59:33.751
Savory and sweet.

00:59:36.151 --> 00:59:37.367
(Yum)

00:59:37.391 --> 00:59:38.491
It's good.

00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:41.361
Do you want to eat mine too?

00:59:42.361 --> 00:59:44.507
(The country bumpkin likes it.)

00:59:44.531 --> 00:59:46.601
Is your hobby making someone eat good food?

00:59:47.231 --> 00:59:49.201
- Yes.
- Really?

00:59:50.231 --> 00:59:51.931
I'm very pleased right now.

00:59:52.231 --> 00:59:53.671
I'm happy that you're enjoying it.

00:59:54.871 --> 00:59:56.001
It's really good.

00:59:56.911 --> 00:59:59.387
I love going to a good restaurant.

00:59:59.411 --> 01:00:00.411
Do you?

01:00:01.511 --> 01:00:04.887
If the person I went
to the restaurant with

01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:07.581
enjoys the food, that makes me happy.

01:00:08.621 --> 01:00:10.191
I love being happy

01:00:10.751 --> 01:00:13.421
with the person I'm with.

01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:18.561
So it's important to me that
the other person is happy.

01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:20.131
I'm happy right now.

01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:22.861
- You look happy.
- I am really happy.

01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:24.901
This is so good.

01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:27.671
I'm glad to hear that.

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:31.641
Everything Yeong Gyeong
says shows how thoughtful she is.

01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:35.057
She's different from
when she's with Hyeon Jun.

01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:36.058
- Right.
- She's different.

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:37.451
- She adores him.
- Yes.

01:00:37.781 --> 01:00:39.721
What would you do if
you were in that situation?

01:00:40.051 --> 01:00:42.197
Imagine the girl you're on a
date with keeps staring at you

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:43.521
without eating.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:47.091
I wouldn't be as
uncomfortable as Sang Hyeon.

01:00:47.621 --> 01:00:48.967
- I would be...
- Not too uncomfortable.

01:00:48.991 --> 01:00:50.407
I would just think it
pleases her to see me eat.

01:00:50.431 --> 01:00:52.067
And that would make me happy.

01:00:52.091 --> 01:00:54.437
"It pleases her to see me eat"
sounds a bit strange, doesn't it?

01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:56.477
- What's wrong with that?
- "Pleases her"?

01:00:56.501 --> 01:00:57.847
You should apologize to her.

01:00:57.871 --> 01:00:59.431
That's not it.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:00.617
When you say it pleases her,

01:01:00.641 --> 01:01:03.111
it makes the older woman flinch a little.

01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:05.487
Does it make you seem like his superior?

01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:07.257
Right.

01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.381
It's difficult.

01:01:11.111 --> 01:01:12.357
That's how sensitive they are.

01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:13.781
(I should be careful.)

01:01:14.221 --> 01:01:17.391
I wanted to hear

01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.861
more about what you do.

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:23.691
I thought hard about
how to introduce my job.

01:01:24.061 --> 01:01:26.537
(Focused)

01:01:26.561 --> 01:01:27.831
I will put it easily.

01:01:27.931 --> 01:01:31.447
There must be a record about
what stocks you've bought.

01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:33.771
You need to keep that record somewhere.

01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:38.811
And someone has to manage that record.

01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:41.687
My job is to manage

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.857
those data.

01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:47.157
- That's so easily put.
- Database management.

01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:50.621
The person who manages it is
called a database administrator.

01:01:50.921 --> 01:01:53.161
And it's shortened as DBA.

01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:55.561
That's what I do.

01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:57.491
Mr. DBA.

01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:02.231
It's my first time to
explain my job this way.

01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:04.907
- You explained it well.
- I did well, didn't I?

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:06.777
It was very easy to understand.

01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:07.947
I'm proud of myself.

01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:09.371
(He's proud of himself.)

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.311
I understood it perfectly.

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.641
I love being complimented.

01:02:14.641 --> 01:02:15.841
- You do?
- Yes.

01:02:16.081 --> 01:02:17.781
(He's cute.)

01:02:18.181 --> 01:02:19.411
I'm very proud.

01:02:20.351 --> 01:02:22.751
You clearly sound like an INFP person.

01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:29.737
One of the reasons I
wanted to talk to you is...

01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:30.791
Yes.

01:02:31.191 --> 01:02:34.077
When I do the MBTI compatibility test,

01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:35.078
Yes.

01:02:35.102 --> 01:02:37.231
It always says that I'm most compatible

01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:40.077
with an INFP person.

01:02:40.101 --> 01:02:41.371
- Really?
- Yes.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:42.941
Are you type ENFJ?

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.611
I am type ENFJ.

01:02:46.941 --> 01:02:48.641
What was your ideal type again?

01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:54.221
Someone who looks cold,
someone who looks like a cat.

01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:56.151
I think that's my type.

01:02:56.851 --> 01:03:00.521
I don't mind it if she's
picky and particular.

01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:04.207
I'm the type of person
who's okay with everything.

01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:07.201
I tend to be like that.

01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:11.171
So I can go along with how she is.

01:03:12.171 --> 01:03:15.401
You seem to be a very understanding person.

01:03:16.571 --> 01:03:18.611
(Shy)

01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:20.881
How about you, Yeong Gyeong?

01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.281
- Me?
- Yes.

01:03:22.611 --> 01:03:26.521
When I'm in a relationship,

01:03:26.621 --> 01:03:27.951
I give my everything to it.

01:03:28.281 --> 01:03:29.967
But when it's over,

01:03:29.991 --> 01:03:33.791
I have no regrets, and no holding back.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.191
That's amazing.

01:03:36.891 --> 01:03:37.991
She's amazing.

01:03:40.401 --> 01:03:41.761
Are you okay dating a younger man?

01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:44.001
A younger man?

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:49.771
I don't think age matters much.

01:03:50.741 --> 01:03:52.387
I wouldn't like or not like someone

01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:55.041
just because he's younger.

01:03:55.281 --> 01:03:56.341
Whether

01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:00.457
he is meant for me or
not is more important.

01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.921
(Whether he is meant for
me or not is more important.)

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:06.991
You are a deep person.

01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:08.591
You have the power...

01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:11.961
- Me?
- To draw someone in.

01:04:12.731 --> 01:04:14.001
Did he just say that?

01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:15.631
But he still can't look at her.

01:04:18.971 --> 01:04:23.571
I loved that I got to talk to him.

01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:29.081
I found everything about him to be cute.

01:04:30.111 --> 01:04:31.911
I felt very comfortable.

01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:35.751
It made me want to

01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:37.591
get to know him more.

01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:43.161
It looks like Sang Hyeon is
starting to have feelings for her.

01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:44.537
- I don't think so.
- Really?

01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:46.307
Compared to the first time.

01:04:46.331 --> 01:04:47.701
He had no interest in her at all.

01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:49.507
- He had zero interest.
- Here's what I think.

01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:51.431
Yeong Gyeong got who she wanted,

01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:54.477
so she must've been
very happy with the date.

01:04:54.501 --> 01:04:57.271
- Yes.
- I think, honestly, she wasn't

01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:01.481
the date Sang Hyeon wanted.

01:05:02.181 --> 01:05:04.581
I thought Sang Hyeon

01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:08.151
didn't have much interest in her.

01:05:08.751 --> 01:05:11.167
I couldn't tell if this was a
date or a business meeting.

01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:12.421
He didn't

01:05:13.191 --> 01:05:14.837
ask about her type,

01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:17.967
her taste, or her hobby.

01:05:17.991 --> 01:05:19.891
He wasn't curious about her at all.

01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:22.137
- Right.
- He talked about his job.

01:05:22.161 --> 01:05:23.701
- He wasn't curious about her.
- Right.

01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:25.301
He didn't ask questions.

01:05:25.471 --> 01:05:28.201
I think only Yeong Gyeong
was curious about her date.

01:05:28.371 --> 01:05:30.247
- You're right. Sang Hyeon wasn't.
- They weren't questions

01:05:30.271 --> 01:05:31.517
- you would ask a woman you like.
- Right.

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:34.217
They weren't questions you would
ask a woman you are interested in.

01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:35.241
Right.

01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:37.881
It's here.

01:05:38.251 --> 01:05:39.957
I said I was craving grilled tripe.

01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:41.181
- Grilled tripe?
- Yes.

01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:43.997
- I am so curious...
- Should we sit here?

01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:45.861
- About how they would turn out.
- Sounds good.

01:05:46.591 --> 01:05:48.221
Let's take a seat.

01:05:49.261 --> 01:05:51.391
You were craving meat yesterday.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.561
Yes.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:54.177
I really wanted to eat meat.

01:05:54.201 --> 01:05:55.331
- Really?
- Yes.

01:05:55.761 --> 01:05:57.431
I didn't think of tripe though.

01:05:58.771 --> 01:06:00.301
You've had it before, right?

01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:01.901
- I've had it before.
- Right?

01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.341
- So you like tripe.
- Tripe?

01:06:05.611 --> 01:06:07.217
It's good.

01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:09.121
I thought you wouldn't
eat something like that.

01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:11.127
No, I like it.

01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:12.711
(Shy)

01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:17.397
Why do you carry that hat in your bag?

01:06:17.421 --> 01:06:19.051
It's the hat I wear the most often.

01:06:19.951 --> 01:06:21.621
Did it surprise you that it's pink?

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:24.291
I just thought, "It's colorful."

01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:25.961
You didn't smell it, did you?

01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:29.661
I didn't.

01:06:29.931 --> 01:06:31.671
It doesn't smell though.

01:06:32.131 --> 01:06:33.747
I wash my hair before wearing a hat.

01:06:33.771 --> 01:06:35.277
The hat looked clean.

01:06:35.301 --> 01:06:36.377
- Did it?
- Yes.

01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:38.311
(Relieved)

01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:40.941
Thank you.

01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:43.811
It was pre-cooked, so we can eat it.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:47.521
Do you usually eat tripe in the daytime?

01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:48.771
- No.
- In dinnertime, right?

01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:49.851
Yes.

01:06:51.021 --> 01:06:52.691
I'm going to remember this.

01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:56.907
- Right?
- I never imagined eating it now.

01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:57.991
I know.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:02.531
Is there any date you want to go on?

01:07:04.171 --> 01:07:05.901
I want to go on a cooking date.

01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:09.211
- Cooking together?
- Getting groceries and cooking.

01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:10.541
That's nice.

01:07:11.341 --> 01:07:13.741
(Hyeon Jun wants to
show off his cooking skill.)

01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:18.627
Is there anyone else
you want to get to know,

01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:20.481
and talk to?

01:07:20.881 --> 01:07:22.281
That's a frequently asked question.

01:07:22.351 --> 01:07:23.827
There is, but it's a secret.

01:07:23.851 --> 01:07:24.951
Really?

01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:27.061
Well done.

01:07:28.391 --> 01:07:29.421
I see.

01:07:29.561 --> 01:07:31.007
I have a lot of secrets.

01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:33.471
(When it's a difficult question,
he just says it's a secret.)

01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:37.777
(Hyeon Jun won't reveal
what he's thinking to Ji Won.)

01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:41.747
- It's not easy for Hyeon Jun.
- Why is it not easy?

01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:45.087
It's always been Yeong
Gyeong for Hyeon Jun until now.

01:07:45.111 --> 01:07:46.088
Right.

01:07:46.112 --> 01:07:48.232
(Hyeon Jun had been after
Yeong Gyeong consistently.)

01:07:54.121 --> 01:07:55.751
- Hyeon Jun, look.
- Yes?

01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:02.021
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:04.961
(Hesitating)

01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:07.837
I don't know if you remember.

01:08:07.861 --> 01:08:09.031
What? Remember?

01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:10.921
Something must've happened between the two.

01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:13.471
But I know you.

01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:15.677
- You do?
- Yes.

01:08:15.701 --> 01:08:16.741
How do you know me?

01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:20.047
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun know each other?)

01:08:20.071 --> 01:08:21.181
How does she know him?

01:08:22.676 --> 01:08:23.976
But I know you.

01:08:24.776 --> 01:08:26.292
- You do?
- Yes.

01:08:26.316 --> 01:08:27.316
How do you know me?

01:08:28.946 --> 01:08:30.732
(Ji Won and Hyeon Jun know each other?)

01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:31.856
How does she know him?

01:08:35.726 --> 01:08:36.996
I once asked,

01:08:37.996 --> 01:08:39.996
for your number.

01:08:42.736 --> 01:08:45.266
(Everyone freezes.)

01:08:45.336 --> 01:08:46.366
What?

01:08:50.436 --> 01:08:53.122
(I once asked...)

01:08:53.146 --> 01:08:56.276
(for your number.)

01:08:58.646 --> 01:09:01.046
(Flustered)

01:09:01.116 --> 01:09:02.122
(Right.)

01:09:02.146 --> 01:09:03.186
Yes.

01:09:03.986 --> 01:09:05.786
Are you still there then?

01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:07.256
Yes.

01:09:07.326 --> 01:09:11.056
I live in the area. I
was very surprised too.

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:12.866
Yes.

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:17.136
I asked for your number myself.

01:09:17.396 --> 01:09:19.466
At the time, I was

01:09:20.566 --> 01:09:23.706
interested in you, so I
asked for your number.

01:09:24.676 --> 01:09:26.082
(Nodding)

01:09:26.106 --> 01:09:27.176
Right.

01:09:28.946 --> 01:09:31.416
You might not remember me.

01:09:32.146 --> 01:09:34.226
- So that's what happened.
- Yes. I was so surprised.

01:09:34.846 --> 01:09:36.186
How can the world be so small?

01:09:36.886 --> 01:09:38.516
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- It is.

01:09:41.086 --> 01:09:46.396
(What's the story of Ji Won and Hyeon Jun?)

01:09:47.426 --> 01:09:50.466
- I was working out at a gym.
- At a gym?

01:09:50.736 --> 01:09:53.482
And appearance-wise, he was

01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:55.436
completely my type.

01:09:55.866 --> 01:09:58.776
So I asked for his number.

01:09:59.376 --> 01:10:01.646
But it didn't turn into

01:10:01.946 --> 01:10:04.822
a relationship.

01:10:04.846 --> 01:10:06.062
So they talked.

01:10:06.086 --> 01:10:09.862
I just knew his name.

01:10:09.886 --> 01:10:12.462
He didn't turn her down,
but things didn't work out.

01:10:12.486 --> 01:10:15.356
(After time passed, they
met again by chance.)

01:10:15.686 --> 01:10:17.472
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:10:17.496 --> 01:10:19.232
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:22.326
There was someone tall and handsome.

01:10:22.966 --> 01:10:24.336
Our eyes locked,

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:28.436
and I couldn't believe we met here again.

01:10:29.036 --> 01:10:31.276
I was flustered and surprised.

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:33.176
Honestly, I panicked a little.

01:10:33.206 --> 01:10:34.822
That must've been shocking.

01:10:34.846 --> 01:10:37.546
She said she asked for my number.

01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:40.446
Actually,

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:42.962
that's when I realized it.

01:10:42.986 --> 01:10:46.226
That she was that lady.

01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:48.986
It ended as a happening.

01:10:52.526 --> 01:10:53.566
That's why

01:10:54.996 --> 01:10:58.572
I couldn't talk to you
when we were in the house.

01:10:58.596 --> 01:10:59.612
That's why...

01:10:59.636 --> 01:11:00.782
(Ji Won couldn't approach him.)

01:11:00.806 --> 01:11:02.006
- Hold on.
- Yes.

01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:05.752
I had to think about
how to tell you about it.

01:11:05.776 --> 01:11:07.576
- Right, it's hard.
- I had to think about it.

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:09.382
So, yes.

01:11:09.406 --> 01:11:12.846
(Ji Won used this chance to bring it up.)

01:11:12.916 --> 01:11:14.892
- So that's what happened.
- I think it made things awkward.

01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:16.356
Let's be the same.

01:11:16.816 --> 01:11:18.962
Let's not be embarrassed.

01:11:18.986 --> 01:11:21.062
You should just do what you want to do.

01:11:21.086 --> 01:11:22.302
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:11:22.326 --> 01:11:23.902
- I will do that.
- That happened before.

01:11:23.926 --> 01:11:25.596
- Right.
- That happened then.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.026
Great. Eat some more.

01:11:29.936 --> 01:11:30.936
Okay.

01:11:31.066 --> 01:11:33.426
- I lost my appetite suddenly.
- We are from the same place.

01:11:34.906 --> 01:11:38.612
(Their paths crossed in the past.
(What's going to happen to them?)

01:11:38.636 --> 01:11:40.176
- Now you know.
- Yes.

01:11:40.776 --> 01:11:42.606
How can this happen?

01:11:44.016 --> 01:11:46.422
The two people whose
paths crossed in the past

01:11:46.446 --> 01:11:49.046
- came to meet again.
- What a small world.

01:11:49.856 --> 01:11:52.816
Should we say it's fate?

01:11:53.326 --> 01:11:55.202
- It can be fate.
- Or is it a bad connection?

01:11:55.226 --> 01:11:56.526
It can be fate.

01:11:57.056 --> 01:11:59.502
I think Hyeon Jun
could be a little flustered.

01:11:59.526 --> 01:12:02.396
But when someone is that honest with him...

01:12:02.936 --> 01:12:05.942
"Hyeon Jun,"

01:12:05.966 --> 01:12:08.106
"I had an interest in you."

01:12:08.606 --> 01:12:09.706
In a way,

01:12:10.006 --> 01:12:11.736
Ji Won made a bold move.

01:12:11.876 --> 01:12:14.376
It's an all-or-nothing situation.

01:12:14.506 --> 01:12:16.252
I never expected this.

01:12:16.276 --> 01:12:17.452
(What will happen to the two
who crossed paths in the past?)

01:12:17.476 --> 01:12:19.762
(The random dates of the
younger men and women continue.)

01:12:19.786 --> 01:12:21.586
I've been wanting to talk to Mu Jin.

01:12:22.146 --> 01:12:24.192
Ye Eun was one of the girls

01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:26.526
I wanted to talk to, so it felt good.

01:12:26.886 --> 01:12:29.132
(They feel the happy flutter
they haven't felt in a while.)

01:12:29.156 --> 01:12:32.756
I wanted to talk to him.

01:12:33.696 --> 01:12:35.866
(New emotions rise.)

01:12:38.296 --> 01:12:40.606
(Excuse me.)

01:12:40.636 --> 01:12:41.942
(A new older woman comes...)

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:44.336
(to the empty Yeon House.)

01:12:45.006 --> 01:12:47.146
She's on another level.

01:12:48.476 --> 01:12:50.356
(I've never seen someone
like that in my life.)

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:51.936
(She's closest to being my type.)

01:12:52.016 --> 01:12:53.616
(Finally, it's today.)

01:12:54.086 --> 01:12:55.686
(I was bothered.)

01:12:56.186 --> 01:12:59.886
(Subtle tension arises among the ladies.)

01:13:01.286 --> 01:13:02.426
It's getting more confusing.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.396
I'm puzzled.

01:13:04.696 --> 01:13:07.772
I was always

01:13:07.796 --> 01:13:09.736
into Bon Hee.

01:13:15.136 --> 01:13:16.706
But these two are already too solid.

01:13:16.736 --> 01:13:18.212
- It's not like that.
- It's not like that.

01:13:18.236 --> 01:13:20.476
We are close, but we are competing.

01:13:21.046 --> 01:13:26.186
(As time passes, the younger
men starts to reveal their feelings.)
